0,7,Florence Pugh <3 Black Widow is not bad movie. For me is very nice. Scarlet Johanson is top level at this movie. PUGH is FABULASTIC!!! FANTASTIC play from Florence. David Harbour is very humoristic man and he is brilliant.
1,1,"Trash A bunch of Action scenes, that has a trash story. This movie pacing is too fast, it's scene hopping for an hour straight, slow-normal pacing would of been better for this story."
2,6,"Had the potential to be great, squandered with weak script and direction. I have loved Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow since the classic interrogation scene in Iron Man 2. Have looked forward to seeing this. Unfortunately it does not live up to the hyped-up expectations. The set-up is long and drawn out in a protracted opening where nothing happens until an explosion and a fight over the 'magic potion McGuffin'.The strongest feature of the movie is the introduction of Florence Pugh as the pseudo-sister. Pugh's poking at Widow is relentless especially with the running 'poser' gag, 'cool way to die' etc. The dynamic between Johansson and Pugh works well, but the dysfunctional pretend family is strained and unnatural. Ray Winstone is cast as Ray Winstone with a terrible Russian accent and is absent throughout. Don't get me started on the pheromones nonsense, although Widow's solution to this is hilarious.Sad-to-say this is a travesty of what could and should have been a fabulous movie."
3,9,"The Female of The Species is more Deadly Marvel Managed to get this one Right after a Mediocre Couple of Mishaps with Thor the Dark World and then Loki the Series which Did nothing for me and was a huge Disappointment.So to Hit the Mark With Black Widow in all respects of Story,Action and Outright Chemistry between Johannsen and Pugh was Enlightening.If I had to Give any Negative then it would be why oh why Cast Ray Winstone as a Russian Baddie when He can really only do a Cockney Accent in every Movie he does,I'm Sure there were better options for his part. Other than that a Great Offering from Marvel."
4,1,"Quite a bit of Ho-Hum As a fan of SciFi, I tried to catch up on the latest ""SciFi"" releases of the last few years that I missed. This movie came up. Watching it almost made my lunch come up. The weak, watery story and the interminable scenes of female wrestling (marginally better, I suppose, than watching males wrestling) could be improved by the protagonists accidentally falling in a vat of baked beans for those prolonged fight scenes. Not funny, not serious, not interesting, not SciFi..."
5,4,"Black Widow A very deserving farewell for a beloved character in MCU. However, unlike other superheroes, Black Widow as a character simply lacks the punch that other characters possess. Perhaps better equipped to be made as a more traditional spy movie, Black Widow is stuck between that and a Marvel flick. It lacks the touch of magic and the film feels flat. Also would have liked to see more of Natasha's past before she became Black Widow. The ending however is quite fulfilling, an honest and heartfelt farewell."
6,9,"I really enjoyed this film. It was action packed and kept me hooked all the way through and the cast were so good, Scarlett Johansson is always good, but I was so impressed with Florence Pugh, she was brilliant, it's nice to see David Harbour and also great to see the beautiful Rachel Weisz.I'm a little bit baffled by the low score as in my opinion it's better than many of the other marvel films."
7,1,I should have read the reviews Slow ... dumb ... not entertaining.Made me think of how great the first Iron-Man was ... and how this movie never captured my attention like it did.
8,10,"It was very enjoyable It was very enjoyable. I didn't have any expectations though and knew that this will not be a superhero movie like Thor, Guardians of the galaxy and so on. I knew it was going to be more of a soldier or spy kind of thing like james bond and so on. Having said that, it was fun and enjoyable. I loved the jokes and the story flowed smoothly."
9,3,"I was hoping for some fun or action But no luck! Why not? Marvel and Disney that is why!Also no sister nudity. Hate on nature much? Body issues because you are fat? Well, she is not and we also like to see women because we admire them."
10,7,"Better than what people say. This is definitely not the worst MCU movie. I enjoyed many parts of it. The opening was entertaining. Florence Pugh and David Harbour steal the movie however. I'm excited to see more of them in the MCU. Most of the action scenes worked for me. The story is meh. Not the best swan song for Black Widow. And the cgi is pretty bad. But overall, it's a middle of the road MCU movie."
11,2,"Too little too late Join ScarJo as she battles Marvel audiences for some form of mediocrity. Horrible film; decent one liners, ok performances. But not needed nor memorable. Inane ""girl power"" action that while stellar feels too little and too late to be anything but really a vehicle to introduce Pugh the new canonical Black Widow for the upcoming dark AVENGERS."
12,5,"Slow And Boring The plot was very slow, boring, and uninteresting for me. The action scenes were nothing special, and the main villain is a generic bad guy, who could be defeated by anyone in the MCU with very little effort. In other words, I felt this movie was unnecessary, especially after the events in Endgame. I would highly recommend skipping this one! You are not missing out on anything in this movie!"
13,4,Just boring. One of those Marvel movies I stop at half time and then just skim til the end. Just boring. One of those Marvel movies I stop at half time and then just skim til the end. Just boring. One of those Marvel movies I stop at half time and then just skim til the end. Just boring. One of those Marvel movies I stop at half time and then just skim til the end. Just boring.
14,6,"Filler. I honestly do not get why have they done a film about a character that they already gave a proper ending. This film does nothing more than introducing a new black widow. The film look like a lazily written rip off of Mission Impossible. The villains were terrible, especially Taskmaster who has better character development in a PS4 game Marvels Spider - Man."
15,5,Being punched in the face never looked so good. These sisters take a lot of damage and still look good. Way over the top with too many women fighting. A 14 year old's dream. At one point I yelled girl fight! 5 / 10 because of the hot chicks. Flo looks great!
16,1,Snooze fest Incredibly boring. Started slow and went downhill from there. The forced Russian accents are truly terrible. Lots of vague external references. Not at all what I expected.
17,10,"Honest and Biased! I am admitting right upfront that I'm being biased in giving this movie a rating of 10/10! Well,to begin with,this is quite a good movie,where the character development was phenomenal,specially that of Yelena(played by Florence Pugh)! Seeing Scarlett Johansson made me feel sad,tbh,since this movie's a prequel to the Endgame(2019),and we all know that Black Widow's gone for good there(unless MCU adopts the Multiverse Theory as shown in the WHAT IF Series)!!David Harbour was Funny and Energetic,quite good actually! But the sole reason for me rating this 10/10(an unbiased rating from my perspective wouldve been 7.5/10) is Rachel Weisz,a.k.a. THE MOST STUNNING WOMAN EVER! Period.💯❤"
18,6,"What's the point of dragging black widow's past?? I don't feel the necessity of knowing black widow's story at all. Maybe MCU is out of story and that's why pulling all this unnecessary stories into it. However, I would love that if the story was decent, it just too boring.... :3."
19,6,"If it was on it's own I'd probably give this 7-8 stars because it actually wasn't bad. Why I give it a 6 is the point of the movie in the MCU timeline makes zero sense.Being on the run is fine and catching up with her family was ok, but she's fighting a global criminal org, basically Hydra pt 2, so where have they been this whole time?Putting this in the timeline between a couple of the best in the series with Civil War and Infinity didn't do it for me. And since they did that, where'd everyone go after? They just jump to the end credits and she's gone."
20,2,Boring as hell Movie is way too boring and also very slow.star cast is good but the story isn't that good.only 2 star for it.marvel should stick to avengers now.a flop movie.
21,8,It was good but there was more potential It was good but it should have been set before civil war so there could be a second one with Natasha romanoff I also think there was a lot of potential for taskmaster that wasn't used she should have been male but his face kept secret like the mandolrian he should have been in the second one as the absolute main villain but make it look Like he died like he was on the ship when it crashed but survived and the post credit seen was just his mask lighting up so he's it was good but alot of wasted potential.
22,3,Good acting couldn't save the bad writing The movie had good acting. But the stern was very meh. The jokes mostly felt forced.It was probably the second worth movie in the MCU behind Iron man 2. Up to that point at least. Eternals was definitely worse though. So it's not the 3rd worse movie.
23,10,"Awesome Movie, kick ass heroine For me this was the best, most enjoyable movie of 2021.What makes a great movie for me?1. i don't notice the movie as i am watching it, i am completely involved in it for all the playtime, from the trailers to the credits.👍 2. The second point is harder to describe but i guess i would say that it's the story is organic, it all goes together very well, it has an authenticity and realness to it.👍 included in both of these is wonderful acting, great cinematography, and a great story, plus a kick ass heroine."
24,6,Just OK I don't know who to blame Disney or Marvel .. but this movie has nothing to do with anything.. so plain.. not much action not much adventurous.. VFX not upto mark.. everything.. is not what Marvel was previously famous for.. is ruined .
25,2,She can't act. Now people can finally stop asking for a solo Black Widow film. Come on... we all KNEW this was going to su&k. They hype up the Russian version of Captain America and all his fight scenes put together total maybe 3 minutes. This is a by the numbers generic bore.
26,6,C+ (flat 6). July 21' @Regal Solid action sequences and moments that are bogged down by a mediocre story. Unfocused narrative. Too many ideas thrown in with little to no depth to them. No payoff.
27,7,"Good movie, shame Ray Winston was in it Totally unsuitable actor, whoever cast him ruined it. However quite entertaining, would watch again. Another chapter BW Avenger worth the watch discovering more origins of all of the Avengers."
28,2,"THE FINAL MARVEL MOVIE No, not the final Marvel movie ever made. The final Marvel movie that I will ever watch, let alone buy. What absolute piffle. The director, famous for nothing, created a movie that had plenty of action and very little else to make it worthy of more than 2 stars. I gave two stars for the occasional bits of comedy provided by the Alexei character."
29,2,"Trash widow Black Widow is a movie that I've wanted to see for years, ever since Civil War I've wanted a solo movie about her and we finally got it, too bad it was an epic fail.Black Widow is one of the worst marvel movies ever made, the fight scenes are absolutely terrible, it's insanely predictable, and the villain is one of the worst, they did such a bad job with her.It also has one of the worst lines of dialogue I've ever heard at the end and this is a filler movie, it just seems like a placeholder for other things in the future.Did it also seem like fanfic written by a 13 year old girl? Yep, did I only watch it for the post credits scene? Yep.Why does Yelena have no accent in the beginning but she does as an adult? It makes no sense. Black Widow is a really cool hero with a really interesting backstory but they failed in every way. Florence Pugh carried and she was the only good part. The finale is horrible.Black Widow is one of the worst Marvel movies, and I'm gonna give it a D-"
30,4,"You don't need to watch this one. This character should've stayed dead after Endgame.Scarlett earned an extra star after buttfuxking Disney with that lawsuit, but yeah I made myself watch this for the sake of giving it a chance and I'll never need to see it again.It's not awful just extremely forgettable. Who at Disney decided to give the most boring character in the MCU their own standalone?"
31,6,"Black Poop First of all, stop calling Black Widow a superhero! She is not a SUPER-hero. She's an extremely skilled and dangerous assassin. That's it. Nothing super about her, except for the ridiculous amount of times that she has suffered concussions and still able to walk around like a supermodel afterwards. In real life, she'd be dead long before this movie half way done. Like in the first action scene, she would've been dead already. This movie is nothing more than a spy action movie, not a superhero movie. Do we really need to see more ordinary heroes? Urgh... I only put 6 stars in it just to pay my respect to Stan Lee. Otherwise, I would've given it a 4. This is the worst Marvel movie ever since The Hulk."
32,5,"Mcu Is not cinematic Black widow Is more concerned checking of all the boxes (not rubbing anyone the wrong way. Instead of being a fun enjoyable movie It takes zero risks. Some scenes are just ridiculusly bad. Since when Is It not ok with sexy poses and having a sister that thinks It looks bad? Haha What? Natasjas sister should be on her side. Since when could superheroes take this much beating and explotions?Before the movie Is over you could think she Is Superman. Flying around bounching on airplane junk, 50 explotions in her face kind of strong and then do battle with supervillain.Its just to much unnesessary cgi crap.The movie would have been alot better If they just cut out all the cgi and did It oldschool all the way. But that's the problem with mcu.It's not cinematic. Batman the dark night Is cinematic. Heck! All batman movies I could easily call a Cinematic feat In their own ways.Black widow Is just not. Bitchplease It's 70% cgi that looks like a videogame, bad jokes, bad story, and why does the women always fight echother before talking. Its just weird.Every woman She meets wants to kill her literally."
33,9,"Long overdue Natasha Romanoff had been in the mcu for 10 years before getting a solo movie. While the movie was long overdue, it did not disappoint. This was exactly the sendoff Natasha deserved. The plot was jumpy at times and there were a few plot holes, but it was for the most part easy to follow and engaging. Florence Pugh did an incredible job at portraying Yelena Belova and I am excited to see her in future mcu projects."
34,3,"Deeply Tedious Black Widow is a very pointless film. It doesn't introduce anything meaningful into the MCU, and there's nothing inspired about it. It's just easily digestible content, which is forgotten about the moment the credits role. The opening is promising but it quickly goes downhill. All in all, it's a pointless film, that introduces nothing, and doesn't challenge anything."
35,5,Typical Superhero Movie Bad guy tries to destroy world. Brave hero/heroes stop him.Really tired of the whole concept. The movies are repeating it over and over again.The movies need to come up with new concepts rather than focusing on these repeated ideas.
36,10,The best marvel film Amazing back story. The best marvel film. Loved every second of it and thought all the characters were fantastic. Emotional too. Really hope there will be a second one.
37,8,"Deadly Russian dolls. I think that I am quite hard to please when it comes to superhero films, but Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh are definite plus points. Of course, a decent script and plenty of mind-blowing action also helps and I'm glad to say that Black Widow delivers both a strong story and lots of incredible, special effects packed set-pieces. For those not overly familiar with every entry in the MCU, the film might prove a little confusing at first, but it all eventually slots into place and ultimately proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster comic-book adventure.As children, Natasha and Yelena are part of a Russian sleeper cell based in Ohio, their 'father' Alexei (David Harbour) and 'mother' Melina (Rachel Weisz) working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone), who oversees the Red Room academy where young girls are trained to be assassins: Black Widows. After completing their mission, the family escape the U. S. and the girls are sent to Dreykov for training. Twenty-one years later, Natasha (Johansson) has defected to America to become a member of the Avengers, and is now on the run as a fugitive (can't remember why); meanwhile, Yelena (Pugh) is still working as a killer, under the influence of a powerful mind control serum. When she inhales an antidote and regains her free will, Yelena contacts her 'sister' and together they endeavour to kill Dreykov and destroy the Red Room, all the while avoiding deadly killing machine Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko).I don't know who Cate Shortland is, or how she got this plum directing gig (there's nothing in her resumé to suggest that she could handle a movie of this type), but she does a surprisingly good job, combining action, comedy, and drama to good effect, with a decent pace sustained throughout the two-and-a-quarter hour runtime. The performances are solid (although Winstone's Russian accent occasionally slips), with particularly good turns from Pugh (who makes amends for Midsommar) and Harbour (who provides much of the humour), the fight choreography and CGI is very impressive, and, perhaps most importantly, the film is a whole lot of fun, from the white-knuckle opening scene to the spectacular explosive final act."
38,5,"Bleh Widow I think there's a story here, one of studio interference, COVID, social politics, something. There has to be a reason why this movie exists, right? It doesn't really make any sense. We're getting a movie about a character that's... Well, yeah. It kind of reminds me of Rogue One, in a way. Both are movies that don't really need to be, we don't gain anything from their existence, they don't further the respective stories of their universes in any particularly meaningful way and neither of them has any stakes or anything to them. The difference being that I quite enjoyed Rogue One, while it didn't further the grand Star Wars epic, I felt like it added flavor to those lesser people in the galaxy struggling to make a difference. Black Widow doesn't do that in the slightest, the only thing it serves to do is hit us over the head with some really over the top lessons on sexism. Lessons which I will continue to say are needed but good lord if we could have any sort of subtlety or natural discourse rather than just ramming in these ridiculous forced narratives into things in ways that only ever feel awkward and contrived. The woman can be the hero fighting against oppression without making the man into Lucifer incarnate and/or a complete idiot.Anyhow, my rants on political agendas in film aside, I love that this movie introduces Florence Pugh to the MCU. She's amazing and I can't wait to see more from her, either in future Marvel properties or elsewhere... Although I am noticing this trend of not loving her movies but consistently loving her in them. Weird. Aside from her though, there's nothing to this. Its an inconsequential film that will likely be remembered more for the lawsuit around it than the film itself. I'd even go so far as to say, unless your a huge Marvel fan, you can skip this one altogether. It really brings nothing to the overall experience."
39,5,"Free from the library is OK. I'll pay more than five or six bucks for this is not.Had some good moments but there are far better superhero movies.I like the woman focus for a change, but several plot holes and General unbelievability, make this an middling superhero show."
40,6,"Stole the show Florence Pugh was fantastic in this movie. Overall the movie was good but not great, but Florence was amazing. Worth a watch. I think more could have been done with Scarlets character. For a super hero movie it hit the mark."
41,8,"Good mix humour and action Really good cast playing their parts well, (maybe a couple of dodgy Russian accents in there, but nothing worth getting hung up over). Thoroughly enjoyed this as a stand alone and also fits the MCU."
42,8,"Well made film Like the directors other films, this is a very well made superhero film. Different from other recent superhero films, concentrating on comedy and drama and a story instead. When the action scenes come they are interesting and entertaining. Well photographed and acted."
43,5,They could have done so much more. I was really excited for this story but was very dissapointed. I was bored watching this while I thought it would become my favourite marvel movie. The fight scene's were very impressive and Yelena an epic character. It doesn't compare to other Marvel movies in my opinion which is a shame.
44,7,"Black Widow origin story, just about works. The origin of Black Widow = Natasha Romanoff ( Scarlett Johansson ) maybe a bit late in the day for some, however meeting her sister Yelena Belova ( Florence Pugh ), father Alexei = Red Guardian/Crimson Dynamo ( David Harbour ) & mother Melina ( Rachel Weisz ) actually makes this movie very relevant as these are 3 ( new to Marvel film universe ) characters that could have very interesting futures in further films ( or on Disney+ TV ) so from that point of view there is a lot of positives to come from this movie.So why 7 out of 10 as I could watch this movie a few times potentially as it is well made & basically the flaws of the movie drag it down a bit however the main characters are interesting & I do want to see more as possible.So let's hope we can enjoy these characters as the actors are very good.Overall the script gets a bit too ridiculous at times while moving the story on, as you are not helped as an audience to ever believe all the heroes are really in danger of death ( they needed to shock the audience but didn't ) so that loses a star as if the heroes can't be killed where is the tension in the viewing that makes the audience stay on edge & raise the emotion why we watch, as the better directors & writers understand the need for jeopardy.The next star lost in this movie for me is the main bad guy you just don't hate enough as an audience even though he has done terrible things, as with so many bad characters turning good in other Marvel movies etc it is important when you get an Evil character you have to really make the audience to agree they need to be destroyed for the greater good or at least for a believable reason where the audience can fully emphasise with the heroes on what must be done & not enough time was devoted to making the audience really want to see the bad guy actually get his comeuppance.The last star lost for me in this movie was the missed opportunity for the characters in the movie to earn redemption, as they gloss over any bad things someone may have done ( either forced to do or by choice ) so what have the heroes actually overcome, as we needed a much better story arc for each character showing their journeys from either bad to good or vice versa & how they were learning to either do better next time or just give in to their inner demons & let their greed or inner demons drive them on.Directors & writers are too afraid to give us more complex characters but complex characters are what as an audience we find most interesting & yes ultimately we want to see them grow & change in time ( mostly for the better ) as it is the characters journeys that the audience want the most.The positive for me though is this movie has me very interested is seeing the characters Yelena, Alexei & Melina in other Marvel movies or TV shows on Disney+ ( hopefully they will give these characters much more story arcs & character development ). The actors did the best job they could do with this decent script however they can all do a lot more if given the chance."
45,1,This movie Stink Stank Stunk. One of the worst I have ever seen. This movie is terrible. It is boring. It makes no sense. It is extremely comic book cold war anti-Russian. Do not waste your time. I keep watching to see if it would turn itself around. Does not happen. Bad from first to last second.
46,2,"Lost Potential for a long awaited Black Widow Solo Film I will admit Black Widow is my favorite avenger, so I was pretty disappointed with this film.It took me 2 months to get through it because I truthfully couldn't watch it in one sitting.However, I really enjoyed Florence Pughs character ""Yelena."" and was happy to see her return in the Disney+ ""Hawkeye"" series.Sadly, you won't miss much if you skip this movie."
47,7,"Better late, than never? I don't know I enjoyed this movie enough. The action and fight scenes were all amazing, which was great to see. Otherwise, this movie has a bunch of flaws. The Taskmaster was really bad. All of the villains in this movie, were bad. The story itself was just a setup for Yelena's future in the MCU. Yelena was also really funny. The whole family was. Overall, I enjoy the comedy and action. The story and villains were not that great."
48,8,"""Never let them take your heart"" Well worth the wait, but would have loved this in the theatres. Cate Shortland was able to use the best parts of Bond, Bourne and Hunt to make this long overdue and constantly delayed solo outing for Black Widow kick-ass amazing. Expectations were as high as a floating facility in the skies over Russia, and it broke that glass."
49,4,"My least favourite Marvel film so far Black Widow, a film released in 2021 exclusively on Disney+ was received fairly well upon its announcement, and it was obvious that fans were excited for the standalone story of Natasha Romanoff. Initially I had no intentions of watching this film or even taking a sneak peek at it. Why, you ask? Well it startled me why a Black Widow film was necessary and in the process of production after the character's death in Avengers: Endgame, however quite a lot of source material including the new villain Taskmaster hadn't been adapted from the comics, so bringing these characters canon to the Marvel comics was a nice edition to the collection of an increasingly expanding cinematic universe.Going into this film with all honesty I was well-aware that the final reviews for this film and overall speculation wasn't at a high, but a significant low. So to make things simple I went into this film knowing it wasn't going to be a brilliant film, and I'm not sure whether that had an influence on my final opinion of the film but what I will express is that Black Widow is frustratingly disappointing, poor and all round, bad.The main outlook of this film is that it takes a very edgy approach, defining it as when a film tries too hard to be the above things, and as a result seems phony and embarrassing, and Black Widow follows this criteria to the letter. From the beginning scene of the Young Natasha miraculously flying a plane at 11 years old, to the uncertain Russian accent adopted by David Harbour and the wasted & forgettable characters, Black Widow shoves a multitude of dull plotlines and scenes into the audience's faces. First off, one of my most despised moments in the whole movie is the scene between Natasha and Yelena, their altercation as adults halted to a stop merely by yelling 'truce' is nothing but a stupid and irritating moment. It is especially aggravating when conflict between characters just comes to a brake-slam like stop, it's almost as if the film hypes things up for nothing. To build on a wasted plotline, characters such as Alexi are incredibly bland and were so undeveloped and littered with unnecessary and unfunny characteristics. For instance, moments of dialogue exchanged between himself and Natasha after the helicopter land, as well as Alexi being shot in the chest by multiple arrows. Is this film trying to be serious or is it truly what Scorsese refers to Marvel movies being 'theme rides'? It just doesn't seem to find that balance at all with this movie.The most obvious plothole in Black Widow is the uninteresting and disjointed third act. This is assisted with more disappointing action sequences, such as the twenty or so armed soldiers pointing their rifles at Melina, whereby she shoots the ceiling allowing it to crumble on all parts of the bridge except her. And guess what, she escapes!! Again, more examples of things that just didn't work out for reasons such as unoriginal ideas include Natasha being halted the second she tries to stab Dreykov and her sudden tweek of emotion when she is attacked by him, I've seen better stuff than this in far more superior and better critically acclaimed films such as The Dark Knight and Fight Club.To sandwich this review from top to bottom, it is difficult to pick out moments you appreciate when you aren't particularly enjoying the experience, however I can pick out broadly that the fact that Black Widow as a character is fairly simplistic, and doesn't go too overboard with the 'superpowers' that the other characters within the MCU possess. It was just a shame that this film had to cut through Natasha's childhood, as that would have been what I would have liked to see most.Although I am not a diehard fan of the MCU and highly anticipate that I never will be, my appreciation of these movies may have not been puzzled together due to some other MCU movies I simply cannot remember or haven't seen. However, to the degree that I do understand, I don't care. It was unfortunate that Black Widow turned out this way, and sadly further explanation to why this film is highly flawed I do not believe is necessary, I'll let you figure that one out for yourselves."
50,4,"Bring tissues An incredible send off for one of the world's most influential superheroes.It was well worth the wait.The soundtrack was top notch, the visuals were incredible, and the cast was phenomenal. I cannot recommend this enough.Without spoiling anything, all I can say is: This movie is amazing and Cate Shortland's directing shows it.Note: Bring tissues. I was tearing up already at the beginning during the opening credits."
51,9,"Well made with great message Excellent acting as always from the two female leads, with fun and intense interplay between the pseudo-family. Packed with action from beginning to end and a message of hope and perseverance at the end."
52,10,"Marvel movie with background story I am wondering where all the bad reviews are coming from. I found it interesting to know more about the background story of Blackwidow alias Natasha Romanoff. Like in every Marvel movie it had some pretty good jokes and humor in it. Thanks for the movie, can't wait for the second part."
53,8,"Black Widow At first, the movie was very boring, difficult to understand, but little by little I understood the story and I got excited about the movie, but it got more and more fun to watch.The Black Widow movie is a movie that has action from beginning to end, the performances are very good, the effects too.The fact of Widow's origin and how she's been trained forever is a cool movie, but there are times when we get bored."
54,9,"A great movie that came out at the wrong time I love this story for Natasha, it was a great balance of funny, full of action, and emotional. I wish that Captain Marvel had come out around the same time in the MCU as Doctor Strange and that this movie came out in between Infinity War and Endgame instead. It is a wonderful story and was one of the first MCU movies that really show Natasha as a full character instead of just the sexy one which is exactly what she deserves!"
55,5,"Poser Another Marvel movie that doesn't narrate the story of the main character but instead makes references about the other Marvel movies, past and future as well. The beginning is quite promising then everything falls into this deep rabbit hole that doesn't make sense anymore. Dialogues are confusing and the whole attempt on making everything funny, even on sensitive issues, is pure cringe. A whole milking the cow situation, imo, it's not worth the 2+ hours of watching. Black Widow's original story from the comics is great, it probably just needed some time adaptations but it would've made an amazing film. I'm definitely disappointed."
56,5,"It pains me to have to rate this movie this low Like it really really hurts my heart. I thought we were finally getting a movie about Natasha Romanoff. Maybe finally we get a proper send-off for her.We weren't and didn't, not in this film. I don't really know what the hell we got, aside from the introduction to Yelena Belova (who, is amazing and kick-ass and Florence Pugh is perfect as her, but my point still stands). The story is convoluted, to the extent there really is one, and I don't know, I guess if this had come out several years ago, maybe it would have been easier to forgive. But not at this point.Watching the Assembled episode for the film, it became even more apparent that there wasn't a coherent story in this film. It's fine to have a film be character-driven, but there still has to be a direction to go in. This was all over the place.Lastly, the CGI/VFX were so visible (and thus terrible) at one point I was shocked. This was not up to Marvel caliber.Black Widow deserved so much better. I was so sad that this movie turned out the way it did."
57,10,"amirhoseinahg To put it simply, ""The Black Widow"" is a typical spin-off of the Marvel movie world, heavily indebted to the spy action genre and well-known Hollywood works in the genre. In fact, we are on the side of a spy trailer like the Bourne movie series, Mission Impossible and even James Bond, which wants to combine a family drama comedy with the life story of a popular character like Natasha Romanov in Marvel's specific formula. Slowly With such descriptions, it will entertain you as long as you control your expectations. Otherwise, we are dealing with a very simple film that has a serious shake-up in the body of its story."
58,6,"I don't like spiders! Black Widow (2021)-This film felt like it was a small part of a much bigger story stretched out to fit film length. As if it should have been at the beginning of 'Avengers Assemble' (2012) to show Black Widow's origins as they had with the other characters, instead of lumped on at the end of the ""Infinity Stone"" story arc with no real purpose.And it still seemed like they didn't have faith in her on her own and I don't know why, because they made that terrible 'Captain Marvel' (2019) film and Widow is a much more interesting and likeable character, played by a much better actress, as well as an established character with history to build on (I know that there is a catalogue of comics with information too).However, in this film, for some reason, the producers felt the need for this strong independent woman, famous for working best on her own and renowned on film, so far, for her singular past, to be furnished with a family.As such it didn't really feel like it was her own origin story as much as a ""What I did on my holidays"" essay to explain what she got up to while she was on the run after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016).In fact, all they did was refer to ""The Avengers"" all the time, suggesting to us that she was nothing without a team behind her. It wasn't their film!It might have actually worked better if she was sending a message to Steve Rogers to get her actions off of her chest, if only they were worth talking about. Just at the start or the end to indicate where it stood in the timeline more clearly and get the ""Avengers"" part out of the way.If there had been more about her origins it would have been good too, as that was all very quickly swept over. That's what the fans all wanted to see anyway from this film, but it was a bit half hearted.Instead, we got a filler film with only hints of her past, as a way to introduce new characters and set up the 'Hawkeye' (2022) series and a potential replacement for her in future Avengers productions.If it hadn't been a film about an existing character and hadn't been set in the Marvel universe that we have already invested in, it might have been a good film in its own right, like a 'Bourne Identity' (2002) or something but as a follow up to 'Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame' (2018/19) it fell quite flat.That is to say that it IS a good film, but it just doesn't have the wow that Scarlett as The Widow or the fans deserved or enough oomph to come after the other much more epic adventure.I actually rate Scarlett really highly and think that she is underrated along with her character. Let's hope that they find a way to bring her back in future instalments and give her a script worthy of her excellence.As for the supporting actors, I found them acceptable, but not outstanding.I usually love Rachel Weisz, but found her a bit flat too and Ray's accent was patchy at best and I can only imagine that they used David Harbour to try and bring in the 'Stranger Things' audience. He was a bit too comedic for me and unnecessarily so, like 'Fat Thor' in Endgame.It's definitely watchable and my comments are harsh, but we have come to expect better from Marvel, it's not DC after all. I hope this isn't an example of what Disney is going to do with the franchise going forward.615.22/1000."
59,6,"VISUALLY STUNNING The cinematography and production design was on-point. Although, everything else was ""okay"" it still was enough to put the film in a slightly higher rank compared to its contemporaries. I just felt that the comedic antics were a bit corny and unnecessary."
60,6,"Quite bad really Considering the franchise its connected with, this really wasn't that good.The storyline was very Winter Soldier and the horrendous accents made me feel sick.There were some humorous moments, but not enough to hide the fact that this film was a one time watcher.Merely watch it to keep up with the official Avengers timeline, but once you've watched it, never ever watch it again."
61,5,"Pretty weak... Is it just me , or any new entry into the superheroes franchises getting less and less interesting and engaging? Story is weak , action is generic , acting is subpar...Me no likie much )"
62,9,"Highly underrated I can only assume the pandemic ruined whatever chance this entry to the MCU had of succeeding, but I think it deserves a much better review than it's received. Having seen every other Marvel movie, this is easily better than half of them (although a bit longer than needed). I only hope we get to see more of Yelena and Red Guardian in the future!"
63,1,"You have to watch it to believe it The stupidity and tacked-on virtue signalling is on another level with this one. The on-the-nose (pun intended) pandering makes this film a chore to watch, which made me a bit sad, because I felt that Natasha Romanoff had deserved a much better film than this audacity.In which has to be the worst Marvel movie of all time, Black Widow not only discovers that she's nothing special, she also has to fight an old white man in a castle in the clouds, the ultimate patriarch, the manifestation of the enemy of the third wave.This man, you see, is a crazy evil mysoginist who calls girls the ""one natural resource the world has too much of"". Yes, he actually says that in the film. And who would be more fitting to manipulate into being his physically superior, invincible brutes than girls, right?But wait a second, you might interject, how does he stop them from killing him? With a microchip in their brains? With clever blackmail? No. He does it with pheromones, and I wish I was making this up. And that's why not even Natasha can kill him initially, until she breaks her own nose in what has to be the most ridiculous scene ever put to film. Get it? Nose broken, no more smelling you, haha. Why didn't you use a gun? I have no idea, and neither did the writers of this stupidity.And as usually, every man is ridiculous and incompetent, except for the diverse guy who gets stuff for her. He's a nice guy. An ally, you know?I feel genuinely sorry for Scarlett Johansson. Nobody deserves such an atrocity, especially not one of the finest actors of the MCU, and it's really hard to believe how pathetically Disney tries to pander to ""younger audiences"" with ""modern sensibilities"", sacrificing good story-telling, characters and authenticity for another display of their fake morals. Ask poor John Boyega."
64,10,Entertaining! Little different approach as per continuation of journey and backstory together. The overall runtime was entertaining action scenes were awesome and the story-line was decent! It was a decently entertaining movie!
65,4,"Like a parody of a Marvel movie. There's just so much ridiculous garbage happening, I couldn't maintain suspension of disbelief.The car crashes in the subway station where you just happen to have a secret hidey-hole in the ceiling?Black widow and another super-hero looking assassin walk into a convenience store, and the girl starts making fun of the avengers pose: the clerk doesn't bother to look up.Forced backstory to try to make this garbage into something with genuine emotional drama just felt tedious.There are 3 types of movies: Good ones: that are both entertaining but poses some genuine artistic substance.Bad ones, which may still be fun, but which are just cotton candy... sweet fluff with out any real substance.The worst ones: Bad ones trying too hard to be good ones.This was the third category... really, just not good. Not important, not impressive, not emotionally engaging nor stimulating.I'm not sure if it is the worst... but it might be. Even Thor Dark works introduced an infinity stone and justified it's existence a bit.This is literally a prequel to a sequel: a disposable waste of everyone's time."
66,7,"Good! Overall I enjoyed this Black Widow film. I thought the first two-thirds of the film was good. It wasn't until the third act where it lost me a little. The fight scenes were great! The Taskmaster and Natasha fight on the bridge, the kitchen fight with Yelena & Natasha, and the prison breakout scenes are all highlights for me. I personally really enjoyed those fight sequences and scenes as a whole. Where the film faults would be its villain and the taskmaster twist. It didn't really stick its landing there. But where the movie shines is the action sequences I previously mentioned but also YELENA. She was the real highlight of the film. Awesome character and perfect portrayal by the brilliant Florence Pugh. Another great casting job by Marvel Studios."
67,8,"Well done again. I had a lot of fun watching it, is a well done movie. Is not a materpiece, is not something you will remember in the next 50 years, but is definitelly a fun movie.Actors performed well, the real revelation is Yelena (Florence Pugh) who did an amazing job. David Harbor as the Red Guardian had some really funny lines that I enjoyed.Well done Marvel, well done ..."
68,4,"Meh. Not really a movie anyone wanted. At least, we wanted it in like 2014. Anywits. It's dull & all the things that could be fun or interesting about it just feel like onanistic fan service."
69,5,Not what I was expecting I don't know just something was off. I'm watching all the marvel movies in order on Disney + for the first time and I got to this movie and it just was off. I was excited to watch it for the first time and I wanted it to be good because I really like how Scarlett Johansson has been throughout this whole series and she finally got her solo movie but it just did nothing for me compared to the other movies.
70,5,"Worse than Thor The Dark World I liked three things in this movie. Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh and David Harbour. There's not more good things. And I want to ask that; ""Why no blood? Where is blood?"" I know it's PG-13 but there's not even one drop."
71,6,"A refreshing breather after the events of Avengers: Endgame What's the best way to handle a movie where the lead character has already died in a previous film? Why should audiences care about the stakes when we've already seen some form of resolution? Black Widow as a film is a slippery story to shoehorn into an interconnected universe where the narrative is mostly moving forward, not stopping to give pause for past adventures. Some could say this circumstance is of Marvel Studio's (read: Ike Perlmutter) own doing: had we gotten a Black Widow film sooner, it can be almost conclusively agreed on that the story would've hit in a different way. While the movie serves to fill a gap of time between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, there's still some odd decisions made in the telling of the story, especially in the final scenes. Bracketed by scenes featuring the seemingly ever-present Secretary of State General Thunderbolt Ross, Black Widow is a story firmly centered on Marvel's second greatest spy: Natasha Romanoff. After being contacted by Yelena Belova, another product of the same Red Room we get glimpses of in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Natasha must simultaneously flee capture at the hands of Ross while working to bring down the establishment that made her.At its core, Black Widow shares most of its DNA with the other spy thriller in the MCU, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (which also stars Johansson). No world-ending event, no invading aliens, no angry gods to be smote in this film, just some good old fashioned bad guys: Black Widow is a pure action spectacle from beginning to end. Incredible chase scenes, strong character work, and a bit of clever storytelling make this one of the stronger entries into the overall MCU canon.With this likely being her swan song in the MCU, Scarlett Johansson brings her best portrayal to the character ever. With almost a decade of time and numerous appearances large and small to hone and perfect the character, Black Widow has her at her most locked in and nailed down. As Johansson is easily one of the finest actors within the MCU stable (she was nominated for an Oscar twice in the same year, a rare feat), she's finally given the opportunity to shine as the lead, handling the weightier moments of the film. Conversely, Florence Pugh's first entry into the universe lands her a huge splash as audiences are introduced to Yelena Belova, another member of the infamous Red Room. While Pugh's Belova doesn't quite have the same amount of screen time as Natasha has, it's clear that part of the purpose of this movie was to introduce Belova as a potential ally/foil for another character later on down the road. While some are upset that Johansson has to share large chunks of the screen with her replacement in her final film, the interactions between the two are some of the most enjoyable moments of the movie. Belova is used to remind Johansson not just of who she used to be, but what she's become and how far she's progressed. Rachael Weiss and David Harbour as Natasha and Yelena's parental figures each get a little time to shine on their own as well.Unfortunately, Black Widow falls into the same trap as some Phase 1 and Phase 2 MCU movies did of having a weak villain. Ray Winstone's Dreykov, head of the Red Room isn't revealed until late in the second act and when he is, there's little about him that sets him up to be a worthy adversary for Natasha; in the end he's mostly all talk and swagger and easily dispatched of, similar to Iron Man's Obadiah Stane or Ant-Man's Darren Cross. Possibly the largest disappointment of the film was the lack of Taskmaster doing what audiences came to see the character do: kick ass. As one of Marvel Comic's beloved lesser-known villains, Taskmaster's ability to mimic any movement that results in Natasha having to basically fight any possible combination of her Avengers teammates is a concept that falls flat of being fully explored. While the character is a fun watch in the action scenes we get, the possibility of getting some real juicy stunts featuring the moves of heroes we've come to love seemed to be chopped, perhaps due to trimming down the runtime.Director Cate Shortland has become yet another in the staple of MCU directors either plucked from obscurity (Chloe Zhao's name did not have the heat it does now when Eternals was announced) or a complete surprise (""the guys who did Community?""). Even more incredulous, each one of her three previous full feature length films failed to recoup their production budget, making her nomination to helm a long-awaited film set in an unprecedented box office bonanza franchise one of the riskiest decisions Disney and Marvel Studios have made yet. Shortland's direction on Black Widow is nothing short of top notch. Beautiful imagery, meticulously planned action scenes, and character work both subtle and overt all weave together to make the 134 minute runtime feel like a fun breeze. The assignment to give Natasha a good sendoff as well as introduce Yelena Belova into the overall world was a tricky task to handle and Shortland delivers. The interactions between Romanoff and Belova are believable and heartfelt and the underlying theme of a family strongest when together isn't preachy or heavy-handed. Amazing cinematography from Germain McMicking includes both dazzling shot compositions as well as chaotic action that's still easy for the audience's eye to follow. Great editing which leads to a good pace for the film keeps viewers interested and invested throughout.Overall, Black Widow stands apart as one of the finest standalone movies within the MCU. While this only increases the frustrations of previous year's wondering what took us so long to get it, the film was well worth the weight. Dynamic action setpieces, strong acting, and sure, confident directing from Shortland combine to create the feeling of an old school spy thriller set within the superhero universe. While Black Widow has no overall earth-shattering impact on future events of the MCU (that we know of yet), it still serves as a refreshing breather after the events of Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Even with the elements that don't fully work, the overall enjoyment of having an MCU flick back on the big screen and the pleasure of hearing the flipping pages over the opening fanfare herald a return to form for the juggernaut that dominated our theaters for a decade. If this truly is Scarlett Johansson's final performance as Natasha Romanoff the Black Widow, the character went out on an explosive high note that is sure to delight audiences the world over. Black Widow is in theaters July 9th."
72,5,The point of the movie doesn't revolve around Black Widow. I went in not having seen the trailer so maybe it's my fault for expecting to see Black Widow's origin story. She 100% deserves one and this falls flat. It takes place between a couple past movies and I had a hard time keeping the timeline straight at first. I honestly didn't understand the point to this movie as I was watching. It felt like a filler. Only at the end did I realize the whole point was probably to introduce another character who is hinted at becoming a more important character in later MCU movies. They really didn't do Black Widow any justice. Hopefully she gets a better movie in the future.
73,2,"Save Your Money What a total disappointment. Yes, there are great action scenes and the acting is good, however, the plot and storyline and script are worse than bad. This movie had a very bizarre beginning and then nothing pieces together after that. No one in our house had a clue what was going on. I am not a writer but am very confident that I could have written something much better than this. This is poor storytelling."
74,5,Hollywood klyukva Pointless cash-grab movie with no impact on Marvel Universe except the Russian side which was stupidly depicted with all typical Russian cliches. There's always vodka - no Russian character can be on screen with no vodka. Family dynamic itself is weak and don't make much sense. The worst part we know that Black Widow is goner anyway and her character arc doesn't do anything to the story and our perception.
75,4,"disappointing.. It's not so much that this is bad film it's more just the timing of witch it came out. This movie came out after end game,infinity war,Loki,wandavison and a bunch of other films focusing more on the universal expect of the mcu. While this film is just bounded to earth. They also really hyped the idea of a ""black window"" movie for the longest time and this was just such a disappointment. I have to say the first 20 minutes of this film are amazing one of the best openings to any mcu film."
76,6,"Poser Following the events of Captain America: Civil War, Natasha(Scarlett Johansson) is now a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords. Meanwhile in Morocco her sister Yelena Belova(Florence Pugh) still a red room black widow kills a rogue widow, but comes in contact with a gas that neutralizes the Red Room's mind-control. She seeks out Natasha to tell her that the red room is still active and it's leader Antonia Dreykov is still alive. The must confront their past and destroy the red room. The films a decent attempt at a solo film. While at the same it's was as huge mistake on Disney part.many of the scenes involving her family are entertaining and investing with their bickering. The red guardian(David Harbour) as sort of this wash up dead beat father figure is more part of the comedic side of the Film. He's a Russian Captain America reject who feels that he never got his big shot and was thrown away by his country. You feel for him but at the same time you can't help but laugh at the same time at his performance. Along with Florence as Yelena is not as classy as Natasha she drinks, swear and even pokes fun at Nastsha being a Poser. How they bicker back and forth between one another shows that they truly are sisters. Although is pretty funny. Rachel Weisz is also good as their mother figure Melina,but she's not really all that relevant until much later. The Head of the red room honestly a let down while the idea they try to go with is more of a intellectual and psychological villian you don't see any real threat it more of want he represents and if they were to go more darker and deep into Natasha past then it would seem more impact. The movie doesn't really show her time in the red room. It just more only talked about. Natasha honestly take a backseat to Yelena, She feels sorry for herself the whole time, but you don't really feel the same way as you should. Her one scene with Bruce in age of ultron seemed more impactful. That's clearly what their trying to go for is emotion as opposed to action packed while there are actions in the film it's not that much of it it's more meant to be centered around the characters. The movie's overall generic people kept asking and demanding for a black window movie, but the studio didn't wanna do anything because they didn't think it would've been profitable. However so much time has pass to the point that stigma for Nastsha's just gone now. It's way too late to actually feel the same way. If it came out three or five years ago not as many people would've been burned out by the idea of it. *Spoilers*The biggest major issue that fans will have with this movie is the taskmaster and how essentially the taskmaster here is really not like the comic counterpart. The Taskmaster is a woman has connections to Dreykov doesn't really have a personality, more of mindless brute that just follows orders with a computer chip Embedded in her neck to scan movements not having the photographic reflexes & Memory. It was a really uncalled for and unnecessary change that add to nothing, this would have been the perfect opponent for Natasha face throughout the entire film. Also why would Dreykov have vial of this mind canceling gas in his hideout. The end credits hinting of Yelena going after Hawkeye doesn't mean anything because your telling me that she and the whole world wouldn't know what actually happened to Natasha. That all the heroes wouldn't have told of the sacrifice she made along with tony and Steve."
77,4,"Black Spider ""Black Widow"" is just a miracle of miracles! Much more long-awaited than Zack Snyder's Justice League, a project that was supposed to come out with about the same insignificant probability - when all the crayfish on the mountain will whistle after the rain on Thursday. This movie was requested after the first ""Avengers"". Yes, what was asked - demanded! As a result, Marvel Studios was honored to make a solo album about Natasha Romanoff only after her death in the canon of the film universe. However, this event had to be postponed for more than a year - the coronavirus, the dog. So true fans really suffered, but still got their movie about a former Russian spy, a former Avengers agent and a former sex symbol of the Marvel universe. The former, because the actress and her character refused all these honorary titles.To understand where the film's legs are growing from, let's go back in time for a while, to the time of the tape ""The First Avenger: Confrontation"". Cap throws the Avengers for Bucky, and Natasha takes his side. Now he's."
78,8,"Good Black Widow is about 7-8 years overdue as this should've happened post-winter soldier era MCU to me however, that doesn't diminish this film as a solid entry in a 25+ film saga and certainly one Scarlett Johansson deserved as a proper send off. Funny, action packed when it needs to be, and rewatchable Black Widow made it's mark on the genre this summer. I wish it would've done better at the box office."
79,7,"Pain only hardens us US President Joe Biden has just complained that Russia, its leadership, has a big problem. Consisting of two incarnations: the first is that the Russian Federation has nuclear weapons. Secondly, Russia has oil. And that's it. There is nothing else, they say, in Russia.And here, and did not guess! We still have something. Third, according to Hollywood. ""Black Widows"", which have a control center in the Red Room, of course.The pandemic is sweeping across new territories. The Marvel Universe also went into quarantine for a couple of years and came out with the Black Widow movie. After watching this movie, it seemed to me that the authors, albeit indirectly, suffered from the epidemic. I haven't seen such wild dialogue, old-fashioned Cold War clichés and illogical, incoherent script in a long time.To be honest, it seemed to me when watching that the director was frankly joking over the material. Along with the actors. And they all neigh at the same time, interspersing laughter with drinking Russian vodka and stronger expressions in Russian from the cycle: ""well, we did this!"" And then comes the word. Blin type. Yes, the ""pancake"" under the label ""Black Widows"" came out expensive on the budget, 200 million Baku dollars, but rotten, I would say.The Russians are at the center of the action. Natasha Romanoff and Lena Belova are the daughters of sleeping Russian agents in Ohio. A direct reference to the series ""The Americans"", by the way. Girls and agents slept and slept there, doing their espionage business until thunder struck. Thunder for 21 years, as a result, Natasha retired, and her sister Lena (Florence Pugh) moonlights as a contract killer: she stole a certain gas that neutralizes the suppression of the will of the ""black widows"", and for the betrayal of the villain Drakes (Ray Winston) in every possible way spread rot in the Moroccan gateways. After all, under her skin, as usual, she has a ""beacon"" sewn in and a bunch of killers, a female squad of ""erasers"", rush after her.The basis of the film was again the famous comics from Marvel's Black Widow series. All over the world, Russian villains in the person of General Drekov steal innocent girls, put inhuman experiments on them to subdue their will and train them to become death machines. Dropout is crazy! Like at a competition at VGIK. Natasha Romanoff also has some genetic connection to this army of ""black widows"".Adoptive parents Melina (Rachel Wise) and Alexei (David Harbor) with their daughters all together formed a once sweet American-Russian family. Yes, the family was based on a lie, a legend. But Russians are Russians. Therefore, the showdown between the sisters is in Russian.With knives clasped in her sister's delicate hand to open her elder's artery. Or Natasha, as the eldest, strangles the youngest with expensive curtains, thereby wanting to show her ardent love. Both in Russian enthusiastically throw each other into furniture sets, breaking them into chips. Then they all sit down at once and drink vodka. Everything goes with the normal course of the Russian piston: once Mama Melina reminded the girls: rejoice in broken knees, folded noses, broken limbs. ""Any pain makes you stronger.""There are a lot of clichés in Black Widow, no, a lot. Against the background of how the Russians are shown in the Netflix hit ""Korolev's Move"", it even seems that these are completely different states filming films in different decades. According to The Widow, we still have the Party of Lenin. And Karl Marx is our helmsman. All Russians are ""red"". We have red rooms. Red suits of the Red Guardian, he is the real ""red dad"". As usual, he is proud that his daughters organize explosions, coups in states, cut all sorts of riffraff right and left, and their thin elbows are covered in blood. Yes, and the names of part of the family in the manner of Smirnoff vodka."
80,6,"Such a poser Universe that has some decent cinematic moments, good character work, but also some key elements that let it down.I liked the basic plot and character arcs, which are set up well by a brilliant opening sequence, highly reminiscent of 'The Americans'. After that I think it gets a bit stop-start and hit-miss. Also, some scenes feel a bit too close to movies like Bourne and Kill Bill at times.I like the dynamic between Natasha and Yelena. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh have excellent chemistry and both give strong performances. It takes a lot to rival Johansson's presence, but Pugh certainly shares the stage with strong charisma. There are some great feminist themes, plus other allegories about the oppression of freedom, with the two lead characters plus others written well to translate them on screen."
81,1,"no Black Widow is a blend of spy thriller, superhero action and family drama. With the usual Marvel irony that shades Natasha Romanoff's serious facial expression and with the usual Phase IV movie-universe psychotherapy at the core of the whole jumble of genres.To say that in two hours with a tail, the authors managed to go through thriller, action and melodrama with equal dignity, is impossible. The intrigue of the next plot twist, the impenetrability of the rival's face and the tense routine inherent in spy movies dissolve here by the 20th minute, remaining a tick in the scriptwriter's checklist. What at first slightly resembled the last and best episodes of Mission Impossible ended up turning out to be not the most successful James Bond movies (which the guys make no secret of, in one scene turning on 1979's Moonraker on TV)But what definitely worked out was a family drama with a mind-clearing psychotherapeutic outcome. Kevin Feigy and company generally decided to build at least the first installment of Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on it. The release of Black Widow before the TV series would not have played in its favor. Too much here is turned to the past and as a Phase Four launch the picture would have looked awkward. Therefore, the pandemic in the case of Shortland's film was a plus: we see a cheerful, avoiding excessive sentimentality and a farewell to a heroine who has long been an auxiliary unit, which came at the right time."
82,3,"Weak Weak. In my opinion, this film should have been released much earlier. Right now this movie does absolutely nothing for us except for one character. It's sad, because showing us other events would have turned out better, and this is how Nick Fury's eye turned out."
83,2,"Farce Farce and absurdity mixed with cranberries, only occasionally diluted with jokes that can hardly be called successful, and often meaningless battles. The Russians in the film are worse than the Nazis, everything moves predictably in the spirit of the Russophobic ""Red Sparrows"" and ""Solov"" - Russian sadists, Russian criminals, Russian alcoholics ... Although from the solo album about ""Russian"" (""Romanov"" is my ass ...) a traitor would be stupid."
84,8,"Ride on ""Soloviev Air"" - suits: junk, but fun Let's start with a simple fact: the movie, which was postponed for over a year, finally, albeit with the help of Disney +, finally made it to the big screens! And then there is the highest-grossing line in the history of the planet - in general, a must-have, we all run to buy tickets, sweeping away like vodka and bears in stores with coupons at a time when the Red Guard (or the Red Army man!) Defended the borders of the Communist Party.Briefly describe the film, then ""Black Widow"" is definitely in the top list of the entire Marvel line, because even if you show just a black screen for two hours, it will already be better than ""The First Avenger"", ""Age of Ultron"", Wakanda, "" Captain Marvel ""and a good half of other legendary films of the great line. Here at least there is some kind of humor seasoned with cheerful cranberries, a tolerable, albeit very banal, plot and, in general, a popcorn picture made not on serious soups."
85,8,"Widow for wisdom Have you seen a story about the coolest of the Avengers? Don't think so? Well, here it is!This hero is a woman - a powerful woman, who seeks for equity and justice. She was a kid, that never knew her destiny was scheduled since her birth.The film is very interesting and won't leave you indifferent towards the character."
86,8,"Black Widow There are a lot of questions, and the usual story is that after the helicopter crash, or after the car turned over several times, or after the car EXPLODED - they don't care about anything. No fractures, no blood, no bruises all over the body. Yes, after her sister threw her on the wall several times, she could not get up for a long time... But still the movie is not bad, the most important thing is to go with friends, watch."
87,4,"Boring, drawn out, uninteresting, stupid Boring, drawn out, uninteresting, stupid, illogical and hacky. Now such a combination is difficult to achieve in modern big-budget blockbusters, including in the Marvel cinematic universe. They, as a rule, convey their entertainment purpose to the viewer.And I wouldn't say a word about elementary logic and the laws of physics if we were talking about another superhero with superpowers, a la Cap, who is really able to fall from a great height and grab the railing without dislocating his limb. But when an ordinary person does it, which is a Black Widow, it doesn't seem funny to me, it disappoints me. An entertainment product is a necessary thing, but it should also have at least basic logic.After watching it, it seemed that Marvel owed someone and finally paid off the debt. Without involvement, without enthusiasm, reluctantly. It's like plugging a hole in a product line to fulfill a plan, nothing more."
88,9,"Good The refreshingly straightforward plot is enlivened by sharp, internal flashbacks, as well as superbly staged episodes of hand-to-hand combat and chase. This makes the film look more like a ripping female entry into the Bourne or Bond franchises. The variety of locations is strikingly deployed to add visual textures, while Shortland does not celebrate violence and does not allow quieter scenes to become frivolous, instead adding dramatic undercurrents and backstories that carefully emphasize the tension between this fractured fake family. It also allows the cast to bring the audience much closer. As always with this character, Johansson combines outrageous physicality with a dark sense of authority, turning an effective killer into someone we like to root for. Her interaction with Pew is amazing, regardless of whether they are fighting with their fists or fighting with tears. And their witty banter is perfectly measured, for example, when Elena teases."
89,9,"War with a Woman's Face: Black Widow Movie Review To a cover of Smells Teen Like Spirit, the credits stylishly and briefly introduce the audience to the genesis of Natasha, not just a Soviet-educated operative, but a girl who has suffered enormous psychological damage and has known virtually no concept of family or warmth. Widows in the Marvel world face an unenviable fate: they are programmed to kill, made guinea pigs, self-destructing if they fail their missions, controlled by the megalomaniacal central antagonist Drake (Ray Winston). Natasha managed to escape, the others, including Elena, were not lucky at all. In the best traditions of the Jason Bourne trilogy, the action drags and unravels, pulsating and gaining momentum, which Marvel's solo films have previously had very little of."
90,8,"good but not very good Well, Black Widow is finally out! Did you succeed? It seems like yes, but if you consider it as a spy thriller, do not pay attention to some jambs in the plot. And so, it is possible to get pleasure, especially for lovers of action and adventure. Purely the film does not try to draw into what is happening, just turn off the brain and welcome to the world of industrial spy entourage, a kind of James Bond, only a female plan. The character Elena Belova, in fact, holds the film in her fist, she drags more.But honestly, the film caused me very controversial feelings, my expectations were higher. A very disposable movie that you are unlikely to want to watch again."
91,6,"not everything is so clear After watching it, it's hard to get rid of the feeling that The Widow was released too early and too late at the same time. Attempts to film Romanoff have been delayed several times. In 2006, high competition prevented: then the fashion for spy action movies with women in the lead roles just went. In 2016, Kevin Feige did not include the project in the next release schedule, concentrating on other films (including solo ones). Studios delayed the release of the picture right up to the Fourth Phase of the MCU. And Natasha Romanoff from the events of Avengers: Endgame (that is, even from the Third Phase) is considered dead.In 2020, the Disney+ streaming service opened, for which they prepared a whole line of superhero series, including WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Loki. The crimes of General Dreykov, the fate of the victims of the Red Room, the cooperation of Hydra and the Soviet authorities, the adventures of the Black Widow in Budapest - all this would be enough for a full-fledged Black Widow show, which viewers are unlikely to see."
92,7,"Didn't live up to expectations I haven't seen any of the Marvel movies. That is, I have no idea about Thor, the Avengers, and so on. Black Widow is my first introduction to the Marvel universe.I liked it in principle, but based on the trailer for the film, I expected more. The special effects, acting and story are top notch. The film tells about the formation of the Black Widow, about her childhood, as well as the Red Room, in which the training and education of Widows takes place. The plot is gripping, there were some sweet little jokes.But despite all the pluses, I still had mixed feelings after watching. I recommend this movie to Avengers fans.Thank you for reading my review."
93,8,"Blackwidow needs to be alone Visually exciting, yet the story drags in too many sentimental cutesy characters that distract the super soldiers need to be cold and unfeeling. Imagine this film with out the family fluff and one would have a strong story of good versus evil. Instead it gets lost in family drama."
94,8,"The Cast are on Point. The actors casted have proved, once again, the wodner of marvel casting. I cant imagine Yelena if she isnt Pugh, the sass is unbelievable. And the other actor also on point. Could not hope for better cast.The story suprisingly light, I expected its full of action, very serious, and almost boring.But it is actually light, funny, and even relatable. The jokes and the feelings perfectly fit with the flows.Im enjoying the movie very much. I could watch 4 hours of this movie and not getting bored."
95,1,"A TERRIBLE SECOND VIEW EXPERIENCE Was absolutely painful to watch it second time. Where to start from... Every single character's move, line and story twist-n-turn was annoyingly predictable than ever. So unpleasantly unsurprising. Acting was tagged, a total cliché. Not a single try or aiming to be more original than the first viewing, means no creativity. The humor was irritating. The action scenes were less exciting than watching a parody of Swan Lake at the local school. Camera work, if there was anything like ""work"", felt like they have tied up a half broken camera on a limping mule's back, and have left. Editing is most atrocious: shot transitions felt long, even and boring, seems they've forgot to buy themselves a watch. Sequences have lost every meaning in the world they might have had in the first place. The soundtrack couldn't have been more inappropriate and insipid. ..... Expecting to like it? Don't watch it twice. Not even once."
96,6,"Jason Bourne in the MCU Okay, the header of my review is a bit harsh. But basically that's what Black Widow is. It further explores the background of Black Widow, one the earliest and most human of the Avengers. And since this character is an ass-kicking former spy with a murky past, comparison with the Bourne franchise is quickly made. Except that this is a MCU superhero film and therefore the action setpieces are totally over the top and somehow doesn't really suit the basic material. The interesting parts of the film are the more realistic scenes where we get to know Romanoff's past and some more down to earth fight scenes (and not the overblown finale). Johansson does a solid job but it are newcomers Pugh and Harbour that steal the show. It all does feel a bit ""haven't we seen this before"" and particularly after such a great ending of MCU's phase 3 feels like an extra dessert you didn't order."
97,3,Special effects are terrible Very bad special effects. To the point it all looks super fake. Crazy. I think this movie js way overrated.Not really worth it. Unless you want to play it for a 5 year old.
98,6,"Good story, nice action sequences with a few lacks here and there It was refreshing to see an action movie without much of a CGI enemy battle. The sister twist story was well played and did not push too far on the reunification side so the movie was able to start pretty quick. The prison sequence was quite long and useless to my opinion, nothing fun to watch there.Some of the plot twists have also been well shown with some slight hint of surprise. I just hate the long monologues and useless battles such as Black Widow against a bunch of other widows, receiving that many hits, I'd be on the ground without moving anymore and with a blown nose, unable to fight too. As I said in my Shang-Chi review, having a sens of inner strength battle is a good thing but the females seem way too overpowered for simple human beings.We also have no real clue about what is happening between Black Widow and Shield and we have no real answer to it. Even if the answer is maybe in previous movies, a refresher would have been nice because there is no explanation to the final scene and movie with an ending sequence unexplainable to me is worth at least 2 good stars off knowing that this is Marvel. It's also quite boring to see all of the heros fail miserably in their combats with barely a small scratch and lumping from one leg. The movie misses the feeling of hero satisfaction and story fulfillment and leaves us with a sens of Good action but I don't mind not following the story, the movie is just a movie.Enjoyable, fun to watch ---- ONCE!"
99,9,Enjoyed! Nice action with few twists. It is enjoyable movie with a lot of action and sense of humour. Messages about family ties were touching through out the film. Family has a dinamic together and they were so much fun to watch. Alexei Shostakov was so funny which was not expected but so mucH enjoyable. Credit scene is a bit sad though. I like Scarlet Yohansson and I wish to see her on Marvel movies forever.
100,8,"A Tribute (...not a Hunger Games one either) Unless you've been living under a rock for the last twenty years, you'd have noticed there's this genre in movies thanks entirely to the late, great Stan Lee: the Marvel Cinematic Universe.It is upon this genre that Mr Lee was able to so creatively weave together story-lines between his different superhero characters.In the midst of one particular Marvel timeline we have The Avengers; and consequently we got to witness one Natasha Romanova (aka Black Widow).It was with great sadness we witnessed her demise in The Infinity War series; that's where this movie likely met its inception.Inevitably, because Black Widow was inevitably a MCU fan favorite, this movie sorta had to be made.As a prequel like film, it takes a snapshot into a time in Black Widow's past life, and along the way we are introduced to her enigmatic family.(It's at this point that fastidious, pompous and self-righteous MCU fanatics lose their rag at just how incongruous this movie is with their OCD/PTSD(?) ravaged minds. Because, of course, only their view of how MCU movies ""should be made"" ever really count for anything.{Back to normal programming}I won't go into further detail about the movie, as i'm sure there are people who are straddling the proverbial fence on whether or not they'll actually watch the movie.To the latter point (i.e. Contemplation on viewing), i highly recommend that you most certainly do. As to why? This is a tribute Black Widow deserved - and the character many MCU fans came to love (myself included) did meet with an untimely demise, so she most assuredly deserved a send off on this raucous, wild scale. To that end, the direction, screenplay, dialogue and story line (mostly) achieved that goal.Oh, one last point: it has to be reinforced that this movie is a snapshot into Black Widow's past lives; weaving it into a tapestry that gives viewers a better understanding of the person behind Black Widow - i'm quite sure the director didn't intend it to be a biographical (so, tough titties, OCD/PTSD types if it didn't meet your exacting standards on that front).And so here is the curtain call for that spectacular chanteuse. Fare thee well, Black Widow, i fear we shall not see the likes of such a bad-ass maiden ever again."
101,5,"One of the poorer Marvel films but worth a watch. A film that had a lot of hype turned out to be average at best. The film started well but goes down hill after 20 mins. The constant need to mention that Natasha is an Avenger becomes irritating. Unless you have been living under a rock, we know she is. The attempts at Russian accidents, whilst trying to keep in the theme of Russian spies etc, aren't great. The action scenes aren't exciting enough and don't reach the same heights of other marvel films. The film overall is worth a watch, if you like your Marvel films and don't want to miss a film in the Marvel Universe."
102,8,"Way better than expected It is dark and not family-friendly all the time, but the acting, the dialogue was convincing, the humor worked and the action sequences/choreography were/was great. One of the movies were the mostly female brawls didn't remind me of a ""girls fight"". Definitely one to watch."
103,9,Emotional movie The movie has a good plot and it´s visually really good looking. The movie is quite emotional and brutal. It also makes the movie more sad if you have seen avengers end game and know what happends to Natasha. The movie shows the strong and the vulnerable side of the characters. The fighting scenes are good and the movie also has some comical moments. I personally recommend.
104,7,"Good enough Movie takes place after events of civil war and a partial origin story.The story is ok, alot of things are not explained which I like, but there is some plot holes that are never addressed.The acting is good, although Im not impressed with Scarlett Johansson in this.The effects are good, but alot of cgi in the later half feels off.How strong is everyone in this movie? Just seems strange at times.One of the funnier moments is the posing gimmick, I always thought black widow's character looked dumb in the original movies when doing these poses, and its poked fun at here and is funny. Overall 7/10."
105,7,"Why I am mixed on this film. While I enjoyed the film, what damaged the railing for me was that the film's beginning was way too dark for a MCU film and for a film that families were bribing their kids to. They didn't have to show girls getting tortured and brainwashed like they did in the beginning. That turned my Mom and sister off from the film."
106,7,"Female power I think most of us can admit this stand-alone Black Widow movie was well overdue and late to the game.The casting was well done, Florence Pugh holds her own against Scarlett Johansson; the actors have a believable sisterly love/hate relationship with a side of a**kicking to boot.The main problem I had with this film is that the story itself feels jumbled, and there's no real flow. The action sequences themselves are thrilling and brilliant; the dialogue scenes lack a sense of believable continuity and have an immediate dip in the story's compositional arc.The dry humor moments were funny but they passed over them so quickly that we couldn't really them.All in all it's a good film, could it have been better ? Yes. Does it do a decent job at telling Natasha's traumatizing backstory? Yes.Should you watch it? 100%"
107,7,"Good This is, surprisingly, a very efficient spy film, with strong characters, interesting dialogue and good action. There are some typical MCU issues, but this is much closer to Winter Soldier on it's tone and approach and that really worked for me."
108,6,"Somewhat forgettable Black Widow is entertaining enough from start to finish but I feel it lacked some of the key elements that made Marvel films standout. The first element is humour, there was a lack of it as well as a killer soundtrack to accompany some light hearted moments. The cast are decent who do their best to carry an average story. It would have been nice to see more action from Natasha as she nailed her scenes in all the Avenger films. This felt more like an average DC film and a bit forgettable."
109,7,Fun and worth money I will watch anything with Scarlett Johanson. Light fun entertainment. Great action and good costumes. The family drama aspects absorbed too much time.
110,8,"Surprisingly good Wasn't expecting much of Black Widow. I mean, she's an Avenger in name only really isn't she: not like she's got any real superpowers.But this film is great. Lots of action with a touch of humour as we've come to expect from Marvel (""it still fits!"").Good story. Great character development.Natasha rocks!"
111,7,"Good movie with a bunch of perks Initially I thought it to be a movie with suspensefull entries of Captain America, but later found they weren't. It would have been nice if other Avengers had also been included. Moreover it was a nice film."
112,1,"What Did I Just watch? I'm a fan of the MCU though some of it is laughably bad it's fun. This film feels like a lazy cocaine filled F9 (Fast and Furious film). It's horrendous. Story and characters are convoluted and nonsensical. The dialogue hurts my ears. The comedy is absent (it's there but there is no time where I laughed or even half chuckled), the cinematography is choppy, and the cgi is laughably bad.To showcase I will describe a scene from the film which is a great example of the absurdity in this film and why I'm comparing this to fast and furious: The two protagonists get in a car and are in this very high speed chase. Their car then gets in a crash where it flips over multiple times, hits many objects, then lands upside down and skids down a flight of stairs. The protagonists just get out of the car seconds later with nothing but a scratch on the head. This accompanied by horrendous cgi made me laugh out loud in the theater. It was absolutely absurd and very unrealistic. Of course we can't forget that they had to have been driving at least 50mph. There are many more instances of this throughout film taking me out causing me to make jokes about it instead of pulling me in and causing me to be invested. The MCU is unrealistic, I mean it's superheroes but these protagonists are human with no super abilities. Every other MCU film I've seen had limits but this film not only took of the seatbelt but rode on top of the hood while drinking caffeine. It's insane.This whole movie screams lazy and cheap, yet this is a massive multi million dollar blockbuster from Marvel and Disney. Pathetic."
113,2,"Boring. They give us a story about the character, when he's already dead. What's the point? I don't care about the beginnings of Black Widow and it's not even an origin story, it's an intermission between Civil War and Infinity War, they're all forgettable, at least Red Guardian has this charisma that is not a big deal, but he steals the whole movie, the villain has 0 characterization and besides that there is no point in surviving a literal bomb. Terrible script, terrible acting, boring soundtrack, disgusting photography, a terrible movie."
114,5,"Quite a disappointment for being a Marvel movie Halfway through everything was alright, the movie was enjoyable and the plot was unfolding nicely. But after that the rest of it was forced CGI's for the sake of having spectactular combat scenes and all that. Yes for the VFX the movie is great, they did a more than decent job. But the rest was... eh, let's say it's a ""good to watch once but just once"" movie.Why is it that a vast majority of films, of which the executive producer is also the main character, fail to impress miserably?"
115,6,"An Entertaining Headache I put myself off watching this film for a while due to my personal Marvel fatigue, I was bored one evening and decided to give this a watch.Set after the events of Civil War, Black Widow is on the run and hiding, without giving too much away an elusive mysterious character has emerged and attacked our protagonist that has connections to her dark past and family..The first hour and a half are surprisingly really entertaining, story is small and focused on family drama, with more grounded action scenes. Black Widow's character doesn't have all that room to grow within her own movie, due to her having to be the same person/character with previous Marvel films that are set in a future timeline - Infinity War and Endgame. Florence Pugh is always a delight even if the Russian accent is noticeable but not too out of place - it's better than Ray Winstones attempt (can't quite brake the cockney)The last half an hour is a headache, breaks the films more grounded first hour and a half in favour of explosions, fight scene after fight scene, five different plot threads with each individual character, sky castles and set ups for future films/seriesBetter than expected but ends with the usual ""save the world"" plot that almost feels put of place."
116,9,"better than expected Yes, this was better than expected and I was expecting quite a bit form this movie. The big surprise was the character development of the movie. So many of these assembly line Disney movies seem to skip a lot of that in many movies. This one took it's time developing some great characters and letting us decide who we would like and not, don't get me wrong, there is a top class villain to bring that whole protagonist dimension to a crescendo and give the viewer a nice ride through the movie. There was more unpredictability in this than in the 10 Rings for sure.Great watch that builds a connection between viewer and characters.Great 2 hour escape from the insanity of a pandemic world. Very needed. Nice to get back to the movies late 2021 and hope we can keep going in 2022."
117,1,"classic american hostility America and Marvel tried to vilify a country like Cuba. As he does in every film, he tried to create heroes who put you to sleep just because we exist. You're so stupid, Marvel."
118,10,"Awesome spy flick, with MCU humour I've watched this film three times and will likely watch it a few more. There is always something new to see, which is why I'm finally coming to offer a review (I'm tired of the Reddit boyz driving down the ratings of good films).Here is what I like about Black Widow:* The love story is actually about family-type love, not sexual-type love, and that is really refreshing.* Florence Pugh is so damn good.* I always though that by fridging Natasha, Endgame made a mistake; it should have been Clint that sacrificed himself, and I'm glad to have just that little bit more of Natasha Romanov before she departs the MCU forever.* David Harbour is hilarious.* The door is open to a whole bunch of kick-ass woman-centered spy films, which just rocks my boat.There's more, but really - you should just go watch the film again.Cheers!"
119,7,"It's all about Family Natasha Romanov's back story is finally revealed. We learn how she became involved in her 'line of work' at a very young age. We get a glimpse of her early family life and how it abruptly ends. I appreciate that the younger sister's story is not ignored. We learned how Natasha was able to switch gears and become an Avenger. The timeline stays fairly relevant with references to a couple of Avengers, though I wonder about The Snap. While learning what we do about Natasha, her sister, and their 'parents'; the show moves along with their personal quests to get revenge on the person who ruined their lives. With the exception of Rachel W., the actors were well cast and did a great job playing their parts and delivering their lines. Rachel W.'s character portrayal seemed off. IMHO, a Thandie Newton type would have been more to my liking."
120,6,"Disappointing This film could have worked well as a standalone. But it's not. The only reason this film exists, is to elaborate on one line black widow once said. And the worst part, is that the movie doesn't effect anything in the MCU. Nothing has changed. This film could have worked in 2016, when black widow was still alive, and it would have given a good sneak peak for infinite War. But it didn't. Instead it was delayed by a lot. What a shame."
121,10,"One of the better marvel movies Great story, character development and good arcs. Storyline is good, tasteful level of humor tucked between segments to not take away the seriousness and weight of the story. People saying it's meh is probably a bunch of misogynistic men."
122,8,Underrated Movie is very good but because there are lot of better Marvel movies this one doesn't stand out but as stand alone movie rating must be atleast over 7 stars.
123,3,She is black widow But is not black and not wearing black. Confusing.Was it like a practical joke or contractual obligation? Did Scarlett johanson throw a hissy fit and demand a movie of her own or insist she wears white or something?Anyway it is a family drama with sibling rivalry.
124,8,"Black widow Excellent film. The entire story on ""Free choice vs. Control"" was well written and produced. Scarlett Johansson excelled in her last role as Black Widow. Florence Pugh, on the other hand, stole the show. Rachel Weisz was also fantastic. Loved the dinner table scene! David Harbour's role was funny and enjoyable. The post-credits, which were originally supposed to occur before ""Falcon & Winter Soldier"", still worked very well and it doesn't confuse the audience. Scarlett is going to be missed, but Pugh has shown that she's more than capable of filling her shoes in MCU ventures.The actions sequences were amazing. In addition, the film's general plot is incredibly relatable. Anyone who believes that an action picture with a predominantly female cast and a female lead can't be exciting and spectacular should keep their mouth shut. Among ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Captain Marvel"", Black Widow establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt that a female lead in an action film can provide flawless performance.However, there are few points I'd like to make: 1. Taskmaster could have been used more effectively.2. Some scenes in the film felt rushed, but that's fine because fans of the MCU are familiar with Johansson's character and can overlook the rushed scenes.3. While this film was definitely worth the wait and the delays, I believe that the standalone Black Widow feature should be released much sooner and should have been part of the Infinity Saga timeline rather than being the Phase 4 opening.Still, it's clear so far in Phase 4 that Marvel isn't losing any steps. Great film and it looks Marvel is getting better and better!"
125,9,Bad reviews only because they're are good ones I swear all the bad reviews of this and many other movies are only because they're are good reviews. If it's cool to like a movie it must be even more cool to not like it.
126,7,"Much better than I thought, however still bittersweet ! This, for me, was one of those films that I missed earlier in the year and knew I would eventually get round to watching one day. Today happens to be that very day. I have to admit I am a little shocked, I thought this film was way way better than I thought it would be and better than a lot of reviews I've read. Now I am one of Marvel and Disney's harshest critics when it comes to the MCU, for me though this one has something about it that I really liked and overall enjoyed.Black Widow has always been a character that is too big to be a side character but not quite big enough to be a main character. I was a little surprised that they announced this film was going to be made and not a TV series instead? (Perhaps Disney saw how well Wonder Woman did over at DC and wanted some of that money because I don't think Captain Marvel did that well did it?). This film excels best by adding so much more detail and layer to the character and her background without rushing it or leaving us feel short changed. Loved the expansion of the Widow and Soviet lore that they introduced to us in this film, very interesting and cool ideas presented.The cast are brilliant ! We all know what Johansson can do by now so there is no surprise there, however I was doubtful about Pugh before which was stupid of me haha. She was awesome and maybe just maybe a good ""replacement"" for Widow going forward in the franchise. Shoutout to Ray Winstone, ahh its always great to see Ray in a film, not just that reason but also one where he isn't phoning in a performance haha. Actually thought he was pretty solid and not too over the top. Also what happened to Olga Kurylenko? Like she was in every film for a while and then just disappears, I cant remember the last film I saw her in?However, Disney dropped the ball big time with this film! Although I surprisingly really enjoyed this film and liked the change of pace for the MCU in general. They should have made this film years ago, just when the fandom was asking for it and when it would have been much more impactful. Don't plan, make and release the film after the very film where the main character ""Black Widow"" dies in the future of the franchise. This takes away all the stakes from this film, there is no jeopardy whatsoever because you know that she survives, she is alive in the future. That is why to me, this film feels a little bit like a cash grab by Marvel and Disney trying to make a quick buck because they know that this will appeal to a huge audience.What annoys me the most is the fact that this cast and the family dynamic that is grown from this film (Johansson, Harbour, Weisz and Pugh) will go absolutely nowhere from here. That leaves a very bittersweet taste in the mouth, what a waste of a time!One other minor issue I have with the film, the end fight scene........flying through the air.....really!!! Come on, we can do better than that cant we?I can't believe I am about to type this, 70% out of 100 I really enjoyed this film!! Maybe its because I had no expectations going in and saw how bad the reviews were? I thought the story had interesting concepts, even though not all of it worked. The cast was brilliant and I overall enjoyed watching the film run its course, it flew by for me. Its a mixed bag though and I completely understand why somebody, even a die hard hard, wouldn't enjoy this film. It 100% has its issues which sadly didn't need to be there if this character had been handled correctly in the first place."
127,2,"This WebSite Started This Film At 10,000 10/10 Votes Because advertising Platinum package was purchased by Dis$$$ney... But they couldn't fake the actual reviews. So you see it is rated highly (errrr) and yet all the actual human reviews are negative.Well, wouldn't it be easier if they just stopped franchising and gender switching and look up the word originality in the dictionary???This film is bad but its farting soundtrack is worse."
128,5,"😒 The only thing I can offer is that emoji in my title and a 5 star rating. If the emoji gets cleared think of it as that GIF meme of Ryan Reynolds doing a face palm in utter disappointment. Is it watchable, yes. Am I telling you don't watch it? No please do so if your interested in closing all of the angles of the MCU. But in my honest opinion this movie was hot garbage; perhaps that was why Hawkeye went direct to a TV series. And this quite frankly should have been a made for TV movie."
129,9,"Love it I was so enlivened by watching this great movie through the countdown for the new year, 2022.Hope we can see the happy end of the Covid 19 pandamic soon in the 2022!!"
130,1,"Hollywood has lost originality...years ago We do all understand that movies are just another tool of investment and this movie has 'investors' all over it. An unoriginal story bathing in Marvel's movie success. This movie also has the affliction of every other visual media that has music inherent in the production. Nothing original. Everything is a remake of when music didn't use samples and buy riffs to use in said samples. The opening credits have a 'slow version' of 'Smells like Teen Spirit' -Nirvana, and it's the same type of CRAP seen all over media now from TV ads to this nonsense. It's so incredibly bad that no one would buy the song for the song itself. The 1993 movie ""Judgement Night"". I think the music CD did better in long lasting popularity than the movie (and both were more entertaining than this facade, and the music CD is still relevant) because it had what's known as 'originality', a concept far flung from almost every corner of entertainment in 2021. Slowed down versions of rock or pop sings pre 2000 are the norm in all visual media now. Because there are no real 'riff' creators in music anymore. Just like this movie, it's all copycat BS with a huge budget and a poor work product relying on a doped up American populace to buy their product results. And yes include me in that to an extent because I watched this movie, and it's horrible. It's 2:13 hours plus my mental energy writing this. However writing this is my penance, and if I can save one soul from wasting their time if they are 'on the fence' about watching this stinkbomb. I did what I could."
131,6,"That's unfortunate... I was really looking forward to see this movie. It was the first movie I had seen in theaters since lockdown, and I was excited to see these new and interesting characters be introduced into the MCU. But, this movie just doesn't work. It would have been far more interesting to see Natasha's origin in the red room and her original mission to kill Dreykov. But instead, the movie focuses on the period between ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"" and it is significantly less interesting. Additionally, the villains in this movie are some of the worst in the MCU. Dreykov has no real motivation and Taskmaster isn't a threatening enough villain to justify the lack of personality. While some side characters such as Yelena and Red Guardian are enjoyable, it doesn't save the movie. To put it plainly this was not a great way to kick off the New phase four marvel movies, and does little to justify its existence."
132,7,"Florence Pugh Steals the Show in the Solid if Unspectacular Black Widow Part of Natasha's allure is that her past has only been hinted at. We got more of a look with Age of Ultron but Black Widow represents that payoff. The story of Natasha and Yelena's reunion and her teaming up with her adopted family to challenge the Widows is fine and deftly delivered. The implications of the other Widows being enslaved with mind control raises a few interesting questions as well. So while the overall arc of Black Widow doesn't reinvent the wheel but it's up to snuff for your typical MCU fare.Scarlett Johansson has been playing Black Widow for years, she's got the character down pat and she's consistent in her solo movie. She's slips into the steely and emotionless Natasha like a glove and she's a competent/believable action hero. Everyone knows David Harbour for his more dramatic work or his blockbuster adventures but he's got real comedic chops when he's given the opportunity. He's pretty funny as Alexei, his character was made to be the Soviet version of Captain America (Red Guardian) so I also believe he could have pulled back a little. It gets to the point he's such a buffoon that you question whether he was a competent soldier at any point in time. But that's not his performance, that's the script. Rachel Weisz was a nice inclusion to the cast, she gets a few nice moments as the girl's pseudo mother Melina. Her character is a little withdrawn in the same way Natasha is but also like Scarlett, there's some humanity and emotion underneath. Hopefully she gets more of this kind of projects, she's been mainly operating in the indie scene for years. I've been beating around the bush a little but for me, Florence Pugh far and away gave the best performance as Yelena. She's not brand new on the scene, she's an Oscar nominated actress but this was a different kind of project for her. She's capable in the action scenes, emotional for the dramatic moments but unlike Natasha, Yelena is very funny on top of that. It's easy to see why the studio tabbed Florence as a possible major player going forward. If her work here is any indication of what she can do, she could easily take over for Scarlett and possibly even elevate the character. The only performance I didn't even like came from Ray Winstone as Dreykov. Ray's a great character actor but he largely growls his way through this movie and there's little to no dimension to his character other than a general lust for power. This isn't just a Black Widow problem however, it's a recurring stumbling block in a fair amount of the MCU's filmography.Marvel has reset the bar again and again for blockbuster entertainment. It can't be easy to make something revolutionary every time action is called on set. Some adventures are going to be hits but just not quite on the bullseye. Black Widow is one of those projects. One of the aspects that it stumbles on is that it feels like a weird fit from a chronological perspective. Setting it between Civil War and Endgame makes it feel dated and late to the party. It also feels off that it would be now that Natasha chooses to go back to help disband the Widows and we never hear her speak about Yelena in any of the other movies or even spend a moment thinking about her old life. The puzzle pieces dealing with her character motivation don't quite fit. This may come across as a nitpick but this movie also features one of my least favourite tropes in any big budget movie. The whole ""let's stop the movie so I can tell you my evil plan for NO REASON instead of easily dispatching the hero"" cliche has been done to death and although there's a reason it's always included, it still feels lazy and unnecessary.Black Widow has got all the trappings and the eye candy you expect from the MCU. The CGI all passes the eye test, the Red Room looks cool and the visuals help sell some of the more outlandish stuff in the plot. The action fits the bill as well, there's some nice close quarters combat But the visual sensibility is more good than truly exceptional. You're getting the expected value with the $10-15 ticket you shelled out for.The drama surrounding Widow's release and the ensuing fallout was almost more interesting than the actual movie. All kidding aside, Black Widow is a decent entry in the MCU and it is a fine swan song for Natasha Romanoff. It's just not going to be a particularly memorable movie in the larger Marvel library. I'm excited to see what Florence will do with Yelena moving ahead and despite nothing earth-shaking being present, I wouldn't want to dissuade you from checking this out on Disney Plus. Lowered expectations would be a good idea however."
133,5,Was this the famous mission of Budapest? Jeremy Renner Had to play in this movie. Natasha must remain dead. Making this film was both wrong and unnecessary. It was better to use some familiar faces.
134,4,"Much to do about nothing The movie has a lot of action scenes; but it lacks a cohesive story. Perhaps, those viewers who are DC Multi-verse fans can make more sense of it. The entire context of the primary character does not even start to come together until the end of the movie. Then, the movie ends leaving the viewer begging for the rest of the story."
135,2,The start scared me to death Skip the 1st 16 minutes of your watching with kids. It's Not Good For Kids To Know About Child Trafficking And Being Split Apart From Their Family And Friends.
136,10,"A pleasant surprise I almost didn't watch this movie because so many movies made in 2021 have been so bad, but I have to say that I'm glad I decided to take the time to watch this one. Not only did it have almost non-stop action, it also had a really heart warming, cute story-line that was at times really funny. It may not be this years great movie, but it was certainly entertaining."
137,10,Great Great movie but launched at the wrong time (pandemic).The movie lived up the MCU expectation and hope they can have a sequel or another origin of Natasha.
138,7,"Florence Pugh is worth the watch I wouldn't even write a review if it weren't for Florence Pugh. She has, as always, perfect deadpan timing and adds a lot to any movie she's in. It's a rip roarer. Fast paced. Interesting story. Funny in all the right spots. A good show for a slow night when you don't want anything heavy duty."
139,6,"It was enh Black Widow wasn't really bad or anything, it was just really kind of dull. I thought that it started out actually really good but as it went along, it got worse and worse. Like at the beginning, it was everything i could've hoped for. It had great pacing, pretty good cinematography and fight choreography, and I actually really liked the music. It's just that...as it went along, it started to get really dull and honestly, by the end, it just gave me headache. I was just so not that invested in the story and it didn't do a really good job at actually making me care for the characters. It wasn't bad or anything...it was just weird and it didn't really do anything new. It was pretty tonally inconsistent too and it made me think to myself ""wait what am I watching again?"". By the end, it just became a huge mess as the music started blaring louder and louder with every explosion...there were a lot of explosions and it got really loud. Honestly, i'm not even annoyed or anything because the movie's still watchable and you can still have a good time with it...it just felt really weird and something felt really off with it. It actually had some great ideas too but the film executed them really strangely and honestly, it just left me really really confused throughout the entire third act. Like there was no substance or anything, there was no plot twist, no crazy reveals or anything, just a few moments that made me go ""hey, that's pretty cool"" before reverting back to my neutral state of not really knowing how to react. I don't think it's as bad as everyone's saying it is, it was honestly fine. I just wouldn't go to the theatre to watch it and it's really more the kind of thing you can watch just on your computer at 1AM because you have nothing better to do. So yeah, it was fun and I really liked it at times but all together, objectively as a film, it was really dull and pretty boring honestly. One could say it was the definition of mediocre."
140,7,Yelena stole my heart It was weird watching it while I've enjoyed Yelena's character much more than Natasha's!She has everything that Natasha lacked throughout the MCU. But seeing those two as a team on a big screen was a treat.Funny movie about a broken family - that's how I'd describe it in one sentence.Also massively disappointed in Taskmaster in this movie - just why those weird changes from the original character in the comics...?
141,6,"WYLION - Black Wid - Oh... Was anyone else expecting a backstory of early life and upbringing as a Widow? I saw my excitement flash before my eyes during the opening credits as my dreams of what I wanted to see was skipped over for a silly lazy Marvel film. It really seems this film was churned out to give the fanbase a Black Widow film in which it asked, simply to get it out the way. Parts were funny, some intense action scenes, some emotion. One thing in the whole film stood out and it has nothing to do with Black Widow - the person the film is based on. It has everything to do with Florence Pugh. I liked her in this film and I am excited for her involvement in future films and TV shows. To this date she seems to be the only reason to watch Black Widow not just because she's the best part but everything else is disposable. In everything since, she's the only thing that's been recognised in the Universe so far with importance. I'm sure this film will be forgotten. Just another below average film from Marvel. I don't know why they do it."
142,10,Passing of the Torch Although I marked 10/10 I purely was reacting to the chemistry between Natasha and Yelena which I really enjoyed and I thought brought some realism/ humanity to a marvel universe that relies on endless action scenes that often blur together. For a marvel movie I felt I actually connected with the characters and felt sad knowing this would be the only content we would be getting. This movie has plenty of issues and plot holes but was still enjoyable and brought me plenty of laughs.Lastly I see plenty of reviews critiquing the fact Natasha took a back seat to Yelena and I totally agree with those views. I do think however that it was intentionally done by marvel to create an easy way to introduce Yelena and gain a larger following for the character which = more $$$$. Marvels bottom line like any major film studio. I would have liked to delve more into the character of black widow but that's wishful thinking I guess.
143,6,"Distinctly average Black Widow was much delayed by having its release slot given to Captain Marvel, and then by the pandemic. I'm afraid it was hardly worth the wait.The story could have been good, if it was properly devleoped; the characters are good, but the film is confusingly handled by its director; many of the plot reveals are thrown away, and I felt, in the end, a certain exasperation with this movie. The farm scene is the most boring thing in the MCU so far - it goes on forever, and then we have flashbacks to if for plot reveals that just fall flat. It could have been great. In the end merely so so. A film that felt passe the moment it came out. Given the delays surely Marvel could have done reshoots to improve the flow of the story.Scarlet is a bad, pouty actress. Ray Winstone made for an awful villian, with a bad Russian accent that he borrowed from Cate Blanchette in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The family theme is half-decent, and the reason I gave it a 6 rather than a 4.Still, it was better than Aquaman, which I watched a couple of days' later. Only just. Comic book movies are going downhill recently."
144,7,"A bit below average by Marvel's standards As someone who grew up in the former Soviet Union, I find it appaling that after all these years Hollywood still can not get Russia right. From accents (there are millions Russian speaking immigrants in this country, you really can't find someone to consult on right phrases to say and get the right accents or have proper labels in the damn helicopter?) to factual mistakes - I lol'd when they'd shown Black dudes in a Russian prison and then a person with an oxygen tank. No matter how inclusive you want to get, there are barely any Black faces in Russian prisons."
145,7,Satisfying conclusion Overall plot is average. Expected a better screenplay from a MCU movie. Acting was good from lead four. Scarlett Johansson left her mark strong in the MCU with this movie.The family angle could have been handled better. Cinematography and vfx are only getting better and better with Marvel movies.
146,1,"It's soooo boring I have yet to see a more boring movie in 2021. Seriously! It's full of clichés, long and tedious dialogues, short and inconsequent action scenes... just stay away. You won't miss a thing. Seriously, save your time."
147,1,"Menacing female gymnasts The acting and plot is so mediocre I could not force myself past 40%, and that with great effort. This movie sucks, if you want to see a well done movie about female fighters just watch Wonder Woman.Now, of course we all know Hollywood is trying to convince us women are exactly like men, but having a bunch of rather short feminine gymnasts gracefully jumping around and doing cart wheels makes for a laughable guild of female assassins. Can't even the casting right..I'd skip this one, not worth anyone's time."
148,1,"The Unwatchables On Christmas day, the star ratings are holding steady at 6.7 (two-thirds) out of nearly 3,000 user reviews. I rented the blu-ray for the extras.Yeah, let's probe deeper into the psychological mindsets of our beloved superheroes. The Spiderman franchise pioneered the trend. What shows up on the screen in this specific example is a hodge podge of explosions, chashes on foot and in vehicles, acrobatics on wires, gun fights, more explosions and then some uncomfortable dialog about childhood traumas and reconciliatition.Being a bigger fan of the DC Universe than of the Marvel, I suppose that I am biased. The extended conversations dealing with inner feelings didn't do anything for me. The movie is pretty much unwatchable.DUD, DUD, DUD, DUD . . . It's a dud.""Talk amongst yourselves."" ~ Linda Richman."
149,7,"Good fun and entertaining movie Another hit from Marvel that works - lots of action scenes and decent CGI and good humour and a plot that makes sense - well directed and produced. Capable acting and some very good bits too by Rachel Weisz. Enjoyable movie with female leads, but made without the pushing of the 'social agenda' of diversity and equality. When will Hollywood learn that equality and respect cannot be demanded - they are both earned. There are many good movies with female leads lately, without needing to force the 'message', and this is one of them."
150,7,"A good character drama held back by the marvel formula This movie honestly has some of the best character work I've seen recently in a marvel movie. The interpersonal relationships are some of the most compelling and raw that Marvel has produced and had me drawn to the screen for the first two acts. Black Widow and her extremely dysfunctional family are incredibly engaging and the actors do a good job bouncing off of each other. Unfortunately, a movie that would have benefited from a smaller scale is hurt by the studios need to have big stakes and thus the third act turns into a real mess as all the well done character work takes a back seat to action that is at times hard to follow and mess. It can also be riveting, as one fight scene showed. As well, a few good character moments are undercut by Marvel's continuous need to add in humor because they think the same joke told 50 times is still funny. As well, the main villain isn't too captivating and his main minion suffers from the same lack of personality that the Winter Soldier had. The CGI at the end also looks really dodge and hurts the movie. And finally, this movie should have come out years ago, not after this character was already gone. Now, all that being said, this is still fun and humorous movie that is brimming with good character work it's first two acts and the last act is merely mediocre. It's a good movie that could have been more."
151,7,Really not all that bad If you're looking to find fault it's easy enough. If you're just looking for a reasonable action flick to Pass a couple of hours this is fine. Having read the reviews I was expecting sharknado but it really wasn't that bad at all. It's not the best avengers movie but it was certainly in keeping with the rest of the films and should be watched if you're a fan.
152,8,"The solo movie fans wanted before Captain Marvel. Black Widow serves as a prologue and origin story for Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow. The film primarily functions as a stand-alone adventure, incapable of setting up a direct sequel. I described this movie as a delightful, at times tragic, globe-trotting trip. The tale is influenced by the film's comic-book-style sci-fi cliches. Shortland's action sequences have a nasty, intimate grit as well as a dazzling zoomed-out sweep.When two people fight in a dirty Budapest apartment, the film is just as exciting. The physics in this film differ from those in previous Marvel films. What awaits Yelena or any of the other scruffy characters in this film is unknown. Scarlett Johansson and Kevin Feige worked tirelessly to make Black Widow a reality."
153,3,"No One Dislikes This Because The Lead Is A Female Everyone dislikes it because it is stupid, inconsequential, boring, has bad actresses and even has the stereotypical gender switch. I love Valerian or The Fifth Element or the Alien or D. E. B. S. or or or.They took a minor Marvel character and added a gender switch and gave us a Sherlock Holmes mystery that is boring."
154,6,Mwah A 'ok' movie not well written just a ok story but yeah this is her last movie as black widow I just expected a bit more. ------------ ----------------------
155,3,"Bad Script! The whole script is total garbage. The dialogues, the jokes, the characters, simply; everything said, and most of the things done, are cheesy, silly and way off! The movie made me sick. Black widow deserves a better move, way better movie! I mean what kind of person wrote this ""script""and thought yeah this is a great script, and then what kind of person approved it thinking it will make a great movie?!?"
156,3,"What a huge let down The story was ok, their attempts at comedy were extremely cringe and totally unnecessary. The story wasn't too bad fighting was decent but why I gave this such a low rating was the end. How could they end a movie like that and not explain anything. Lazy writing! It seems Disney is starting to get pretty good at hiring lazy writers."
157,10,"almost as good as sky high(2005) I know some ppl hate this movie cuz a woman is the lead, but i really liked it. The final scene where they're falling from the sky was incredible to see in theatres. I cried three times. The opening scene was absolutely heartbreaking. This may have been one of the darkest marvel movies."
158,5,"Florence Pugh made this movie watchable Title says it all. I need more Florence Pugh in my life. What a hot little minx. Other then that, the movie was okay. Some funny parts with Red Guardian and good action throughout bit kind of disappointing."
159,10,"Best Marvel Movie Black Widow is the best marvel movie and I refuse to hear anything but that. The ""family"" dynamics throughout the movie get you hooked into the way the characters grow, while also having loads of action scenes which are fantastically done! Yelena is my favorite MCU character so I may be biased, but this is seriously an amazing movie!!! Could watch 100000 times and not get bored of it."
160,1,"Chore to decipher A complete disservice to the black widow. The Russian accents are almost insulting. The fight choreography is amateur. Most of scarlet fighting is CGI and the reason why becomes obvious when you see her actually ""fight"". The plot was hot garbage."
161,9,"Goodbye Natasha! The first film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It amuses me that Kevin Feige planned out everything since the beginning of the MCU, no loose ends, everything perfectly connected as all things should be.Florence Pugh was the real star of this film, she was a total badass and a GOAT. Can't wait to see her character in future MCU projects."
162,4,"I just don't get it There were a lot of really well-written movies starring a strong woman who kicks major ass throughout said movies. At some point, the studios decided ""NO! TOO SUBTLE!"" And ever since then they've found it necessary to shoehorn in some toxic masculine characters to oppress the strong woman, some extremely obvious and forced messages of feminism, and scenes that portray the strong woman as literally indestructible... not much of a reaction you can expect from the audience when you decide to make the main character bulletproof. Anyway, they evidently didn't learn their lesson from captain marvel."
163,3,"They Need ""content"" To fill the ""platform"" because Wall Street needs ""revenue growth"" and ""subscriber numbers"" and punishes ""subscriber attrition"" and hence they fart these movies out and zzzzzzzzzzzzRIP marvel."
164,10,"Emotional and amazing experience Black widow has been my favorite character forever now, so her finally having her own solo movie is everything I ever wanted. I was so excited and frankly scared to go see this movie. As soon as I sat down and the movie began I started crying I was so proud of Natasha and so emotionally attached to this character and movie from the beginning. By the end I had cried laughed and felt every emotion you could think of. This movie is a masterpiece. The acting is amazing, the cast and crew is amazing and the experience you get from watching it is amazing. I will always love Natasha more than anything else so this movie will always be so emotional but so beautiful and special to me."
165,6,"H-it girl. Whether the MCU can pull itself out of the fire, Black Widow may be where the rot set in to the franchise.It's largely dull and formulaic hanging on Johansson's charisma free performance there are spectacular set pieces as you would expect but no real drama and a laugh vacuum (jokes about forced sterilisation?!) Because it's a Disney film it's about orphans and siblings and getting the band back together over the course of 2 and a half predictable hours.A slick, professional and expensive looking experience but clumsy, noisy and a bit too violent to be entertaining."
166,2,Yup A Franchise Film People really need to stop watching franchise films. To put it in technical terms: they suck... they really suck.. big time.Boring family dramedy with a hint of Sherlock Holmes and gender switch drama... they really have run out of characters. Either that or this was a contractual obligation.
167,3,"sorry it was boring I'm sorry for all the marvel fans, but we have to face the facts, the movie was boring and bad. Luckily I didn't see this movie in the cinema or pay a lot of money via stream, it was included in my Disney + offer with no extra fees, I just paid with wasted lifetime.The CGI was good as usual, only the old Russian helicopter you could see it didn't always fit in with the scenery."
168,8,"A Great film that gives Black Widow the spotlight So after a delay of over a year Black Widow is finally out and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Natasha Romanoff is on the run and forced to reunite with figures from her past to uncover a mystery.Main Character Scarlett Johansson is back for potentially her final time as Black Widow and she is really good in the main role here. We have always seen her as a supporting player but she is thrust into the main character and thrives. Her really interesting backstory is further explored and it allows us as an audience to get more time with her and really see and learn more about her. She is also great in the action sequences and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast as well.Supporting Characters Florence Pugh plays Yelena and for me she was the best part of the film. The chemistry between her and Johansson is fantastic and was the emotional crux of the film, she is great in the action scenes and nails the humorous and emotional scenes that are required. Dave Harbour and Rachel Weisz play there bizarre parents and they are both great, Harbour is sometimes seen as comic relief and does it well but also has some good emotional moments for him to deliver. Weisz is more stoic and intense but plays an important role and you see how these four are so dysfunctional but really need each other. As seen in the trailer Taskmaster is the villain here and I think diehard fans of the character will be disappointed but I thought it worked for this film. He reminded me of the T1000 from Terminator 2 and was just a warrior hunting Black Widow but there is very little character there to bet invested in. That links to the greater issue that is Ray Winstone as the villain and that whole part of the film, it is really generic and he isn't given anything interesting to work with and his motivations and whole arc is kind of in the background and it just didn't work for me.Story The story is decent, this is basically a film about the concept of family and how it isn't always the people you choose and that part of the film was good for sure with all the actors really selling it and I grew to care about all of them and the relationships that get built up. But again my main criticism was the whole villain angle of the film, Taskmaster isn't as interesting as he could have been and the whole generic Russian bad guy is surely played out but used here and I also had an issue with the actual ending of the film. It is really abrupt and doesn't really make sense when linked up to its place in the timeline.Script I thought the script was good, I have seen some criticism of the amount of humour involved but I actually though this film took itself quite seriously for the first act. The model for the MCU is to try and balance the humour and drama and I thought the film did it well, I felt the drama when it wanted and I laughed when it wanted so I give the film credit for that.Style The film has some huge action set pieces but I thought they all worked really well, obviously there is a difficulty to raise tension and stakes with a prequel but the film did as good as possible with those limitations. The film is paced well, and felt an appropriate length, though maybe 5 more minutes at the end would have been appreciated.Overall Overall, Black Widow is a great fun film that is worth the year long wait for big Marvel fans. If you are on board with The MCU then go and see Black Widow as you will enjoy it and there is a big post credit scene here too.Rating - 8/10."
169,6,"Widows all across Earth ""The only natural resource the world has too much of: girls."" Yup, there are feministic aspects in this movie.Black Widow is a low-impact movie on the backstory of Natasha. It wasn't bad but it also wasn't good. At least I prefer Natasha to Captain America + his buddies.The part overlaid with music at the beginning was different and well-executed! It was pretty nice music.The end of the fight was too long and kind of boring. The CGI explosions looked pretty bad.So yeah. Average movie."
170,3,"No substance I like the actors in this film, but they play characters that are flatter than a piece of paper. The purpose of a film is to tell a story. Thus is just one long fight scene, with zero character development or plot. I had to shut it down half way through."
171,8,Great Great movie. They told us the story of Black Widow between Civil War and Infinity War. The opening credits are awesome. Black Widow is a great avenger.
172,2,"Pointless snooze I was bored with this film already fifteen minutes in, and it didn't change during the whole thing. Ridiculous dialogues, such pathetic attempts at humor and what was even the point of this entire film? A complete waste of my time, and a shame Natasha's last hurrah amounted into that. Two thumbs down."
173,10,"Understand what it would take to be her Yes. It's spy movie, action and MCU. But understand that both of the protagonist don't want to be there. Bond, Thor, Rodgers, even Banner. They all want to be heroes. She doesn't, that was you are missing. Amazing movie, that touches a real trouble."
174,7,"Scope for More As one of the key origin films, especially after endgame, this movie had created high hopes. However, it was unable to live up to the expectations. Scarlett Johanneson did a decent job at executing the story and bringing more emotions to the character, but the action and the acting in a few places were too typical of a superhero movie and could not match the originality of movies like the black panther. It's a decent film, but it could have been much more with respect to its storyline, fleshing out of characters and the screenplay."
175,7,Solid MCU entry Black Widow is a solid entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Great action and a decent story make this an entertaining film and a fond farewell for Scarlett Johansson.
176,9,Well done Unlike Eternals and Deadpool this movie was fun to watch. The humor was fun and the action was perfect. I enjoyed the back story and how Black Widows sister would be used in future marvel movies like Hawk Eye. I was glad to see that the language was cut to a minimum and no sexual senses were in this movie. It's proof you can have a good movie without all the trash in it like the 2 movies mentioned above.
177,4,"The ""Solo"" of the MCU Yes just like Solo, let's take a beloved character of a franchise, who already died in a previous film, and give them their own prequel with virtually no stakes whatsoever. Great job Disney."
178,3,"Ebert is my goto critic ... but not foolproof! Yes, it did have a story ... but the movie lives of action scenes that are too long (I fast forward), rather than exploring a more attractive ""family"" saga. The idea to make a series out of this is .... Oh well, I won't speak I'll of the ""Avengers"".Happy to have seen Scarlett and her companions ... the script was a desaster."
179,4,"Half Watchable Made it half way through. Very predictable and As others have commented I don't understand how someone with no powers does the things she does. Bad acting, horribly fake Russian accents. Black Widow To me is not a character that should have had their own movie."
180,6,this was so bad for marvel movie Will give 6/10 only because Scarlett Johansson is in I like her a lot and the one that play her sister Elena was also good. But the hole movie was just stupid and unrealistic to such an extent that even the battle scenes that are supposed to grab you are boring. Is kind of waste of 2 h + from your life to watch it.
181,5,Not as expected I thought there would be high actionStoryGood screenplayBut got bored in some timeBetter to avoid watching.Nothing impresses to watch one more time.
182,8,"Top models turned into latex ninjas I'm not a huge fan of action movies, and I'm not familiar with the Marvel Universe at all, but I enjoyed this movie. It has a good pace, a variety of settings and good dialogues. And a lot of action. The one scene that dragged on a bit too long was the family reunion scene. The scenes with the robotised henchman were also a bit hard to believe.I thought I would be lost at the beginning, knowing nothing abouut Marvel but the story unfolds quite naturally. I've never heard of the Red Room, Dragov, not even the Avengers, but that wasn't a problem to understand, and to enjoy the story. I loved some of the plot twists, never a dull moment in this film. Maybe I should check out another Marvel movie..."
183,5,"A learning experience. I'm going to try watching it again but I couldn't really wach this movie. But I think I know why It's hard to watch some movies now:Movies of the past were great at almost any scene. If you missed a part or even the whole beginning, the rest of the movie was still good. That's not true of most movies today though. A good example of this is the matrix -- no matter what point you watch that movie at, it's still good.And that's especially not true of this movie, IMO. If something isn't really interesting I just kind of tune it out, and that's what my brain was doing with this movie. I don't know if it's because I just couldn't keep track of all the story and information but I think it has something to do with just how interesting each scene is, because movies like venom I have Almost no problem with (but that's also I think just because venom is just a really good movie at every scene). I'm not saying a lot of work wasn't put into this movie, but it just maybe didn't pay off.I don't know but just wanted to give my two cents. Maybe it's not worth anything, but maybe it is."
184,5,"Action movie with medicore visuals thats nothing to do with Marvel I just watched o movie full of unlinked scenes to the overall story. Sorry to have this as a Marvel Movie...As a Marvel fan, I could bot get any attachment to the characters, even to black widow, who looks very different then Marvel other series.."
185,7,"Better than I thought I've read a lot of reviews about this movie, and most of them weren't good. So I didn't have high hopes for this movie at all. But after finishing it, it was surprisingly good. The acting was good, the actions scenes were very well made. I think the director did a really good job. I've never heard of her before, but she did a way better job than the directors of Captain Marvel.Scarlett and Florence both are amazing in this movie, and play off each other well. The main villian is....ok, I would say he was amazing, but we didn't really get to see much of him. The other side characters weren't all that good either; David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz are more or less shoved at the sideline.This movie is very much similar to the Mission Impossible saga, from the action, cinematography, and even the music sounds the same (which isn't a shock considering it's the same composer). But this seems to work for the film.Black Widow is good, it's far from one of the best, but it was good to see a decent send off to Black Widow. I feel like this movie is several years too late. Can't believe we got Captain Marvel before this movie. Ridiculous.7/10."
186,5,"A mess - some decent action but the plot is all over the place The best parts of Black Widow are some of the early action scenes which involve fighting, explosions, mystery and sudden surprises. They remind me a bit of Winter Soldier - how efficient the villain was.However, none of the rest of the movie lives up to those brief glimpses of potential. The plot is far too complicated and uninteresting. Way too many characters are introduced without developing them. The later action scenes are bloated, generic, incoherent and dull with way too much obvious CGI.Also, fundamentally, for this to come out after Endgame and about 20 other MCU movies completely undermines it. There is little or no tension since it's a prequel. Nobody important can die, for example. There aren't any particular gaps which needed filling in in the first place. I did not yearn for this movie. It's nice that Black Widow finally got her own movie, but it came too late to mean anything in the wider MCU.The plot barely holds together or makes sense. It's a mildly interesting concept, but one which has been done to death. Black Widow offers no real original twists on the concept. It's too far-fetched to take seriously.The main adversary is cool at times, quite intimidating, fast, skilled and mysterious. But he/she (wearing a masked suit it's hard to tell) is not really developed. Another main villain is also 1- dimensional.I didn't understand what was happening with Widow's family. It wasn't clear who did what or why. Like so many movie characters, they barely communicate. It seems to be obligatory that they fight, lie and get angry in order to create drama. I prefer to understand characters and their motivations, not just get annoyed at how selfish or manipulative they are or how lazy the screenwriters are.Unfortunately, Black Widow feels like a completely unnecessary exercise. Some of the action is alright, some dramatic moments are decent, Scarlett is good and there's some attempt at developing her backstory, but it ultimately falls apart. It changes nothing, it relies on cliches, it's big and loud but not exciting and it's too dark and serious to excuse its plot flaws and tedious over-reliance on CGI."
187,1,"filler movie that's just plain unnecessary I would've never imagined to see a day where I watched a movie with no redeeming factors. It's boring, filled with stupid plots and there's nothing in this movie that I've never seen before. The high point of this movie is debris falling from the sky."
188,10,"Great film. Just another great film from marvel. Funny, inventive and a story that makes sense in a marvel universe that could easily unravel if they get it wrong. Tells a story and adds depth to an already huge universe. Love it."
189,10,"loved it!!!! Black Widow is an action/adventure movie that came out in 2021 but takes place right after Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Black Widow has been nominated for 4 People's Choice Awards while only being out since July 9, 2021. Black Widow is the highest grossing movie in 2021 and made 181.5 million dollars here and is the fifth highest grossing movie worldwide while making 371 million dollars throughout the whole world. Compared to other Marvel films the movie did okay, but for it being the second woman-leading Marvel film I think it did really well. Even though Black Widow is a Marvel film about the backstory of Natasha Romanoff it sheds a light on real-world problems like sexism.Personally, I loved the movie so much because I'm already a huge Black Widow fan but to know more in detail about her backstory made me love her even more. In the past Marvel films they talked about her backstory a little bit but not that much, but in this one everyone finally got the chance to see the trauma she went through as a child. I thought the fighting scenes were really good and showed Black Widow's strength. I also really like how they started from the very beginning to show everything that happened. Black Widow is all about Natasha's backstory and the Red Room. The Red Room is a place where this guy Dreykov takes little girls and turns them into soldiers/spies while traumatizing them in the process. It starts out when she's a child with her ""family"", in quotes because it's not her actual family because all the widows are either taken or bought from their biological families. There's Natasha, her 'sister' Yelena(a little girl that Dreykov was waiting to get older so she could go to the Red Room), her 'mother' Melina (Dreykov's scientist) and her 'father' Alexie (first Russian super-soldier). The fake family was a 3 year long mission for Melina and Alexie, after the three years were up Natasha and Yelena were taken to the Red Room. After 21 years of being separated Yelena gets released from the Dreykov's mind control and finds Natasha and together they find 'their parents' to take down the Red Room for once and for all.This movie's whole purpose is to go into detail about Black Widow's past and introduce Yelena into the multiverse. The whole film making process and the way they laid everything out in that order was honestly just genius. In the movie after Natasha and Yelena were taken to the Red Room as kids the scene where they showed what was going on in the Red Room was amazing editing. It showed the trauma they went through and how majorly they were messed up as children. Also when Natasha and Yelena broke Alexie out of prison Yelena talked about how they don't have any reproductive organs anymore because at the Red Room they performed involuntary hysterectomies on all the girls. Then, when Yelena bought herself a jacket, she was so excited because it was the first act of free will she had for herself since Dreykov had taken that away from them with mind control. Also when, Yelena was telling Natasha about how maybe like 1 out of the 20 girls he takes make it through training and the other ones he kills because he has no regard for any of the girls' lives. All of those scenes highlight the great amount of sexism in this movie. The fact that he only takes girls is sexist as it is but taking their reproductive organs away so they can never have children to forever be a slave/soldier to him is so sexist.All in all I thought the movie was a solid 8-9/10 and the portrayal of sexism throughout the movie was very clear. The film making and plot of the entire movie was great."
190,5,"A decent orgin to Black Widow but it should have a lot more earlier Just some word of advice for people who are new to the MCU i would personally view this before Iron Man 2.That being said while this film does have the key elements of how Natasha became Black Widow, it did rush stuff like the Red room origin which can only be seen as the opening of the film.Also, I really dislike how. Task master was displayed not only was he gender swapped to a woman but they made him so week and unfaithful to the comics.I don't hate this film but I can't say I like it either."
191,7,"Florence Pugh gives a show stopping performance as Yelena Belova Black Widow is a fun and entertaining MCU flick that managed to keep me engaged from beginning to end. Despite a rather underwhelming third act and an underdeveloped and underutilised villain (as in Taskmaster), it still benefited from its portrayal of the family dynamics and the charismatic supporting characters.The film takes place after the events of Age of Ultron and before Captain America: Civil War. In fact, the ending briefly sets up Civil War.The car chase sequence in Budapest is my favourite moment of the entire film. The choreography and CGI looked polished and moved at a fast pace.Despite its rather serious subject matter, the film has a bunch of witty moments between Natasha and Yelena. Red Guardian is another stand-out character who was even better than the lead character of the film.Although I thought that this film was a rather odd choice to be the original kick-off to phase 4, the post credits scene made me think otherwise. It takes place post-blip, and we see Yelena Belova visit her sister's grave. A woman shows her a photo of Clint Barton aka Hawkeye, specifying that he is responsible for Natasha's death. I became a huge Yelena Belova fan and cannot wait to see her in Hawkeye.To conclude, while Black Widow isn't a top tier MCU film, it still is a solid outing that delves into Natasha Romanoff's backstory. Yet she is vastly outshined by Yelena Belova portrayed by Florence Pugh who is the breakout star of the film.Final verdict: 7.8/10."
192,6,6 Stars may be too many Judging from the other reviews I get a feeling a lot of people didn't think very much of this movie. Looking at the awards nominations I think the movie critics agree but it was action packed and good escapism.
193,8,Very enjoyable Only issue was Ray Winstones acting which was awful. Didn't know if he was meant to be South African or Russian. Expected much more from him but as it was. Minor role it didn't spoil the film.
194,1,"Holy Mother Of God So f'n boring I describe it as like a Dominos Pizza.. it is that predictable and boring... it is the cardboard pizza of movies.For heaven's sake let me say I am a lover of entertainment, but these people make no sense with their black widow dressed in white it is like fat tattooed lieberal women."
195,6,Long way off the marvel standard This I was hoping would be a fun and interesting entry into the black widow story but it feels weak and for the die hard fans it struggles to keep you interested and also what was they thinking with how they portrayed the taskmaster villain.Good entertainment for non fans but fans themselves will find plenty wrong with it.
196,8,"You can never escape family. This was an exciting movie that had some serious moments of family drama. At times, it felt like a 10-star film but it sputtered. Great acting moments and then awkward and not entirely believable moments. Scarlett Johannson is solid with great charisma. She is especially good in the intense scenes, whether drama or combat, but is sometimes off in the other scenes which aren't high octane. The supporting cast - the family - were all brilliant. I especially liked Rachel Weiss as the mother figure. David Harbour offers some great moments of comedy amidst the serious drama. Florence Pugh is a master scene-stealer as Yelena, the younger ""sister."" The villain, General Dreykov, is a little bit underwritten and doesn't come across as a three dimensional character. Also, they didn't make much of the Taskmaster character. I suspect some of this character's scenes may have been cut.Also, it doesn't make sense at the end why Natasha wouldn't have stayed with her family and the newly rescued widows. They would really need her and it seemed like a perfect place for her to be with a group with which she had so much in common. She could have even used the girls to help the fractured Avengers group. It seemed like a no-brainer. It felt like Natasha left because that's what had been previously established in the other movies. Oh, don't miss the end credits - it sets up future developments for an upcoming Marvel TV series."
197,1,"It's the type of movie you don't pause when you go to take a piss and get another beer. It's like the most boring parts of every marvel film, you know the parts where nothing is actually happening in between action sequences. It extends that into the entire movie. There is limited dialog. Nothing of any interest happens. It's by far THE worst Marvel film to date. Why? Because she has no powers. They took the most uninteresting character from the Marvel universe and made a whole movie about her. It just doesn't work. I could only take an hour before I had to just bail on it."
198,3,"I am an MCU expert Don't tell anyone I know all about MCU but right now I ahev dedicated myself to expertise on Wikipedia bout japanese and so I can tell you this is not that. No japanese, no almond eyed and certainly no beautiful future Mrs for me (Sacrlett is big boned). And why change the gender of task mister?"
199,5,"Black Widow Review By Kamal KThe film starts really well but the main bad guy, Dreykov, is pretty generic and has some bad dialouge which is bordering on cheesy. The movies ending isn't as crazy as other MCU movie endings but it's still very over the top. The actual movie itself seems a bit late late to the party, we already know Black Widow is going to live so there was no sense of danger for her character and it didn't quite seem like a positive send off for her either... it felt very displaced. In saying all of that though, it's still an exciting film and it has some genuinely funny commentary throughout on the MCU and specifically Black Widows journey within it. The one thing I am dissapointed about is the portrayal of Taskmaster..."
200,2,Hollywood Is A Junkie Their all druggies Addicted to making franchise movies. That is all. No story? No problem. Actress cannot act? No problem. Desperate for characters? No problem.This one is not even connected to the original character. It takes the story and meaning of superheroes and family and betrays it. Knives it in the belly.It is so boring I wondered how the actresses did not fall asleep mid-scene.Oh and a gender switch YAWN.
201,9,"High expectations, Extremely Satisfying! This was the most hyped movie release of 2021 for me. Black Widow is one of my favorite Marvel characters. I like a lot of people were extremely excited to hear Black Widow would finally have her own movie. The movie is heavy on the Familial bonds and the results of them. It has a lot of depth uncommon in super hero movies. Lots of heart warming moments with Natasha and her family. The movie has the perfect blend of slow and deep moments, and the fast paced high action scenes. I have watched this movie at least 8 times since it's release. It has easily become one of my favorite MCU movies! A great movie for the whole family!! One of the best movies of 2021!"
202,4,"Copy Paste Marvel movie #20 Black Widow is a world-class spy so you probably anticipated a spy movie. Well you were wrong. You get a wonder woman movie where a character with no super powers is just indestructible.The plot has no originality at all, you actually forget about the movie 5 mins after it's end. I guess after Disney acquired Marvel, we are going to see the same movie again and again. Cheesy dialogs, lazy writing, no character build up, some cool VFX action -> Served !!!"
203,8,"Not the worst Marvel movie, Not the best either. Scarlett Johansson returns one last time as Natasha Romanoff in her final adventure as the deadliest member of the Avengers. Black Widow delivers all of the action and traditional MCU formula we have come to expect and enjoy at this point in time. Though the movie occasionally is bogged down by lazy dialogue, and a plot that feels rushed and uninspired."
204,7,"This was decent, not just that great ""Black Widow"" is the only movie featuring Black Widow. The best part is probably at the beginning where we learn about her origin. It's weird how they showed a Twilight pony toy from 2010 when that scene takes place in 1995! I will admit this wasn't one of the best entries. It just didn't seem to tie that well into the other films. I just wanted more appearances from the other Marvel characters.It was a lot more like a James Bond movie. We do in fact even see a scene from a James Bond movie to show where they got the idea from. The story is that Black Widow is trying to find the Red Room, which uses a chemical implanted into their agents called widows that controls their minds. Black Widow is shown with her family that she was raised with.These aren't Black Widow's real family, but they still play off her pretty well. The scene after the credits went on for three minutes, a new record that I've seen! ***"
205,7,"Super girl needs to fight her inner demons and past demons. This said fight is good, but it is not fresh I watched this movie with my family as a family-time movie with a rating suitable enough for my daughter to watch. Turns out the ride was ok.This movie is yet another same old superhero stuff. Definitely not bad, but just the same you are used too.Getting to know Natasha's past is cool, but it feels shallow. There is not much information about the organization she was part of.I am biased when watching superhero movies. I find them pleasant to the eyes because of all the graphics and stunts, but the plot is always the same.A good watch if you like superheroes or if you are willing to watch something family-friendly with someone. Not really my thing, though."
206,2,Why all the good reviews? Gender switched filler boredom!I actually disliked this movie and I can't wait for the rest of MCU films to be cancelled because people are developing taste.I'm so glad Black Widow finally got her own solo film so people can laugh and notice she is useless in Avengers.
207,2,"Should have been called: Yelena Movie seemed more about little sister than the Black Widow. Pretty much bored me to tears. Not sure how/why I finished it, guess just so I could say ""I gave it every chance""? Failed miserably.Marvel, when are you going to start making good movies again?"
208,8,Loved it So nice to see an MCU movie about female badasses. I would have liked to see more of Natasha during her schooling years so we could have seen what exactly made her. But I still really liked the story overall! Also so happy to see Florence Pugh enter the MCU.
209,7,"Heavy on action. Meh on everything else I hate to say it, but I'm just not that interested in the more minor characters in the MCU, so my rating may be biased. The action was intense as expected. Also get ready for get another film full of long choreographed fight scenes. Also if you are watching these film in chronological order, there is a major spoiler after the credits."
210,2,A pathetic cash grab What is next? They will have the waitress in Avengers who was in that film for 3 seconds have her own movie?Really scraping the bottom of the barrel.Back here at black Widow she is wearing white and has a booboo with her sister and has no super powers.Snore.
211,3,"More MCU schlock. Dear Exec. Prod ScarJo. The failure of ""Black Widow"" is not the fault of Disney marketing - the fault of ""Black Widow is in the movie of itself. My husband I watched it twice, and frankly... it's a dud. It is atypical MCU drivel - from the MCU playbook; a lot of explosions, a lot of flash, some smarmy, feel-goody dialog and some bright, shiny thing that is being hunted. But no substance.The movie editing was terrible; sections really needed to be cut out, cut down, left on the editing room floor, saved for a blooper reel or for some ""Deleted Scenes"" portion of a DVD. Way too much indiscernible dialog (what is with all the whispering in movies any more?). Way too much time was wasted setting back stories and bringing the core cast together.The anachronisms were distracting; blue hair dye in 1995 was the first, then came the opening credit montage of events from the 1970's (President Carter?), then ""21 years later"" (2016) with technology and vehicles that are current to today. We gave up trying to understand the timeline.The villain in Dreykov and his floating fortress made no sense; not in trying to tie the BW timeline into MCU. If he would have been holed up in some mountain lair lie Hydra was in ""Captain America"", that would have been plausible, but this was just... schlock.As for the casting - that was a bright spot. Loved Florence Pugh, between her and David Harbour, they had some of the best MCU-ish lines in the movie. Rachel Weisz was well cast, too. It's a shame that none of that rose of above the MCU schlock.Anyhow. Glad you got a paycheck out of it."
212,8,"Much Better Than The New James Bond Movie I am not sure why people are giving this movie such a low rating. The writers did a good job with this script. Action packed like Winter Soldier and it actually shows Black Widow in situations more suited to her skill set. Fighting folks with with godlike abilities in the Avengers made no sense, but doing spy type stuff totally acceptable. Don't listen to the haters... just watch it and judge for yourself. It is quite enjoyable. Too bad it wasn't released after Winter Soldier, it would have had a much better reception."
213,10,"More family than the Fast and Furious franchise I watched this on Disney+. There is a short (57s) filmmaker introduction to the film (under Extras) where Director Cate Shortland describes her overall vision of the film that she set out to direct. She mentions that she wants viewers to see another side of Natasha that we haven't seen before, and Natasha's role within her fantastic family. I found this film to have a lot more dramatic depth of characters and their relationships with each other than maybe any other MCU film so far. So anyone claiming that this is a formulaic Disney film is wrong about that. The family component, and what a family really means, is the key takeaway form this film. The Marvel universe is just the backdrop. On top of that, the story, action and humor are up to par with the best MCU films. Kudos to the director for pulling it off."
214,2,"What a mess What an absolute dog's breakfast of a movie. Rambling incoherent plot - the bad guy wants control of the world but so what? For what ends? Just vapid, unintelligible nonsense, with a few points awarded for stylish set pieces.Meh, with extra side helpings of meh with a meh glaze."
215,7,"Better than Eternals.. This was overall a good movie. Florence Pugh added some amusement with her funny accent and Scarlett Johansson was cool as always. I liked the jokes, many of them, but they're still not in the same class as the avengers movies. However, if you still haven't seen this film, do it. It was good enough and a whole lot better than the new Eternals-junk!"
216,6,"So lacklustre This was really a disappointment. Taskmaster was a lame villain, and it was way too talky. After waiting two years, it's clear that the trailer had the best parts. The acting was good, but the jokes fell flat and there wasn't nearly enough action. Marvel really did Black Widow, one of my favorite characters in their cinematic universe a double disservice; first they killed her off in Avengers: Endgame (a movie felt was too long and in parts too dull) and now this, which really had almost too many characters in it. Could have been much better."
217,2,"It Is Not Boring It is Very Boring Filler episode with a minor character that does nothing other than try to stir up family drama so she can do her usual cartwheels for no apparent reason. They clad her in white and said 'there you go, we gave you your own movie and genderswitched it so contractual obligation resolved.'... and audiences paid the price.."
218,5,Boring While watching this movie I never felt that it wasn't a bad movie but for the widely acclaimed hottest MCU character Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) this movie wasn't anything spectacular. I feel that the story was kind of slow and dragged on a bit with the main villain only showing up to be defeated almost immediately. The way the characters get kidnapped and then have to work together to get back to defeat the villain is something we've seen in many movies. All in all the movie was a decently fun watch as the action scenes were not bad but could have been way better.
219,5,"Natasha, don't slouch. My campaign to finish the MCU and get up-to-date has been a long and painful journey, Marvel's Black Widow not making it any easier along the way. We've encountered some pretty bad Marvel movies, but I think Black Widow definitely ranks among the top three for Most Disfigured Donut.It's not like I can point a finger and say ""that's the problem, right there officer"" - there are a multitude of issues that plague this film and make it a difficult one to watch (and later to recommend). While the core narrative is decent and invents unique challenges for the cast, the editing and dialogue feels very shallow and low quality. A lot of the CGI for this film looks shockingly poor, and with action at the center of the Tootsie Pop, Black Widow can't move forward with plastic visuals. What only makes this worse is shoddy writing for the characters - a great cast (most notably Florence Pugh with her catchy demeanor and strong emotional presentation) is reduced to ash with a lack of depth and connectivity. I frequently found myself saying ""so what?"" to almost every narrative element and decision made by the cast simply because there was nothing for me to latch onto and empathize with what I was seeing. And of course, there's a feel good ending (curse the soul who thought making audiences happy at the end of a movie was a good idea).The primary handicap for Black Widow is its lack of depth. There are Marvel films that pull you in with their cast and relatability, but this film has none of it. Combine it with poor editing and visuals, and you're left with a film with a fizzling existence. The only thing I can say is Florence Pugh's back must hurt from carrying this film, and the post-credits scene does some absolutely fantastic foreshadowing."
220,3,"Easily the weakest of the MCU so far. Plot is way too shallow. Twists completely unbelievable. The ""family"" angle is too strained and unreal. Acting is impeded by the silly dialog written. Thank god I didn't waste the ticket for a cinema. Highly disappointed.The ""spoiler alert"" is on but it's almost impossible to spoil this."
221,2,"Just Another gender Switch Movie Anyone else has noticed that Scarlett Johansson cannot act?She is also not exactly pretty so what gives?As for Disney, well marvel has been finished for years. They even made Thor into a stand up comic so based on all of this i give this filler episode a 2/10."
222,9,"EQUAL TO THE MALE The superhero/comic book based world of film is dominated by men. Comics were that way as well for decades. And then things changed, slowly. Wonder Woman became as important as Batman or Superman at DC. And in the Marvel Universe one woman stood out above the rest. That was Natasha Romanov, otherwise known as Black Widow. So when it came time to make movies based on Marvel comics it was a natural to include her.Scarlett Johansson first appeared as the character in IRON MAN 2 in 2010. After a participating in more films including 2012's THE AVENGERS, people thought they had seen the last of her with AVENGERS: ENDGAME. *spoiler alert* In that film she died in order to save the Universe. But comic book deaths are rarely permanent. Instead she was given the lead role in 2021's BLACK WIDOW, a prequel of sorts to show us where Romanov came from.The film opens in 1995 in a small town in Ohio. There two Russian sleeper agents, Alexi Shostakov (David Harbour) and Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), are rushed to escape after having stolen S. H. I. E. L. D. documents. Coming with them are the two small girls they were raising as their own for cover, two orphan girls named Natasha Romanov and Yelena Belova. When they arrive in Cuba the girls are taken from them by Gen. Dreykov (Ray Winstone) and sent the Red Room for training to become the super spies of Russia.Years pass. Shostakov, who was Russia's superhero the Red Guardian, has been imprisoned. Romanov has defected to S. H. I. E. L. D. after blowing up Dreykov's office, killing his daughter Antonia in the process. Taking place after the CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR film, the Sekovia Accords are now taking place requiring all superheroes to register. Romanov was against the accords and as such is now a wanted fugitive.Meanwhile Belova (Florence Pugh) has been trained as an agent too. On her most recent mission she is does with a compound that makes the Red Room's mind controlling gas neutralized. Able to think for herself for the first time in decades, she sends the vials of the antidote to Romanov in the hopes that she and the Avengers can locate the other Black Widow operatives and save them.The chances of that happening are ruined with Russia's newest super menace, Taskmaster, attacks Romanov trying to recover the vials. Romanov barely makes it out alive but using the clues she has from the container they were in she tracks down Belova to Budapest. Before the reunion between the two foster sisters can fully take place they are attacked by Taskmaster and the other Black Widows. They escape and plan on looking for the only person they think can help them: Shostakov.The only problem, if you recall, is that he's in prison. This leads to a prison break and his escape from the facility. Together again he's joyous but the girls are not quite so. They go looking for the original Black Widow, Vostokoff and find her just before this location too is under attack. All four are captured and the man behind it all as well as the identity of the Taskmaster is revealed. The next question is can Romanov stop this madman before he unleashes his wrath upon the world.The movie offers the best of what the Marvel Universe superhero films has to offer. Fast paced action, plenty of depth to the story, amazing effects and believable acting from all involved. This time though rather than go the typical route the film has more of a spy feel to it, a female James Bond perhaps. Between fighting skills and plenty of gadgets it sure feels that way.Johansson has made this role her own over the course of these films. Here she is given enough leeway to make the film about her finally. She's up to the challenge and makes everything Natasha Romanov do worthwhile. Harbour is over the top and gleefully so. Weisz is cool and that's what her character calls for. Pugh who is new to the Marvel Universe makes her character to interesting that you wonder if a sequel about her is in order. And Winstone is at his best as a beleaguered father who has the means and ways to set about a major case of revenge with tools best left to governments.The movie is plenty of fun and a welcome addition to the set of films involving the Marvel Universe. Most everyone will have a good time with this and those collecting the entire set will most likely pick this one up the day it is released. I know I plan on keeping this one on hand for a re-watch, it's that good."
223,6,"a love letter to Scarlett Johanson Scarlett, how is it you remain more beauty each day?How is it that you can hold an entire film with desprate screenplay?How is it dear beauty that you held your composure and did a fine job acting with the asinine family story?How come you haven't returned my calls?"
224,6,"Fair For the return of Marvel to the cinemas? Not half badFor Scarlett Johanssen's send off from the MCU? DisappointingShe does not get the stand out role of the movie as David Harbour and Florence Pugh steal the show! Characters that I would actually love to see return (Yelena Belova will be in the Hawkeye tv show! PS. Stick around for the credits scene)All in all, marvel fans should be happy that marvel is back in cinemas !!!!"
225,3,Worst marvel movie It it Horrible guys. Lol I don t even know how to Start in the first place. The script the dailogues the performance of the actors ... it is painful. Disney should Pay really well to Scarlet . It is her worst movie ever and her worst performance.
226,2,Boring I wanted to like this movie but yikes. I stopped it 20-30 mins into it. Incredibly boring and fell just flat. Just didn't feel engaged at all. Maybe it wasn't the right day who knows but this was a big disappointment.
227,4,"Most disappointing of the MCU I liked that this has strong female leads and that the idea of sisterhood and bringing down a bullying patriarchal bad guy and the system of manipulation over the women and girls but that aside, the whole story felt contrived and weak and there is something missing. This whole film is easily the most disappointing of the whole MCU. I love a bit of escapism but there was nothing to really lift it. I suspect that has something to do with the fact that writing Romanoff's story was a delayed box ticking exercise to put out a female lead Marvel blockbuster rather taking the time to write a solid story worthy of such a strong and gutsy character. Barely adequate. At least Captain Marvel delivers on every level but this was a bit of a damp squib."
228,1,"I was not expecting that I can only imagine that meeting where the creative director approved chopping a super model head (olga Kurylenko), burn it and attach it to a dude's body (The Taskmaster). Nice move Mr. Creative director!And that's the level of crap this movie delivers. Not to mention the super bland acting of Scarlettt Johansssson. She looks like she couldn't bother most of the movie. The script is bland as the look on her face.Might as well skip this one and watch the Falcon and The Winter soldier. Boring movie!"
229,1,"Funny!! This movie is an excellent joke.They hired excellent actors and crew members, but lost the scripts with original story.Then they hired the lamest team of wannabe writers to make up some story, and ended up with ""Atomic Widow and Captain America show""."
230,3,One long spring fight scene Another case of special effects over story. Tedious fight after fight after fight. Unsurvivable event after unsurvivable event. Predictable. Uninspiring.
231,2,Anyone notice that the black widow of Disney is wearing white? I mean how libera;l wussy are these people? And Scarlett Johansson may have a good name but she is liberal and not attractive. Cannot act her way out of shopping trolley.Good gracious Holy Trinity was I bored.
232,7,"Entertaining enough I was interested by how the movie started out, and as it kept going it started to fade in and out a little. It was a fun movie to watch, but in my opinion they kinda turned black Widow into Super Soldier, not really, but she does so much and takes such a beating sometimes that you'd think she isnt human, sometimes it just got to the point of being unbelievable, i know its a movie but i think it really could have benifited if Black Widow wasnt potrayed as being so invincible. That said i still had a good time watching it."
233,5,"Marvel chic flick How disappointed to see marvel choose a lessser marvel character into a chick flick., now I love marvel however black widow has no powers and is merely a great gymnast."
234,10,Black Widow My fav marvel film! Man the films are getting a lot less kid friendly (keep that in mind) but it's so good! The plot is so cool and epic and the outfits are so COOL! I am in love with the intro credits the song is so creepy in a great way.
235,7,"was surprised i enjoyed this I not a big marvel comic book film fan - but i gave this a go. I know nothing of the characters back story, but i found that didn't really matter, because on its own this is a good film.Good action, a decent story, and some good acting.Worth the watch... i think Marvel fans will be happy and people who just want to watch an action pic will also enjoy it."
236,2,"A Superhero Without Superpowers!! That was a really weak plot that would have worked as just a 30minute short film stretched into a movie. After the trailer everyone was expecting to see an action packed movie and there was none. Read that again: no action, no story and lame acting from someone who has no superpowers.Hey, have her disrobe or something!! Do something! I paid money for this."
237,9,"YEAH BABY!!! Finally! This has been my most fervently anticipated movie of the past 2 years, which could have handicapped it (high expectations can lead to disappointment). This movie, however, was everything I wanted, plus! Great storytelling, great action, great offbeat (or should I say on beat) humour. All the cast were on point. Welcome, Romanoffs, to the Avenger family! Great international locations and crews. I can't say enough about how good this movie was. Unsurprisingly, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10 and am so happy that movies of this caliber can be seen, once again, on the big screen! {Action, Adventure, Superheroes}"
238,10,"Amazing This movie was amazing. It tells of the story where Natasha and her sister Yelena go on to stop the Red Room, the place where they train girls to become assassins and killers amongst other things. Now this movie was amazing with lots of action and great acting. Scarlett Johansson played Black Widow amazingly and it was a truly great experience."
239,8,"Quite liked this Finally watched this . I knew it wasn't what everyone expected , or what she deserved . Its not so typical a marvel , more of a gateway that I rather enjoyed. There were a few things in the production that were too much . The Red room was over the top and I glazed over . The prison escape and parachute scene were great. I liked the dynamics with her family and the sister.The fights were good , the story was good , overall decent, it lacked a sort of grit throughout but had it in some areas . The action felt gratuitous towards the end and felt 'off ' with the pace of the whole movie.The actors were excellent and perfect in their roles, elevating the whole production. They did everything right that's for sure. (A bit of a Weinstein moment with the bad guy) There were just so many opportunities to make this truly badass , if felt sugarcoated . I imagine it's a fine line with the demographics being so diverse."
240,9,"Great movie! I am glad to hear that Scarlett Johansen won her lawsuit against Disney. She deserves to get paid for the views. With that being said, I loved this movie. Honestly though, Yelena was the best character. Though the end credit scene makes me laugh as a Midwestern, I disliked hearing how she is going to be an anti hero in the Hawkeye series. Yelena deserves better but I understand her character intentions, especially it is revealed that she is working with Val. I love how Val is played out and Val as a character would persuade Yelena that it was Clint that murdered Natasha even though she sacrificed herself in end game since Clint has a wife and kids (that scene was sad). Anyways, I honestly feel bad for Draco's daughter. She went through a lot but her character is played out well. Even Draco's because you get to see how messed up of a person he is. Would I like to have seen more character development from him? Yes. I wanted to see more of what makes Draco do the things he does. I wanted more motives. But, I guess that is ok nevertheless. It is still a great movie."
241,6,"Very good but sometimes too chaotic Lots of action in this movie. He was very good, but sometimes a bit too chaotic. It had a good storyline. Lots of science fiction and good fighters. Also humorous. A struggle against power."
242,3,Bad performance What bad acting by Scarlet. If it wasn't for Florence this would have been a 1 star. Florence was the only reason it was an okay movie. Plot is too predictable and special effects often out of cue.
243,3,"Boring I can handle a lot, but boring? No way. What a piece of garbage. The Black Widow deserved much better. I wanted to like it, I really did. The acting was wooden, the plot was nowhere to be found; even for Marvel."
244,3,"Overblown overproduced superhero movie once again This just proves that actors are overpaid for their performances in redundant superhero movies. It's time for something new. Actors do okay but it's not earth-shattering performances by any means. If you look close enough you can see all the mistakes and the goofs peppered throughout this film and studios are churning them out so quickly to make a buck off of film starving audiences. Okay to watch if there's nothing else on that's cerebral. It's just a waste of money and time. Needessly over violent. When I was a kid and read comic books they were fun these are not fun. In some cases, these overused plots are actually boring. So many good books out there and better stories but Hollywood keeps going back to the same old crap. This is not the best decade for good fresh entertainment."
245,5,"Mediocre at best The film was obviously shot a few years late. The action should go after Civil War. It doesn't make much sense like this, like it was filmed just to film it and make some money. Unfortunately, this can be seen because the film is not of good quality, everything is mediocre at best, the characters, the plot, and the worst part of the film were the bad guys for me. Pure filler film."
246,8,"Not bad, just released 5 years too late Along with Hawkeye, Black Widow is probably one of the least popular Avengers, I reckon mostly because of a lack of superpowers.In the first Avengers movie, they tried to give Black Widow a human touch; the only person able to connect with the Hulk. Sadly, this was short lived and Black Widow was turned into what she always was: a badass female assassin with guns.Is that bad? No it's not, but it's also no more than that, and (unfortunately?) this movie doesn't change any of it.If anything, this movie is a marketing ad for the new Hawkeye series, with perhaps a little too much screentime for Black Widow's ""sister"" Yelena.Florence Pugh nails her role, though, which is clearly better written than Black Widow's role in her own movie.Scarlett Johansson performs equally fine, but the writers really did her a disservice with what they gave her, in a movie that would have been way better suited to fit exactly where it plays out in the timeline.Making this 5 years later, when we all know what happened in Endgame, turns this into a tasty dessert that gets wasted because we're already full from the main course. A real shame.The movie itself is fine for what it is. It has a bit of everything you might expect from Marvel. The jokes, the action, good CGI; it's all there. Just not much of a villain.All in all: 7,5/10, rounding up to an 8."
247,7,"An ok movie..... Not the best MCU movie and not the worst, maybe if the movie was before Endgame it was something else. 10/10 for Pugh that steals the show and the best part of the movie in my opinion. She was more funny than the character that supossed to be funny, deffinetely i want to see her in the future!"
248,7,"Enjoyable and Rewatchable I got to be honest, it's a likable film, but it's not the greatest film ever made.Marvel Studios has put out hit after hit after hit for the past decade (excluding The Dark World and Iron Man 2). Now we finally get the movie we should have gotten back in Phase 1 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I always thought Black Widow worked better as a supporting character in the last two Captain America film's and the Avengers films. But then Scarlett Johansson proved me wrong. I thought Natasha was a great lead role in this film. Knowing that this takes place between the events of Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, it blends in very well. We get to find out how she got that nice vest with many pockets and why she dyed her hair blonde. The action and the effects were amazing.David Harbour and Florence Pugh as Aleksei aka The Red Guardian and Yelena Belova was the scene stealers. David Harbour was super funny in this as the Russian counterpart of Captain America while Florence was amazing as Yelena. Rachel Weicz was also a sight to see in this film as Melina, the mother of the group.My only complaints are how they totally botched the build up of Dreykov, portrayed by Ray Winstone, which was hyped up since the first Avengers film. I was excited to see Taskmaster in this film, hoping that it was gonna be Tony Masters from the comics, but to find out that it was Dreykov's daughter this entire time, which I didn't mind. Equality, right?! My only gripe about Taskmaster was that the character was totally underused. It felt like she was Dreykov's dog still attached to its leash. Thank God, there was no love interest in this film.But overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not the greatest and nowhere near a perfect film. But I would definitely watch it again. I had a great time with this film.Rating: 7/10."
249,6,"action is solid when present, but story felt forced; twists are predicable; excessive fixation on dramatic elements; Natasha is a side character Calling this an action flick almost feels like treason. While the action it has is very high octane and Avenger-ish, the scenes are scarce when compared to the thick melodrama, emphasized by an exaggerated sad music. Twista are abound once or twice and insane predictable for anyone with half a brain. Unfortunately I was looking forward to an origin story movie for Natasha Romanoff but instead we get a family drama with more focus on her ""little sister"" character and an allegory of the Patriarchy. The biggest saving grace, aside from the action when present, is the comedy scattered throughout, which, as in any Marvel movie, can be quite hit or miss, but in this one they mostly landed for me. I'm also a big fan of David Harbour, so that helped."
250,10,"Scarlett Johansson first marvel actress to produce and direct her own film. There's an added poignancy to the year-plus delay of Marvel's ""Black Widow,"" finally ending July 9th when the film will be in theaters and available for a premium charge on Disney+. And there's a palpable sense that this story would have felt a little delayed even in May 2020. After all, why did Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man get three standalone films before Natasha Romanoff got one? Fans complained long before the pandemic that it felt like Black Widow was getting pushed aside, only given her own adventure after the end of her story in ""Avengers: Endgame."" Director Cate Shortland's movie confirms that Black Widow could have carried her own flick ages ago. They seemed like a normal family, but 'mom' and 'dad' were really Russian spies, and the girls were only being prepped for their coming induction in a super soldier program back in the homeland. After an explosive opening, the credits for ""Black Widow"" reveal that Natasha and Yelena were turned from average girls to killing machines, separated when Romanoff murdered the head of the program, Dreykov (Ray Winstone), and destroyed his Red Room. Or did she??. Jump ahead to just after ""Captain America: Civil War,"" when Natasha is on the run from her own government, underground after violating the Sokovia Accords. While she's off the grid, she receives a package from Yelena, who is suffering through her own forced exile after discovering a substance that releases the Widows from their chemical subjugation. As with a lot of the MCU, the third act here gets a little cluttered and repetitive but then the film recovers with a remarkable final action sequence that sends characters and debris hurtling through the sky (an MCU staple but Shortland's choreography makes it feel urgent again). It's ultimately a film that works on its own terms, a long-delayed enriching of the story of a beloved character that will make her ultimate sacrifice in ""Avengers: Endgame"" feel even more powerful in hindsight. Every blockbuster this Summer is being touted as the sign that the world is back to normal-""Black Widow"" is more a reminder of what fans loved before it shifted off its axis."
251,1,"Natasha Romanov as bad as Beef Stroganoff! Far too many plot holes in this marvel caper than all marvel avenger franchise movies combined. Black widow falls several stories of a building but she gets up like superman without a scratch while her compatriots break bones and bleed. The fact that none of the lead female characters do their own stunts so it does look incredibly fake. No Michelle Rodriguez(fast and the furious) style fighting here, just plain fake unrealistic action. Superhero movie? Far from it."
252,3,BORING This film is B-O-R-I-N-G AF! I barely even remember what happened except for the middle of the film where barely anything happened except for bad comedy between a reconnected family. Really boring and just... a lame Marvel movie.
253,1,another marvel film with bad... Why don't they hire real Russian actors or actresses?They did the same thing with Black Panther with the bad Korean...its a joke and just seems discriminating to my eyes when they over-stereotype a culture or country.
254,6,"An average film- that's about it The film was average. Worth your time for a watch but not as great as the majority of the other MCU films.The cast members were great. Scarlet Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz. 4 great actors who put on great performances. The story was quite boring and could've been more interesting and exciting. Direction was okay as was the music and actionNot much else to say about it."
255,6,"Natasha deserved far better. While I enjoyed my time with the film, I can't say I was thoroughly impressed. My expectations where that of a family-dynamic Winter Soldier. Instead the film doesn't lean hard enough on the espionage and consequences of Natasha's past. While the action can - at times- be well choreographed, the set pieces and moment to moment storytelling felt generic. I found myself predicting events before they unfolded. It could be because I've seen many films, or it could be because the scripts predictable. I, however, enjoyed the family dynamic the most; that's where the film shines. I also have to commend Harbour and Pugh. Their performances stood out to me."
256,8,"Strong Female Lead, Violent, Poor Story Line The movie's action sequences are awesome, the movie lacks in story and character development. One more thing I'll like to say is that it feels like the movie was not able to give Black Widow a proper respect. Still, nice one to spend time on. Here's my rating on various parameters of the movie:Guide for Understanding The Parameters: 0 = Not even one bit Present, 1 = Very Little, 2 = Little, 3 = Not to much & not to little, 4 = Much, 5 = Very Much.Positive messages: 4, Positive Roles: 4, Violence & Action: 4, Adult Content: 1, Bad Language: 3, Consumerism: 0, Drinking, Drugs: 2. Overall: Nice.Hope you liked my review :)"
257,8,"Black Widow I love Marvel movies black widow is one of my favorite super heroes I enjoyed the fight scenes, the funny moments were great the action was there 8/10 a must see if you are a die hard marvel fan."
258,5,"100 million for this? Yes that's what Scarlett got paid for this. And it's boooooring, bbbboooring, BORING!I was expecting an action packed film, dynamic and with a comic book style visual narrative but the story is just boring. And why put Olga Kurylenko's head on a dude's body? Task Master suit looks cheap and her mask is just trash. Looking at a deformed Olga on a dude's body is the worst thing I've seen on a movie ever.They ruined so many things on this movie. I used to love Scarlett as an actress but now I don't want ever watch a film of her again ever."
259,7,Black widow Hmmm one time watch movie. I think movie is good but story line for me is straight forward. There is nothing to explain in 150 words........................... . .. ......😑
260,2,"Director and actors out of their league. The Accents are horrible. Pugh especially has zero ability to keep it consistent. Extremely boring story. Fight scene to fight scene with zero soul. Not even women will enjoy this all women made movie. TV movie director needed to be replaced. She couldn't make this enjoyable or keep actors accountable. Scarlett is tired like an old dog. To think, she sued for more money. This would have bombed alongside other blockbusters, they did you a favor."
261,8,"I regret not seeing it in theaters. My biggest regret with this movie is not seeing it in the theater. In my mind Scarlett Johansson had every right to sue Disney over the streaming rights of this movie. The sound and special effects in this movie clearly separate it from the previous movies of Marvel past. This movie dives deep into the backstory of ""Black Widow"" something we only learned bits and pieces of during the progression of the Marvel story-line. This movie takes place after ""Civil War"" and answers a lot of questions between then and ""Infinity War"". The movie is action packed with some amazing fight scenes as well as heart felt. Actor David Harbour makes his Marvel Screen debut in this movie and his personality is seen very similar to that of what we see on ""Stranger Things"" he is the comedic relief in a more serious action movie. This movie themes around family, what it truly means to have one. An amazing film that is a must see for ANY Marvel fans out there. Of course your not a true Marvel fan if you don't stick around till the end of the credits."
262,9,"One of the Better Superhero Movies I actually enjoyed and watched this movie fully. Their was a decent plot, actual heart, great aspects of humor that didn't feel forced like a lot of the superhero movies usually do, and the fighting scenes were actually well done!I normally fast forward because they tend to be overly long and just boring. I get it - fighting, whoopdee do. But in this one the fighting scenes just felt right, were done well, actually carried the heart and plot, and not overly dramatized, or felt like they were dropped in just to have an action 'moment' like in most of the superhero movies.Great casting as well!"
263,5,"An ok kinda movie If you like a movie with background of a fire explotion and someone running in the foreground. This movie is full of that scene, one after another. I kind of find this movie okay.. Not great, not bad."
264,7,"Decent for a movie, Average for an MCU movie This movie was not bad, but wasn't great either. You would think that after being delayed so many times, the things added in post production, such as CGI would be amazing but it really wasn't. It didn't do the character Taskmaster justice. The large majority of the movie was carried by the Red Guardian and Yelena. Overall it is decent for a movie but average for an MCU movie."
265,2,"Not a good story I am normaly a huge fan of almost every movie I watch, but I really didn't like Black widow. I found the story not so fun. The action secenes were some good most bad and not much comedy was good. Taskmaster was a nice Character."
266,6,"Inconsistent with what's comes before. I finally watched Black Widow...Genuinely made me laugh and I enjoyed the family story and characters.I even cried at the dinner scene. Literal tears.However it was so frustrating because the movie would have made so much more sense if it came out before IW or even before EG.What also surprised me was the inconsistency marvel has had lately whenever they do any prequel stuff. In BW, BW is reunited with her fake family but by the end, she considers them real, ""I have two families."" - BW. But in EG, her entire character arc is that she has ONLY THE AVENGERS as her family and by sacrificing herself, it was the best thing she could do for them.This is very inconsistent and borderline a retcon or plot hole.It reminded me a lot of when Captain Marvel gave Fury more of a backstory and showed how stupidly he lost his eye 🙄🙄🙄🙄.Taskmaster was lame. Lame choice for his identity.The Red Room wasn't shown nearly as disturbing as it was hinted at in AOU and was just a floating sky base. Pretty milk toast stuff.Lastly, the movie just seems pointless. It wasn't THAT focused on BW herself. It even makes a joke at her funeral in the post credit scene. The film wasn't a swan song for her. EG did a better job at that than this film did. If it wasn't a swan song and it doesn't impact the world in any meaningful way...then what's the point at all??To just set up her sister??Sadly, at best, the film is nothing more than pointless filler, and at worst, it actually damages BW legacy rather than enhancing it.6/10."
267,7,"Such a poser! This was not what I expected at all, I expected more of a movie with insane action throughout the whole movie, but this was unexpected for sure. I think the movie was pretty good, it fills in a gap in the MCU, the scale of the movie isn't really that big, but that doesn't matter, it's not trying to be really big. The cast did a great job but Florence Pugh and David Harbour stood out to me. The movie was really funny and mostly because of the two actors I just mentioned, there was a lot of jokes like most marvel movies these days have, it was pretty fun but I think all the jokes kinda took away from some of the seriousness. I like funny scenes and jokes in movies, but not to many, it does depend on the movie, and also I don't like to many unnecessary cheesy dad jokes, so they could have let some of the jokes be, but David Harbour does play a dad so it makes sense for there to be some dad jokes. I also didn't like taskmaster to much, many people were excited to se who was under the mask and even do I hoped it wasn't just a robot this wasn't really a good plot twist. I will let it go since it kinda makes sense that it is the daughter of Dreykov but I would have liked it to stay true to the comics, also I would have liked if we found out he got away and we may se him another time, because the concept of the character is really cool, and it would be interesting to see him fight some of the other Avengers. Overall, great action ok plot, and some cool characters, so it's an ok but different Marvel film."
268,3,"the worst marvel so far.... Reasons: -storyline well below mediocrevisuals, a few good ones, mostly mediocre-Scarlett is really done with the role and acted accordingly -other actors just bland or uninteresting -another potentially great villain changed and destroyed -mostly Russian accent, often sounds just fake, made it difficult to listen (maybe better if you are a native speaker)Overall, for me the worst one in the MCU so far."
269,5,"I was expecting better Not that it's worth going to the movies, but not even to the projector. A movie watching on a strong TV. It's almost a comedy. They couldn't get much out of it."
270,2,"Almost unwatchable Of all the MCU movies, it's the most recent. That's about the only good thing I can say about it.The story is unnecessary to anyone's understanding of the MCU. There is nothing compelling in the story line and there doesn't seem to be any point.The plot vaccinates between incomprehensible and cliche. The direction is predictable and not in a good way and the acting - wait - there wasn't any.On the good side, a lot of stuff blew up.I'd like to have my 2 hours back. Whatever I would have used them for would have been better."
271,7,"Girl Power Black Widow serves up enough thrills, action and eye-popping visual effects plus a bonus trio of Oscar-nominated female leads - Scarlet, Florence and Rachel. Somehow it falls short of the consistency we have come to expect from an MCU production - no thanks to a poorly cast villain and a disclosed ending - i.e. Black Widow's demise."
272,3,I was expecting better After all the hype around the movie and really enjoying the character in previous movies I was expecting more. A could chunk of the scenes were a direct rip off of James Bond car chases and Kung Foo Movies leaving little for character development. I don't think this movie had an original thought in the plot as the plot seems to be ripped off from other movies. The acting was good given what they had to work with.
273,2,"Now we know why torrents were invented This movie and Disney sequels are the reason illegal torrents exist. I mean, who would knowingly pay money for it? I know it was a franchise film and one cannot expect anything, but I shall not get the hours of my life back. And stop casting Disney (so-called) Marvel 'actresses.'Message to ThomDerd: Your reviews hopefully get deleted because you are a spammer with 100 accounts voting for yourself - get out of mommy's basement and go for a walk so you can lose weight."
274,7,Not that good I love the character of black widow but i feel that the movie can be better and less boring. When i was watching it i thought that im seeing a serie. One of the best things for me is Florence (Yelena) i love his character and i think that has a great future in marvel.
275,8,"Scarlett Johansson gets the solo movie she should have gotten years ago. This superhero spy-thriller delivers an exciting adventure with a strong final appearance by Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow.She's joined by her 'family' of former Soviet spies that includes Iron Maiden (Weisz); the Red Guardian (Harbour); and her adoptive sibling Yelena Belova (Pugh). Their mission is to track down and stop the treacherous Russian general (Ray Winstone) who commands the Red Room: an elite legion of brainwashed assassins that do his bidding. Complicating things is the fact that Black Widow is a fugitive from the Americans (led by William Hurt who returns as Secretary Ross). More worrying is that the quartet face opposition from the Red Room's top enforcer known only as Taskmaster, a hardened killer that can practice perfect muscle memory.Scarlett Johansson is quite good in this. It's probably her best outing as Natasha Romanoff since Captain America: the Winter Soldier. She's actually allowed to act and emote a wider range than what we've usually seen.Her relationship with her former group of comrades is actually quite compelling. Arguably the better acted moments are when it calls for real family drama and unresolved tension between her and this ersatz family of secret agents. In an ordinary drama, you'd recognize each character as such: Rachel Weisz is the detached but devoted mother; David Harbour is the boastful but loving father; and Florence Pugh is the resentful yet nostalgic younger sister. It's really quite engaging seeing them sort it out amidst all the gunplay and stuntwork.Speaking of which, the action is pretty spectacular for what is arguably a 'smaller' movie in the MCU framework in terms of scale. A well staged chase between a motorcycle and an armored car is very tense. There's a cool prison escape by helicopter while an avalanche is happening. The fight combat is pretty well done. Much of it reminded me of Captain America: Civil War. There's even a showdown onboard an aerial military installation.The action scenes are excellent and the family dynamic between Black Widow and her costars is very good. If there is a complaint that is worth mentioning, it's the villain really isn't that interesting. His plan is actually cool for its simplicity (brainwashed female assassins) but Ray Winstone is not onscreen for very long and doesn't leave much impression. I mean, you want him to get his ass kicked but nothing else is there.Despite that, I have to say that Black Widow really surprised me. Particularly after all the hullabaloo about Scarlett Johansson suing Disney putting a damper on things. But it is definitely one of the MCU's better solo movies in a while. It's too bad she couldn't have gotten a trilogy of her own. But this will do."
276,1,"How are people rating this any more than 5?!?!? It retcons entire history of Natasha Romanoff, making her act completely different to her past appearances, absolutely stupid decisions are made throughout the movie by the characters - this deserves nothing more than a 4. The MCU is dead, it died with Tony and Cap, everything else is a cheap knockoff."
277,6,"Why wasn't she given a movie back in 2011 or 2012? After all these years, Black Widow finally gets her own standalone movie and... it's okay. I actually found Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz to be entertaining additions, but the story felt cobbled together and it was riddled with plot holes. I know Natasha is a very skilled assassin, for instance, but she's almost invulnerable in this. It probably would have been better to give Black Widow her solo film a year or two after Iron Man 2 came out."
278,6,"Unnecessary but still enjoyable, although not in the best of ways Black Widow is an unnecessary film, and everyone who has watched Avengers: Endgame knows why. Despite being flawed by a weak plot that relies heavily on its action sequences, it suceeds, albeit not much, when the relationships between the main characters take the spotlight. The film starts great with a dark undertone, but it rapidly turns into a very formulaic story with a forgettable antagonist and a heavy action-packed third act that leaves the viewer with nothing more than a sense of disappointment."
279,3,"Reality is a bit overpowering compared to this film She wants to get back at the powers that be. That sounds good in theory, but the reality is that you win at all costs. You do whatever is required. It is dark. It is cold. It is at the expense of lives. It is at the expense of your feelings. It is at the entire expense of yourself. Period.No matter what it does to you as the protagonist, your emotions are forfeit. There is only the mission. If you want to cry about it, maybe you shouldn't have participated in the first place. Maybe that is the fault of your parents or whatever, but that changes the facts in no way whatsoever.War is hell. Welcome to reality. Pretty much everyone understands that from birth. And don't be naïve, everything is war."
280,2,"This movie made we wonder what the plays at the fall of Rome were like They say they have bread and circuses; I think this movie would fit along. Lazy plot development, boring action scenes that are completely unbelievable and made up of low effort cgi. Pure spectacle with zero substance. These movies get progressively worse when I have seen them throughout the years hopefully they can drain these and other franchises for the next several decades!!!"
281,9,"Great ending and set up A beautiful farewell to Natasha and a great entrance for Yelena. Wonderful fight scenes and amazing female empowerment. Truthfully, I would say this is one of my top Marvel solo films."
282,6,"Mediocre, boring, but not bad The movie was just not it. It was ok character wise and the movie felt rushed. The villain reveal was really bad tho. I hope marvel stand-alone movies will be better."
283,6,"Sometimes Marvel needs to stop and think This movie was ok until it simply became ridiculous and turned into absolute drivel. One major question I had at the end of this was: why do things start exploding at all levels of the flying base just because a turbine gets broken at the very bottom of the base? Perhaps that one turbine propeller thing was somehow connected to a vast array of incendiary devices.It was sort of like watching the Death Star get taken down with one shot, except the Death Star thing was over 40 years ago and Marvel really should've come up with a better idea. I gave this movie a 6 but until the whole turbine thing happened I was probably thinking a 7 was appropriate. At best."
284,4,"Really? Could not finish watching . Ok I tried to watch this movie , but could not finish it. Sorry Marvel. I tried. Also 150 why such an arbitrary number ? Blah blah blah ."
285,4,"Um...Yeah...No I'm not a Marvel fan, so maybe that's my problem. At the same time I didn't go in with any preconceived notions of what these characters should be like, and only developed an opinion on what I expected from them based on what this one film was telling me and was very disappointed to find out it lied to me at every turn. The family stuff is only a front for the completely nonsensical plot this film has. The only thing that puts the two sisters together is illogical choices and huge amounts of plot armor. The main character is wanted for some crimes that are talked about on the radio and that have her heading to a safe house. Yet, when the plot of this movie kicks in, she behaves like she doesn't have anything to worry about because she doesn't know anything about what her sister is involved in. Fortunately, everyone who want her for whatever reasons that deal with her specifically keep their distance, and the only danger to her is from the people who are after her sister, allowing her to just travel all over the place and only get attacked by her sister's enemies. While I do get the sense that she and her sister are top-notch fighters, I thought they were humans. Actually, I looked it up and they are. And, yet, the insane amount of damage they survive turns the actions scenes into a joke and the villain, who makes a very impressive entrance, ends up being defanged rather early due to not being able to cause any sort of damage to these indestructible heroes. And it's not for lack of missing the target. I think Natasha alone gets blown up at least twice, her sister at least once, while also falling from insane heights, thrown around like rag dolls, and sprayed with bullets. Meanwhile, from what I can see, the younger sister has the means to create an army of ""sisters"" with the MacGuffin. The woman who had the MacGuffin even told her to do that. The only reason her and Natasha team up is to bolt Black Widow onto the story when, in fact, as intelligent as these women are presented, neither Natasha or Yelena would have made the choices they did to team up. And if they had, they would have been killed or captured long before they could even lay eyes on each other. Not to mention that the Black Widows as a whole have the rather unfortunate habit of just announcing their presence in the most loud and destructive ways possible wherever they go. They should be plastered all over the front page of every major newspaper in the world. And, finally, there's a reason this movie is more popular among females. Well, I'm a female and I have your back, males. No one is sexist who complains about these super heroes. The movie just forgot to tell anyone that these super heroes may be female, but not they're not female humans, no matter what they say."
286,6,"Not a Black Widow Movie I was excited to watch blackwidow only to be disappointed when i realised it was not a blackwidow movie. She is a secondary character in her own movie. I dont mind character building and i encourage it. I am just sad this was her last outing and yet she was sacrificed for a character that will be later built on. I feel like this was abit of false advertising.Also, there is a reveal that serves nothing more than shock value. That reveal ruined the character for me. Gender swapping is a pandemic that is starting to have me worried about phase 4."
287,1,"This film is bad and Marvel did ScarJo dirty This film is bad and shows how much Marvel didn't care about Black Widow's character or ScarJo's legacy in the MCU. It was an afterthought and apology tour from the producers after Endgame...and a bad one at that. It is ironic that it ended with ScarJo suing the company and settling for what little profits the film made. Another failed film in the Phase 4 of the ""M-She-U."" We should've gotten Hawkeye and Black Widow's story about what happened in Budapest. Not the fake family drama and female oppression story. ScarJo is still objectified in this film despite her renouncing her previous objectifications in her younger years as an actress. Florence Pugh is good with what she was given in a bad script and worse story. The other supporting cast are wasted and inconsistent characters that just push a choppy narrative and plot along. The villain is boring and lame...he is basically a Russian version of Harvey Weinstein. The third act ScarJo and her other family blow up the Red Room patriarchy in the sky and fight a female Taskmaster, who was played by a male stunt actor. It is more ridiculous than it sounds."
288,10,Amazing film! Definitely one of my top favorites in the mcu!But taskmaster was a little disappointing but the fight scenes and the characters were amazing and the post credit scene was AWESOMEEE.
289,5,Ok Black widow movie is amazing and nice or interesting.You are like super hero movie you like it but need little bit good story my view movie is ok.I give only five star.
290,9,"One of the few that is good all the way through I have to say, I am a fan of the marvel movies, for the most part they are good if not spectacular at points, however only a couple are good all the way through. Most although spectacular have sections that are for the lack of a better way to put it, poorly thought out, choppy and or boring. Black Widow is one of the couple that hold the story, action and entertainment solidly throughout. Has easily moved into my favorite of them all so far."
291,3,Past burnout It was ok. Granted it was the best comic book movie since Black Panther or the first Wonder Woman (the second one wasn't very good). But I'm so effing tired of comic book movies. If they would make one movie every 3-4 years maybe they wouldn't get old. All these movies have the same plot and the same scenes over and over.
292,6,"Booooooring! First, why do you make a movie AFTER you've killed a character? Nat deserved better, before she was killed off.The movie was dumb! The only tiny spark was the sister. Hope to see her in future Marvel movies."
293,6,"Slow down, movie - Also, women. Lots and lots of women Rushing action scenes from start till end, with only very few moments to breathe. The origin story of Black Widow is somehow both decent, but at the same time a bit disappointing. I had hoped for a movie explaining how Natasha became Black Widow and while *that* subject is mentioned or even referenced, it's in no shape or form the focus of this movie - The focus is a new enemy, a new undercover organization, and a whole new conflict. There's suddenly a family we've never heard about or seen, and it all just feels a bit disjointed from the rest of the MCU.While the action is great, the movie itself is somewhat mediocre, with a few things that annoyed me, while I watched it:1. Mind control isn't the opposite of free will (Movies always use this cliche).2. Every single character in this movie is female - Besides the comical relief-dad, the bad guy, the spy guy helping Natasha (who's in the movie for a total of maybe 5 mins), all the masked henchmen, and Ross (who's in the movie, also, just for 5 mins). That leaves every single name-given or important character, except for 4, being female. We're talking about a 90% or so female cast, of important characters.I'm not even exaturating here - Literally every single important character is female... Why do the bad guy only recruit girls? Why are only girls ""an expendable ressource"". The amount of boys and girls in the world are about equal, no? Why are girls worth less? Simply nonsensicle.The whole thing came across as it was trying to make a political statement - A very forced and distracting political statement (in an action movie of all things). I don't mind a mainly female cast, or a kickass strong female lead - Quite the opposite, in fact. So that's not the issue. The issue is that the reasoning given in the movie, didn't make sense in the given context. If you have a ressource (Kids), why on earth would you only utilize half of it (girls), and throw the other half away (boys)?3. As already mentioned, I felt the plot was way off compared to what I expected. Would had LOVED to had seen how Natasha was recruited and trained. What was it like for her to learn to kill? Manipulate? Steal? Disguise? Become a spy? An assassin? An agent? The internal struggle she would have to overcome? What did it do to her as a person? How did she cope with all these things, when she couldn't really tell anyone about what she was going through? And, of course, the person forcing her to do all these things could then be the bad guy. Huge missed oppotunity imho.4. Some of the jokes were very... odd. The whole commentary from the sister (who I generally liked), who had this running ""joke"" about critising ""the super hero landing"" (as Deadpool would call it). It wasn't funny, and it seemed like an awkward way for the movie to try and be self-aware, somehow. It just didn't work. Neither did the humor with the dad (any of it). A few of the jokes got a chuckle of out me, though - So it wasn't all bad. In general, there was a lot of humor is this movie, which I really wasn't a fan of. This was suppose to be a spy movie, more than a super hero movie. Now, I get you don't want to be too serious with a super hero movie, but seeing as Black Widow isn't a super hero, and that she is actually a spy and an agent, I felt the tone of the movie should had been closer to that of the Bourne movies, or even James Bond. Too much awkward and unfunny humor, for a character, who should be traumatized and lonely, more than anything.5. The movie also had a lot of very obvious so called ""twists"". A helmed person was introduced pretty early on, and immidiately I thought ""that is the sister"". This helmed person then later used a bow (just like hawkeye), and I though ""oh, its hawkeye. They wouldn't actually only have to have him in the movie when its revealed.... thats kinda lame"". Then by the end, when this helmed person shows up again, and Natasha starts talking with the badguy about his daughter, not one second passes and I think ""its the daughter....."". They try so hard to bait you the twist, and when its finally revealed who it is, it's the most meaningless character possible - Natasha already felt bad for what she did. This just felt unneccessary, both from a character development pov, but also from a twist-pov.6. This is the 3rd time Im editing this review (Sorry, IMDb-ppl!), because damn it, I really wanted to like this movie - but the more i think about it, the more it annoys me. So, another thing is there's A LOT of talk about ""the red room"". But we're never shown the red room, we're ever told what it really is, and by the end it's the source of all the problems for Natasha and her sister and she, as viewers, are still completely kept in the dark about what is really is. What the flying base by the end ""the red room""? If so, that's... just silly. Was the literal room where all the girls stood being mindcontrolled the red room? If so, whats so scary about an empty room with red lights? The whole thing is just a giant case of ""tell, don't show"", which is the exact opposite of what you want. In fact, its not even that, because we're barely even told what the red room is, just that its evil, the bad guy is in charge, and that there's mindcontrol involved now, somehow (even though that wasn't the problem when Natasha and her sister her little - what was so scary about the red room, then?).All in all, a bit run of the mill action movie, so don't expect to be blown away by it, as it is sadly pretty mediocre, overall. I'd say it's actually one of the worst MCU movies. Down there with Antman 2, Thor 2: The Dark World, and Iron Man 3. If I had to sum it up in just 3 words, they would be: Generic, disappoiting, and miscalculated. Really wish it had been better, as I love Black Widow, as a character. Defintely one of my favorites from the MCU."
294,6,"Dull, poorly acted, predictable. Pugh is the star here. She absolutely shines compared to Johansson.Black widow should be full of non stop action and awesome fight scenes, not dull, monotonous chat.In the other MCU movies, Black Widow is portrayed as an almost unstoppable, highly trained and efficient assassin. In this movie she's portrayed as a useless old model of assassin being replaced by better versions of herself.The woman who kicked the ass of three armed men whilst tied to a chair... Runs away and talks about her feelings.. Scarjo can leave the MCU now, boring and not worth the money."
295,1,"Integrity Johansson in a free fall to nothing... This piece of souless entertainment.......:Johansson in free fall that seems toremov her permanently from her acting talentoffensive to character developmentHumor as a hopeless attempt, not emerging from the situation,Insulting Russia because that's the current bogeyman; shamefully depending on financers,Abusing 'Me too', because femininity is not put in its rightful power, but idressed up as a man, hence insulting women,Bad, and even desperately confused, acting,,Etc etc....Shame, Scarlet.Return to your soul as an actor.PS: what the hell do Hurt and Weisz is this poppetshow?"
296,1,"Another mcu disaster Dizznay, you are the last one I'll come to for moral education. You keep your PC talk to yourself and don't shove propaganda via your lame movies. Most people don't like it and we don't need you to tell us how to lead our lives. Make an entertaining movie, take your money and off you go, keep your schooling to yourself.Haha, and now we hav Miss Widow n Dizznay havin a crack at each other. Goodluck, not with the lawsuits."
297,8,"Better than I expected Pretty much what you'd expect from Marvel.CGI is pretty good, script has humour. Florence Pugh steals this movie outright from under every other participants nose."
298,5,It's ok It's ok and gives a lot of background but it is boring and just sets up another movie. I probably will watch again in the future for the proposes of knowing as much as I can about Marvel.
299,4,"Eh Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, and David Harbour are about the only things enjoyable about this movie. Other then that it was boring as hell. Movie was pointless and the only part that actually could've been interesting they played a montage over it and had a bad cover of Nirvana along with it."
300,4,Boring Love Marvel and Scarlet but this movie was so boring.!! Not a movie we needed. Not worth seeing. Look forward to other marvel movies that hopefully have more to it than this.
301,8,"What kid had blue hair in 1995? Is she in the credits as Big Girl?Oh s@&;! Dad has surprising strength.Am I going to have to watch Stranger Dats to k me dad's not a jerk.""I was gonna start talking about fallopian tubes"" :)I thought the red room was in NYC."
302,8,What's with the 5 page dissertation reviews??? There's always somebody with a long review but wow this takes the cake... it's full of them...nobody wants to read your long reviews which are a pathetic attempt at playing your fantasy role as a professional critic... Get over yourselves!!!
303,6,"Should have been 3 movies. The movie is ok but storytelling wasn't great. It fills in some gaps but something is still missing. It felt like part of her story was missing even though they did the opening montage and gave us pieces of her story in Age of Ultron. What they should have done was one movie showing her childhood in the Red Room and her early Black Widow days, then another movie with her meeting Clint & proving herself to Nick Fury, then this one. Then it would have felt like her story was done justice."
304,7,"Could have been better The story is there, the actors are there, but it just didn't hit the mark that Marvel usually hits. Changes in characters and plot holes didn't help much either. I enjoyed it better knowing I didn't pay the premium fee for this."
305,5,"Not the best Marvel movie Scarlet Johansson was great as usual!! So was Florence Pugh. Both were beautiful and with great performances. But the movie, the story and direction was not as good as a Marvel Universe movie deserves."
306,4,"A Hanna Montana history told by the Marvel Universe Due the lack of fresh ideas from Disney, prepare to watch the story of two outstanding female characters that will save the day with the help of a clumsy male character (that tries hard to be funny or has a role that is irrelevant for the story) showing that there is nothing most important than love, friendship and tell the world that women do not need to be saved.... Sounds familiar??? Yes it's the same script of Frozen 2, Hanna Montana, Girl meets world, Lizzie Macguire, even iCarly or victorious (which are not from Disney). Boring, Nothing new, A story that did not need a movie."
307,4,"Pretentious, hollow and without any charm It is a film whose only positive aspect is the first eight minutes. There are criteria to tell a story, generate suspense and allow the spectator to amaze. Then comes a series of clichés that, because they are repeated, tire more and more. Namely: the main character has debts with her past. Upon finding her past, she must heal the previous wounds. Later she will take revenge on those who negatively affected her. End of story. In this it is a film that pains the sentiment and the grossest manipulation of the viewer. For entertainment I can barely rescue anything; as a drama it is bad and at the plot level there is nothing that surpasses the mediocre."
308,6,"Florence is the star Florence Pugh is the only good thing here. And some action scenes. It is easy too long. Didn't really get on at any time.,.................. Even Scarlett is only ok. She is usually such a good actress. But poor script."
309,5,Just don't fit Hard to know at what point we are supposed to be interested in this movie. Slow and sillier than regular.Trying to force my way through the entire movie.
310,8,"Not sure why people didn't like this one. Finally watched Black Widow after it being out for a while. Honestly, I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure why there was so much hate.Sure, it didn't feel like a typical Marvel movie. There wasn't nearly the amount of superpowered action that we've gotten used to. It felt much more slow-paced and introspective. I supposed, then, I can see why it wasn't maybe what people were expecting.I thought that the movie feeling very different actually really aided it. It felt much less like a superhero movie and more like a fun and entertaining spy-thriller. The action was exciting and entertaining, and aesthetically it was very enjoyable as well. And I think the longer periods of introspection and thoughtfulness were a nice change from the usual breakneck pace of Marvel movies.It dealt with themes of family, both who you were raised with and found family. I loved how, instead of building up this super long, detailed explicit backstory for Black Widow and Yelena, we had to figure a lot of stuff out from just context clues. Sure, there was the intro scene (which I thought was very well written and fittingly confusing) but other than that we were left to fill in the gaps to imagine what exactly happened to Natasha and co. After that opening scene.Overall, what I really liked about this film was that it trusts its audience. Instead of having a whole lot of exposition and backstory, we are instead forced to consider what we know about the MCU and Natasha to fill in the plot. In reality, this story is the climax of a long story that has been Natasha's whole life.It was definitely a little slow in places. And of course, the villain was not that interesting. That's true of most MCU movies, though, so it's to be expected. At least they did a good job of making him more loathsome and hateable than some other Marvel villains.Ultimately, I am excited for where this movie takes the MCU. I hope to see more of these characters in the future.(this is more like a 7.5 for me but I rounded up)"
311,8,"The bad guys read the script When the bad guys always find the protagonists, no matter where they hide. I control my disdain by reminding myself that DC movies are based on COMICS. They can get away with anything!Ths movie was exellent entertainment, watched it twice."
312,6,"I Wanted to love it, but... I really was excited for this one. So keen to see her finally get what she deserved. But now I am kind of disappointed. This movie heavily depends on CGI. Like every marvel movie does. But they were really bad at some points. Which really took the edge of the movie. Also the Storytelling need some tuning. And the overall timing of when the movie was published was just wrong. It's really was missing the illusion of ""she might die"".So a solid 6 it is. Not more maybe less."
313,1,Wtf It tried to be like Jason Bourne with an action vibe and forgotten past but concentrated to much on a family aspect turning it in to the incredibles with boring gender swapped villains and unfunny characters and Florence Pugh ruined everything with her terrible acting as a boring yelena.
314,6,"Surprised how much I didn't like this. Looking forward to it. I like a lot of these origin stories, gives them room to breathe and Natasha has been a deeply under-served character for years despite casting Scarlett Johannson in the role. I guess it pays well because there hasn't been much acting.First off, it is WAY too much just another installment. More than maybe any other of the MCU, you really need to have seen many others, as it just dives right in. I know the background and still hate this. Films can be part of a universe but have to also be reasonably free-standing; I didn't take a week off work to bing all the previous films right before this.Way too much fighting and way too much of that was too-superheroey. Cars flipping and other Big Stunts when it's just a couple people running.DEEPLY underserved by the villains... again. Trite as can be secret villain boss man who we thought was killed and also a new level of supersoldier, who simply isn't that dangerous.Shakeycam, and other odd choices. Overall, vastly badly constructed. Plot and most dialogue that does not involve grunts and screams is a spy thriller, or maybe psychological drama. Then, action! And we're magically at the next set piece. That's it: it reminds me of 90s video games, where there's back story then you drive the little character around to fight zombies or solve the puzzle.That worked then, but only because you are driving the character and we had lower standards. In a film, the end result is boring, because it is un-engaging. Not sure what is going on, the goals, the consequences, and just... don't care."
315,5,"Vanilla, generic, meh.... It seems like that Disney had an idea for the 6 or 7 set pieces that litter the movie but no idea how to tie them together and make it funny, compelling or that there was any peril to any of the characters at any stage.Too little, too late with soooo many plot conveniences."
316,8,"Solid, really solid showing. Black widow finally gets her long overdue stand alone movie and although people were hoping for more of an origin story for her film this hits well and fills some gaps from her story and allows us to know Natasha Romanov better.It appears the vibe of 'Thor: Ragnarok' is the model the MCU is following now, just enough comedy during the boring parts to keep us interested which is fine. All in all the action scenes are great and the movie is well paced. The chemistry between black widow and her sister is fantastic and they bounce off each other well. I especially enjoyed her mocking the poses.It's also good to see more great actors in Rachel Weisz and Ray Winstone get a showing in the MCU.A great send off for the character in my opinion."
317,5,"A film about female but feels written by men I know this film is written at least partly by a woman and directed by a woman, but it so much victimizing and not empowering concerning women. Sure, the ""women are not treated equal and fair"" part could have been there but it should have had more examples of strong women that did not feel like it was trying too hard. Why include a elite squad of super sexy bad ass killers for example? And then have them all being controlled by a fat old man? And then when they are released they suddenly all become sisters? Why were there no men in the elite mind controlled squad? There were men soldiers but obviously men are evil so they did not need to mindcontrolled compared to the fragile good hearted persons that women are? I guess you get my point, it felt more like it were portraying women as fragile. I guess you could make the connection of breaking free of the patriarchy, sure...but it felt more forced than logical for the story of the film. The acting was okay and quality good, like any marvel installment."
318,8,"The fun and thrilling solo ride that Natasha Romanoff deserves Cate Shortland's 'Black Widow' is the fun and thrilling solo ride that Natasha Romanoff deserves. The plot itself is really quite silly, but the picture has the appropriate blend of drama and comedy, with Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz providing a compelling enough dynamic and carrying a straightforward spy narrative with decent emotional depth."
319,6,"A mixed bag with power levels all over the place. Wish Marvel would have taken more risks with this one First of all, this movie should have been released right after Civil War. It would have helped the movie tremendously since there is no actual danger or threat to Black Widow. Apart from that, they could have set up her sacrifice in Endgame with this movie and give it even more emotional weight, instead of having it as a marginalia overshadowed by Tony Starks sacrifice.Now to the movie itself. The first hour is disjointed, boring, even a little bit confusing at times (how did she get there? Why did she go there? How did she know she must go there? Etc.). The action is lackluster, illogical and everything just drags on and on and on and I was very close to just watch something else. I'm glad I didn't. The middle of the movie is extremely well written and very emotional (The ""family"" was well casted and I especially liked the character of Yelena. The dynamic between the two Black Widows was great) .This was by far the best part of the movie and the only part which actually worked brilliantly. Marvel should have gone the Logan route with this one and focus mainly on the emotional and character part (and keep the action grounded). Would have worked a lot better and I believe it would have given Scarlett Johansson the farewell from Marvel she actually deserved. The last part of the movie was okay but also quite generic. At this point we should also talk about the power levels. They are all over the place and highly illogical. Is Black Widow a normal trained person with skill or actually a superhuman? (Yes, I know the answer, but I get a feeling the makers of this film didn't). Black Widow should have been dead, crippled and unconscious more than once in this movie. Yes I'm aware this is fiction, but it was so blatantly ridiculous that it was hard to overlook. The action in itself is quite generic the whole movie. There are no real surprises.Overall I'm not sure if I can recomment Black Widow. If you are looking for great action then I guess look somewhere else, but if you want to know a little bit more about Natasha's past and about the character Black Widow itself and you don't mind watching generic action, then I can recommend this movie."
320,4,"Entirely predictable woke Disney girl-power piece Black Widow was dead to begin with.This being a prequel, and the character's fate already known, there's no peril here. So what does that leave? Action sequences that are by-the-numbers, some token character backfilling, fairly mundane performances by all the cast, and some cringe inducing politics.Johansson, it has to be said, is ageing and tired looking. We know that she can give nuanced performances, and is particularly strong at reactions, but as the lead is given no opportunity to do so here. Still, she has presence, and carries the film, barely.Florence Pugh bring a personable performance and some surprisingly appealing chunkiness. She also gets to deliver the only real humour, although the single joke is overplayed. Will she be able to carry the inevitable sequel? I'm not convinced, but Disney will ensure that we get to find out.Rachel Weisz gives her usual solid, reliable performance, and it's nice to see Hollywood casting female leads in their 50s.Ray Winstone hams it up decently as Baddie Baddisov in the couple of scenes that he gets, but he's only there to embody toxic masculinity.The over-rated David Harbour plays his usual fat bumbling slob, and provides some fairly tedious comic relief in scenes ripped off from the Incredibles, before (of course) getting smacked around by a girl.For that matter, the final action sequence is swiped from the start of Saints Row 3, and there's not a lot of originality to be found elsewhere.It rips along at a decent pace, and it's perfectly competent - but only competent. The score and sound effects are overblown, as is annoyingly common now.There's nothing fresh or surprising or brave or clever here. And the politics are so predictably in your face. Woman good, men bad or incompetent, of course. But casting half the widows as African-Russians is bizarre, delusional and jarring even by Hollywood standards.It's watchable enough, but it feels very contractual, a filler piece to close out the MCU and introduce a next generation of younger, cheaper talent."
321,7,"Good but awkwards spots It had a good plot that I didn't question. A good twist. Really good action. I feel bad giving it a 7 but there were a few points where I think they had the sisters go back and forth that I felt was a little awkward, and/or a slow spot or two. One fight scene that probably didn't need to happen. And technically I thinks it's a little off the Marvel universe timeline. Really entertaining movie though! I'd recommend. And watch again."
322,3,Worst Marvel movie by far Had to turn off half way through before having it play in the back ground whilst having a conversation with others. Over rated rubbish. The clichés of Hollywood are smashed together to make by far the worst marvel movie to date.
323,1,"This should not be Marvel Comparing to all other Marvel movies this is the worst.Story is poor, you know it just not fit Marvel story. Its not about blowing cars and the building or showing coool VFX if story is bad you not fill the movie. I think Stan Lee would be disappointed :/"
324,5,"Forgettable I literally don't remember anything from this movie. More formulaic marvel media. Not. Horrible, just not memorable. I would recommend watching this only if you were a huge marvel fan. Other viewers can skip this one."
325,6,"Scarlett is great... everything else is merely okay Scarlett is wonderful and I love her, everything else about the movie is merely okay Black widow is dumb enough to free task master to try to kill her again... everything else is just plain childish like the debris avoiding her...and the boring American story of ""russians are bad americans are good"" Repeating since rocky 2 Not bad,And I wish to see more of Scarlett Johansson."
326,1,"Deeply disturbing I'm stunned that this is a Disney movie. I found the context psychologically unsettling. A spy family with young children, stolen from their own families and raised by adults they thought were their parents, only to be ripped away at a young age to become violent assassins. The attempt to dissociate that grim reality, by throwing in woefully inept attempts at humor, tight leather suits, and unrealistically healthy young women, only serves to emphasize the damage that we're actually watching. I felt ill and would never let a young child or even a teen watch this film. It required too much energy to suspend disbelief that Natasha and Yelena weren't emotionally void and addicted to drugs to quell the psychic pain."
327,9,Great action movie Action packed from beginning to end with a plot that rivals some bond films. Highly recommended if you're even remotely a fan of the Marvel cinematic universe or espionage films in general.
328,6,"Average movie all-around If an average movie is a 5/10, this is probably a 6.It's really long with some exciting parts and some really boring parts. The plot is OK, but gets they sort of forget to give the movie a reason to exist.You don't really get anything about Black Widows past. You see her as a child, then her entire training is a short montage, and then suddenly it's post-Civil War where they force the plot to progress in a really unnatural way.I think they could've cut out a bunch of boring bits farther along in the movie and actually spent some time showing us Black Widows backstory, like they did with some other MCU characters.Special effects and fight scenes are on par with any other Marvel movie, so no complains there.In any case, it's entertaining enough."
329,6,Another winner Good pace. Good acting. Good effects. This is a solidly good movie. The Marvel movies are constantly above average. Never checked the time. My daughter never left the theater which is a real rarity. She all but ran to the restroom when the movie ended.
330,1,Trailer better than film It's so tragic that the best bits in this film are literally the bits shown in the trailer. Big disappointment.Also really kinda random I mean all these people we never even hear is before lolJokes.
331,8,"Better Late than Never Black Widow is about 7-8 years overdue as this should've happened post-winter soldier era MCU to me however, that doesn't diminish this film as a solid entry in a 25+ film saga and certainly one Scarlett Johansson deserved as a proper send off. Funny, action packed when it needs to be, and rewatchable Black Widow made it's mark on the genre this summer. I wish it would've done better at the box office.8.7/10."
332,4,"Not good at all Just saw this on Disney+ and have to say it's really bad. The storyline is poor, the acting at times really bad and the jokes are mainly not very funny. I think this film should have been made 5-10 years ago after the first Avengers movie came out like all the other standalones. Where it fits in the timeline is confusing and lots of it doesn't make much sense. I had really high hopes for this movie as Black Widow was one of my favourite characters but this was not good at all. It's probably time to just leave it be Marvel. You made some great movies (Iron Man, Thor, Civil War, Infinity War, Endgame).... Don't do a Simpsons and destroy your legacy."
333,3,Awful just awful I had decent expectations going in to this film a couple of months ago but wow it really is a disaster. Firstly this film really should have been phase 2 mcu and secondly it's so boring. The m she u ruins yet another iconic character like they did mysterio. This time instead of fish bowl head they change the gender of a great character and make it a boring 1 dimensional character who says nothing. This film is a straight up joke and is a perfect representation of how bad marvel is these days. The film May of been a 5 but it's awful rip off clone wars finale makes it a low 3 for me.
334,7,Scarlett Johansson perfect Great movie. Scarlett on top form as always I wouldnt say it's better than the Spiderman far from home But still up there as a good Marvel movie To be honest it's hard to follow the avengers infinity / end game ..Scarlett is holding her own as the black widow.
335,10,"Terrific! Best Marvel movie ever! This movie is fabulous! It has such great comedic effect, action and heart. The actors brought the characters to life. Yelena is the best character in the Marvel universe. So much fun. Non-stop entertainment. I can't wait for a sequel!!!"
336,7,"Entertaining but mildly disappointing My biggest concern is that it comes across as a rip off of Red Sparrow with less accomplished actors, way more action and dumb and confused storytelling.Otherwise I enjoyed it, mostly due to the two lead actors."
337,7,"Ordinary marvel movie I thought this movie is going to be extraordinary but but nothing about it felt extraordinary. Acting, casting was great but screenplay and action was very normal. Regardless of Taskmaster gender, I believed there were gonna a lot of individual action combat between Natasha and her. However i was amazed by Yelena's new target. Hope I see her soon."
338,8,Deserves more credit .. great chemistry between the actors I fell bad for this film I feel like it got a bad rap for really no reason. First off the cons of the film and mainly the big one is the lacklustre villain in the film. Now the pros the chemistry between the actors are great I would of loved to see them all in another film but we all know that won't happen. I feel that's mainly way the film is getting bad reviews Because they should of made this movie before avengers endgame because we all know the outcome. I think that was a bad move on marvel to wait so long.
339,3,"Pretty boring movie It was very confusing and boring. I actually fell asleep in the middle of the movie, which never happens to me! It was that boring... Acting is very mediocre, the characters are very superficial... This is by far the worst Marvel movie ever."
340,8,"I loved the part where I almost bled to death. Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Black Widow"" (PG-13 - 2021 - Blu)Genre: Fantasy/Comic My Score: 7.7Cast=10 Acting=6 Plot=8 Ending=9 Story=5 Imagine=8 Pace=8 F/X=9 Comic=7 Funny=7Natasha Romanoff confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises.""Great plan...I love the part where I almost bled to death."" This was a solid take on the Black Widow story, but the film's story left enough holes to drive through. I loved the cast here...great chemistry all around. After knowing what happened with Endgame, I didn't feel that invested in this one. I think above all else, the timing of when this was made was it's biggest negative."
341,8,"An enjoyable marvel watch! A solid marvel film mixing comedy with action and doing it well. Wanted more of taskmaster as it is such an iconic character however story moved along nicely without it. Character wise I really enjoyed the connection between Florence and Scarlett. For some reason Florences accent really annoyed me but I got over it after a while. A good marvel film that was 5-10 years too late, post credit scene is good not to be missed. For just over two hours this film flew by and it was because of how enjoyable of a watch it is for a character we have watched for over ten years!"
342,2,"One of the worst movies ever made (by Marvel) I'm just being honest here guys.I am so happy I did not go into theaters to watch this.If you're telling someone, that you are going to watch the new Marvel movie, what do you expect from the movie? Excellent CGI/Effects, Good and funny dialogue, Great Actors, Great Story, Soundtrack and a 2,5 hour movie that feels like a 1 hour movie because you love every second and the time goes by so fast.This movie is all of this, - but in the bad way.The dialogue is horrible. I mean come on. What did the writers think when they wrote this?I was shocked, because I love the funny but still honest kind of dialogue in marvel movies. But in this movie, the dialogue was not only just unfunny, but it was so cringe, that you couldn't even believe what they said. I've never seen something that bad and I am very sorry to say that about a marvel movie.The story is also really weird. I wouldn't call it bad, but I, personally, just didn't like it. Nothing really lead up and everything was kind of not fitting to the rest. I also felt like they tried too hard to make this a ""women power"" movie. Also: A big bad man who controls many women until they are set free? Did they want to make this a political statement? I am not sure and I did not like it.The actors picked for this movie... I don't know. Maybe it was the dialogue that ruined their honesty for me, but I am not buying their acting/roles.Music decision was also very cringe. They kind of tried to pick music that would've been in an Iron Man movie, but it just didn't fit.This movie also felt like it would never end.And the most shocking thing is the CGI/effects at the end of the movie. What the heck are you doing Marvel???? Marvel movies always had the best CGI on the market, but in the last 10 minutes of this movie.... jesus christ. If you want to know what I am talking about, just look at the scenes where Black Widow jumps out of the window and all the scenes where you can see her floating in the air (without her face shown). The lightning on her suit... did the internships do the effects of the last minutes or did you guys drink something???Never watching this movie again. This movie should just be forgotten. This is the first Marvel movie I am not watching a second time. (And I've watched all of them 6 times already, because they were so good.)"
343,7,"Slow start, overall a good movie I wasn't blown away but I liked the movie overall, even with the slow start. I think the casting was good, especially Florence Pugh, and there were some decently good action/fight scenes. The jail break scene was totally unrealistic but it is a Marvel movie, after all. If you want to continue the story line for the Marvel cast overall this is one not to miss. I've certainly seen some worse iterations of Marvel characters lately."
344,7,"Very strange is the result, not great, but interesting and fun. Very strange is the result of black widow. Marvel movies are not my cup of tea, but someone is very successful, like Iron Man, The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy. The other films of the saga very often fall into the very forgettable. We do not know how touches their subject in an interesting way, as was the case at times with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Black Window is on this point above, almost reaching the top of the basket, a story sometimes unexpected, sometimes unsurprising. A tribute to james bond femme fatale version, we feel the potential to touch strong subjects such as the abyss of destructive patriarchy. Yet full of good ideas, the film does not really manage to treat the whole and become a master stallion, whereas with a little more time and less unsightly spectacular, when the family reunites before the final confrontation, the film shows that he could have been very strong. Instead, he hovers over, gives compelling reasons to connect the pieces with the saga and ticks the boxes of the blockbuster marvel without conviction. This is how the film scuttles itself, not knowing how to take these distances with Avenger. In fact it's a bit of a mess, but at times it offers a real good time, special mention to Yelena Belova, actress Florence Pugh is really what we will remember."
345,4,"Very little action for a Marvel movie and terrible end credit scene. I wish this movie had MORE action to it, like I get the movie was based off of Natasha's Life, but Cmon, its marvel, was disappointed that there wasnt more action.As for the end credit scene, It makes me wish I never seen the movie specifically because Nat's sister is being lied to about the factor that Hawkeye killed Nat, even though WE ALL KNOW, that she sacrificed and if her sister truly knew, which she had better know come the next movie, that Hawkeye TRIED to stop and save her, he tried to sacrifice himself in endgame."
346,5,"Couldn't get through it. I just couldn't get through it... And that's says a lot because I usually love marvel movies. It was all so cringey. Not real background story, no real emotions just badass women fighting and showing some moves. All of a sudden they are on some sort of mission without us even knowing what's really going on. This is not the one for me, great idea horrible execution."
347,8,"Not a great movie but a fun one and a good time The character interactions are really what makes this movie, the plot is kind of paced weird and the villain is weak and under utilized but where the movie shines is it's action scenes and it's character interactions. And it's writing of female characters is the best to come out of marvel so far. I'd say defiantly watch."
348,10,"Woot! Didn't know I needed this Probably my favorite movie of 2021. Good sister relationship. Great dysfunctional family dynamic. Between this and WandaVision, I'm working through some family trauma this year! 😂"
349,8,Give it another chance I liked it the first time because I've been a Black Widow fan for so long. Watched it for the second time and love it! Great story! And I hope Yelena continues the Black Widow stories.
350,6,"Good cast but writing issues The cast did a great job. Scarlett Johansson was solid. Florence Plugh made a delightful little sister. I love Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour does the best he can with what he has been given.The problem is the story.The action scenes don't carry a lot of weight since the audience always knows that Natasha will live (Avengers: Infinity War comes later chronologically), so the sense of suspense needs to come from sources other than the protagonist being in peril. Unfortunately, the audience just gets a whole lot of sequences were Natasha really shouldn't have survived falling or wrecks but miraculously does - no idea how (plot armour?).The bigger issue is accountability. There are a couple of characters that have committed atrocities. One conveys no remorse whatsoever and the second abruptly has a change of heart after decades of knowingly committing crimes against humanity. After everything they've done and with no real reason to trust them, Black Widow not only trusts them but leaves them in charge of a bunch of highly vulnerable people. It feels out of character for Natasha and makes her seem foolish."
351,10,"Bring on the sequels! Awesome casting, acting, chemistry.Terrific script, directing, filming.So hope to see more of Natasha's family in upcoming Avenger movies.... Their scenes were perfection."
352,5,"Disney magic... ...that this movie somehow got a 6.8 IMDB rating.The acting was pretty good, and the characters kind of funny, but the plot was poorly explained, none of the characters were properly introduced, and you never really feel there is anything at stake. A bit too often the heroes rely on convenient plot-holes to progress the story, and even for a superhero movie, the ""action"" is a bit over the top.Can not recommend this movie to anyone."
353,9,"Awsome action movie Far away from what you see in the mcu but i love the movie, good action, good characters, good performances, for someone that likes action, thats the movie you can look rn, even if you dont watch marvel this could be something for you."
354,4,All men suck The story in this film goes like this - all men suck and woman are awesome and have to save the day . Men are lazy stupid obnoxious sleepy and are completely useless. We are there to crack unfunny jokes and look pathetic while females save the day.
355,1,"Worst marvel film ever! This has to be the worst marvel film ever made, even worse than the failing fantastic 4 films even worse than the DC movies, black widow is just a boring character, never liked her in avengers so this stand alone film was always going to be awful."
356,6,"A mixed bag! Without spoiling too much, the opening sequence is quite beautifully done with the opening titles taking place alongside a sinister cover of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit by Think Up Anger & Malia J. The score by Lorne Balfe (Lego Batman Movie) is unexpectedly haunting as well as wonderfully Marvel-esque 😁 and the use of American Pie by Don McLean is put to great emotional use in the family storyline at the centre of the movie. This integral storyline spearheaded by Johannson, Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz is performed so sweetly and directed greatly by Cate Shortland (Berlin Syndrome).The details of the Widows' indoctrination early in life are extremely dark but the film balances gritty realism and superhero adventure with mixed results. The antagonism is genuinely violent and menacing (led by Ray Winstone) making the threat to our titular hero all the more real and I was invested in the character we all know and love for the most part. However, the first half is pretty slow with too much uninteresting filler; the film could easily have had 30 minutes cut out which would've made it more impactful as a whole. But with emotional heft for all Marvel fans, an exciting last half and great performances all round, this is worth the watch 😊 stay seated for the awesome post credit scene too!"
357,5,"Average I waited a couple of days to write this review because I really wanted to like it I don't even know where to begin first off the film is called black widow this is her first and probably last ( considering the events in end game) solo film and yet she is basically just a supporting character don't get me wrong Florence Pue did an amazing job as expected however it seemed the film cared to much on setting up for her character to take up the mental rather than focusing on black widow herself another thing I hated the cheesy mind control plot line for the assassins of the red room (not a spoiler it's revealed in the opening act) and the fact that all the assassins of the red room are all called black widows so her super heroine name isn't even unique they could of done what kill bill did with different names like black mamba and copper head but I digress the biggest sin however of this film is TASKMASTER!! To quote the god father ""look how they massacred my boy"" if you are a fan of the character you will be severely disappointed in this portrayal if you know nothing about this character than you will still probably be severely disappointed for how they cop out with the conclusion of the character they establish the second biggest sin of the film is they revel an absolutely amazing gut punch character decision through a back flash but once again the film cops out and pulls it punches the only pro this film has is the family dynamic involving Natasha and the supporting cast in conclusion the film advertised itself as gritty spy thriller like the newer bond films but in reality it just comes off campy and cheesy like the classic bond films minus the charm just go back and rewatch winter soldier."
358,2,"Lots of issues While I was watching the movie, I realised why recently Martin Scorsese and other directors have come out and said Marvel is theme park entertainment and not movie or real art. There was no point of this movie, and there was nothing new to add in terms of story telling. It was mediocre at best. I know I will will get a lot of hate for this but I'm worried in near future we might stop getting really art movies because people only watch garbage."
359,6,"A mixed bag Black Widow can't make up its mind about what kind of film it's trying to be. It shifts quite abruptly from a family-friendly Jason Bourne knock-off to a parodic spy family comedy to a nonsensical cartoon plot. The beginning promises a generic and intense action movie which fails as soon as the protagonists display completely invincible durability, negating any tension. The second act is by far the best part of the film and brings together the family members back together. Great scenes like the prison escape sequence, Yelena's distraught longings for a family and the ramblings of Red Guardian really deepen the emotional core and relationships of the characters. The third act is mind-numbingly absurd as it escapes its grounded spy movie feel and transcends into traditional Marvel territory. Any pretense of hard-hitting action and emotion give way to overly obvious green-screening, unnecessary monologues, inexplicable sky fortresses, freefall fights and legions of girl drones controlling current events around the world. I'll take the sisterly banter and skip the mind-controlled pigs, please."
360,6,"Pugh + Harbour are magic! Braid city Wow there's a lot to talk about with this one. Let's start with the positives.David Harbour and Florence Pugh were absolutely PHENOMENAL in this movie. They both added some much-needed comic relief, stellar acting, and two of the best accents in the movie (sorry Rachel but what was that????). Florence Pugh's character, Yelena, finally fulfilled my life's dream of a female Marvel character wearing a practical outfit during action scenes! The white outfit was not skin-tight, not revealing, and not overly feminized. There was padding and protection on her joints and vulnerable areas, yet she still looked really good. Did I mention it wasn't skin-tight?! A+ in that regard. Not to mention her vest, which I loved as much as Yelena did. Even Natasha's outfits weren't hyper-sexualized, though they were very very tight. Hey, maybe that's her preference. I don't take too much issue with that, it was just really refreshing to see a female superhero in BAGGY PANTS!Another positive, as always with Marvel movies, the fight scenes were beautifully choreographed. The stunts looked great and the editing was great as well.On to the negatives. My main gripe with this action movie was that it was barely an action movie. I think there were maybe 4 action scenes in the whole movie. The majority of the two hours was spent on family drama and the repetitive mentions of having children, because that's all women care about, apparently. The idea behind the plot was good, and this was a huge chance for a female empowerment moment around freeing the widows and making a badass female assassin crew, but nope. A LOT of crying and a lot of hairstyle changes for no reason.Which brings me to my next point. The hair. I'm all for suspending my disbelief when it comes to superhero movies, but the hair in this movie irritated me to no end, and is the sole reason I'm writing this review. Why did every female character keep putting their hair in these ridiculously complicated braids?? Natasha, Yelena, and Melina kept switching from one over the top braided hairstyle to another, and half the widows had these crazy braided hairstyles, too. The dinner scene irritated me the most. When they're all seated at the table, Natasha has her hair down with two large braids on the left side of her head. Melina has her hair in this very complicated series of braids coiled all around the back of her head (which was beautifully done, by the way) with a whole bunch of visible small elastics. Yelena has her hair in a large halo-type braid. Flash forward to the next scene, after they've been ""captured"", and Natasha now has about a dozen small braids all wrapped fancily around a ponytail, Melina has a ponytail, and Yelena has two ponytails (or a half updo, I can't remember). WHEN DID THEY EACH HAVE THE TIME TO REDO THEIR HAIR???? I'm really bothered by this. Melina's hair alone would have taken at least ten minutes to undo, and her hair would have been incredibly curly once she did take it out. Yelena's hair also would have been way curlier than it was. Don't get me wrong, I really loved all the different hairstyles, and they were all done so well, but you expect me to believe that the doctors that were about to lobotomize Yelena took the time to undo her braid and put her hair in a ponytail? Sure. Also, when Nat was fighting on the ship, her hair was in several braids that were tied in a ponytail, then when they were on the ground again most of those braids were undone. Who took the braids out?Okay, I'm done ranting about hair. My final negative: the storytelling. Aside from the fact that this barely qualifies as an action movie in my opinion, my main issue with the story was that I was completely lost almost the whole time. A hero's first solo movie should be easy for a newcomer to follow. I've seen most Marvel movies and could barely follow this one. I don't see how anyone who hasn't seen at least half of the movies would be able to keep up, especially in the first half hour.Overall, not terrible. Great costuming and fight choreography, bad storytelling and frustrating hair."
361,1,"Generic and soulless money grab If you asked a fifth grader to come up with the plot for a spy movie, this is what they would have come up with. Another movie pumped out by Marvel just for the sake of it. Extremely forgettable. If I was on a flight and this was the only movie they had to watch, it would be only a slightly better option than starting a conversation with the stranger sitting next to me."
362,1,"Utter utter utter nonsense Dumbest thing in the marvel universe, and that's a low bar.This shear attempts to intellectualise this dumb cardboard universe totally misses target.Let pulp be pulp please."
363,8,"Better than I expected. I enjoyed this movie. It's a little clumsy at times, but I genuinely think this outrage towards the movie is ridiculous. It's pretty campy at some moments and requires you to suspend your disbelief, but the characters were surprisingly compelling. I really do like the dynamic of Natasha's family. Marvel movies tend to follow a formula and I don't think this deviated too much. With that being said, I knew what to expect and was actually kinda surprised. Not every joke works and sometimes you'll be asking ""why does everybody have a one liner prepared "" but just remembered you're watching a Marvel movie. Despite that, I laughed more than I thought. This element honestly worked in Black Widow's favor as a character, humanizing her and adding depth. This is not a back story , but it tells you what you need to know about her.Her character before this movie was generally pretty lackluster, even with the small moments that really worked for her. I think we could mostly agree her character was mostly one dimensional and came off as more of an obligation to a trope, rather than an autonomous human with personal motives and morals and goals. This movie changes that, even if you think Natasha is not that unique of a character (which I'd probably disagree with).The cinematography was different from most Marvel movies but in an honestly pretty stunning way, at least when it came to the lighting and the more ethereal nature shots. CGI was not amazing but it was pretty good.I gotta commend this movie for actually fleshing out Black Widow's character. I actually feel something for her now. Her story is honestly pretty cool and I did not expect the movie to get so violent and visceral but it did and it usually served the narrative. Some moments are just cheesy explosions that really only make you ask ""how is anyone still alive in this movie"" but you really just gotta suspend your disbelief, it is a superhero movie.This movie is pretty good, better than I expected. Way better than Captain Marvel in my opinion. I actually like Brie Larson but I gotta say, all of the main protaganists in this game give a killer performance and sold it a lot more compared to other Marvel movies. The movie wasnt perfect and there's a few things I'd change but I'm generally quite pleased. Definitely check it out, and be prepared for a little extra blood and stupid action-movie stuff like sniping on the wing of an airplane. Refreshing, and satisfying."
364,4,"Not Believable. At All. The Black Widow falls dozens of feet out of an office building window. As she's falling, Natasha is careening off of fire escapes and balconies. Result? One of her shins gets a boo boo.Her car blows up and then flips over. Result? She was out of breath.Natasha jumps from a floating & burning building that's a couple of miles up in the sky. Then, after falling a hundred feet, she manages to grab onto a piece of scaffolding to save herself. Result? Her shoes became untied.Oh, and get this: Earlier... Natasha is hanging out of a flying helicopter, while holding onto a rope with one hand. Well. She grabs onto a 280 pound man with her other hand, and hauls both she, and him, into the still-flying helicopter. Rest assured, they're both fine."
365,1,A total yaawn movie with bad acting lame CGI and confusing storyline This movie is for marvel donkeys who shove anything that marvel throws at them.A no brainer movie with stupid cgi and lost da plot kinda moments.. Don't waste your time at the cinemas.
366,1,"yet another nonsense boring marrrbell movie Put me to sleep, acting and CGI is lame as compared to other marvel work.Story is absolutely stupid, like you cant find the head and toe anywhere.. Yea sorta 1 time watch with most time spent on your phone."
367,7,"Decent superhero movie. As a stand alone superhero movie that doesn't draw too much on the extended Marvel universe the Black Widow does very well. There is a decent story from beginning to end. Which serves the purpose of explaining the origin of the Black windows. It also introduces the red guardian to the mix and although he's prominent in the film he's not so essential to plot. As many other superheros would have been in prior movies. However I felt his portrayal by David Habour was a fun take on the character.. If one wants to look at the bigger picturer. I feel that marvel is eventually going to jump the proverbial shark with regards to its superhero movies. The stories are going to get too convoluted, plot wholes are going to eventually appear. Simply installing more and more dangerous villans is going to get repetitive. Eventually will there be a villan that can eat entire galaxies? Stand alone narratives with a beginning middle and end usually appeals to me more and since this is a branch off the main Marvel movie trunk. I could enjoy it better than the Avengers movies. If you are looking for a fun superhero movie with decent accent, silly but funny one liners. Look no further."
368,6,"How bad is Ray Winston in this The first half of this film is actually pretty good , entertaining and a great show that you don't have to take an already mail established character like bond, and make a female version. This is a great female lead action film that is , up u til Ray pops up with his ridiculous Russian accent that sounds more like a cross between London , South Africa and Caribbean. He is awful in the role with very little actor ability and completely destroys the film. The ending and the ridiculous fight whilst falling from a massive helicopter is also a movie killer."
369,7,"She's Back!! What a great movie, idk why y'all hating this movie, this movie was really great i know in The Middle of The story It's Kinda boring when they meet they're mother, but there's so many epic scene, when they save they're father, ending scene when Yelena and Natasha fell, and when they are running from Taskmasker in the beginning of the film.The CGI was so good, you know there's a lot of CGI movie in pandemic was kinda bad cause they're use not much budget maybe cause black widow was filmed before pandemic. There's so much beautiful deleted sceneWell the ending scene when Natasha and Yelena fell from the Red Room that was so good, so epic. Hope Yelena will join the Avengers."
370,1,"Writing that makes Hannah Montana look like Amadeus Despite the terrible vfx (and complete lack of understanding of physics, planes, car accidents, and gravity in general), the writing is really the worst part. The directing is an abomination, and made worse by the fact that there was so much potential squandered. I really can't say more than I want those last two hours of my life back. I'm kind of thankful though--I was going to watch a bunch of films this week to get caught up on the new releases and this changed my mind. I think I need to do more with my life than watch expensive vanity projects by a certain rodent infested studio (the actors were great though lol)."
371,6,"Not Black Window Origin It was ok. Not what I was expecting for her story. It still left a lot unanswered. I would love to see a real origin movie for this character, as she is the best!"
372,2,"Marvel does Charlies Angels without the humor The kind reviews do not match the comments I have consistently heard from friends that are Marvel fans. This was a poor Marvel film despite the loyalist attempts to accept it. Marvel clearly has a biased fan base much like Star Trek or Star Wars. Their is nothing wrong in a film for the hard core believers. This film was a train wreck. Poorly written, bad story, long and slow plot that was confusing. The movie created more questions and confusion than it answered. Suspending disbelief was exhausting. Scarlett was upstaged by her sister played by Florence Pugh. Her sister was a better Black Widow...better actor...more range and depth to the melancholic Scarlett that cannot carry a movie. Note they kill Scarlett at the end. We learn there are thousands of Black Widows so replacing the dull Scarlett was clearly set in motion. Florence Pugh would be much better and give the character some needed charisma. The movie felt like a Disney attempt to merge the Avenger Black Widow as a Hannah with the new black widows as a Disney Charlies Angels. It ended up having none of the heart of Hannah or the parody of Charlies Angels. Only Charlie is a psychopath Russian. In the end, the movie never explains how the Black Widow escaped the Red Room...just did so get over it. If you liked this movie, there is nothing Marvel can ever do you will not like."
373,3,"...a feminist movie! ...just a feminist movie that can be resumed in a few words has a bunch of girls against their pimp!! We have submission, control, revenge, union and freedom...yep definitely a girls focused film!"
374,3,Very bad movie One of the worst movies the actor very nice in avengers but in this movie no need for all this movie as a scenario or acting.I don't like this movie at all waist of time.
375,7,"Only for hardcore fans? Somewhat confusing, if you're not a dedicated Avengers universe fan.As with several of the Avengers movies, I was somewhat confused for the first 45 minutes. You really need to know what happened in the previous Avengers movie - that is, in chronological order.One day I'll have to watch them all in just that - chronological order."
376,7,"Overlong but enjoyable adventure Fun mixture of humor and drama. David Harbour & Florence Pugh are great new additions to the MCU. Taskmasker is a disappointment though. Though it drags at times, Black Widow is a entertaining ride."
377,4,"Worst Marvel film until now I'm very disappointed because I like the character. But the story was very poor, full of logical flaws.The action was so exaggerated that it was boring to watch. Not worth watching."
378,6,"Romanoff's Back Story Comes Up Short This is not very good. It adds very little to the entire Marvel Universe and it is not a very good stand alone. I like Scarlett Johnansson and the character, but this is disappointing. The supporting cast is good but the overly comedic tone and poor script left me thinking how much better this could have been. The accents are horrible. This is poorly directed. The action and cinematography are ok but not enough to save this. The special effects are ""B"" grade at best. David Harbour made me laugh, for sure but this backstory has too much comedic throughline to buy the deeper, more intense moments. Robert Downey drops funny lines but if he made himself a clown the character would not work, in my opinion."
379,5,Not bad It's a shame Disney decided to breach Scarlett's contract since the whole movie left parts of her story out that could have been explored in future movies.
380,5,"Where is marvel? I was looking forward for Black Window! A hero with a great backstory to be told!All in all: plot weak, dialogs weaker, jokes hard to laugh. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't a marvelous marvel film either."
381,8,Shows more heart and less explosives than expected The vintage pop-rock song Bye Bye Miss American Pie is presented twice in two different ways.Early on it helps set the viewer in the past with old cars and old appliances.The second time it is sung 'acapella' and seems wistful and remorseful.Revealing much of the past by character narrative - a bold move for an action film - I believe there is a subtext regarding the fallen condition of the USA as an (unrealistic) ideal and the isolation we all know too well these days.I was impressed that the characters were filled out by reminiscing together - sometimes humorously.Much comment showing viewer incredulity in the bonds shown by four characters who were reportedly only together for 3 'plot' years is widely expressed.I feel that this shows a lapse in audience understanding.These characters have all been grotesquely institutionalized more than once in the narrative.These twisted souls have only this brief shallow experience to claim as a member of a family. The notion of family is addressed several times in different contexts.This is a particularly insightful examination of what membership and commitment are when both are less that what we all need.I was surprised that The House of Mouse did not screw this up. Well done!
382,10,STUNNING Movie!! This Movie Was keeping up to All my expectations and I loved watching it. I keep watching it over and over! It came way to late like many others said. Johansson deserved it way earlier but i am happy that it is finally there. This Movie deserves a much bettet rating! The fight scenes are AMAZING and I am absoultly in LOVE with them. Most of the cretic is not deserved in my opinion. I would defently recommend it to ppl who dont know any Marvel Movies as Well. GREAT JOB :)
383,5,"Disappointment I've been looking forward to this movie for quite some time now but wow what was this? It's not even the fact that it doesn't feel like a marvel movie, it's the fact that as a stand-alone, regardless of the marvel standard, this movie was awful.The accents were horrible, and I am genuinely tired of this Cold War trope. At least add a more authentic take to it, given it underpins much of the marvel cinematic franchise.In terms of technicalities, the plot was extremely shallow. Natasha's childhood was not well explained causing the relationship with her sister, Melinda and Alexei later in the film to appear out of place. In addition there was no build up to the villain nor some sort of anticipation as to what could happen if Dreykov isn't stopped.I mean dreykov as a villain was dry and his motive for why he does what he does was not made clear. I always believe that villains add to the story, so more often than not they need an equally good storyline and plots.The story with Taskmaster could have been so much better developed especially in terms of Natasha's past and her current turmoils. But that was washed down too. Not to mention the potential concept of what it meant to be a Widow.There was no build up or anticipation like in the first final avengers movie for e.g. In which we actually felt nervous whilst Thanos was collecting all the stones one by one.So in essence, I'm really bummed out by this movie unfortunately."
384,6,"Entertaining, action packed film Movie was good and gave back story of Black Widow. Plot filled in timeline of Black Widow leading up to blip. Good action and leave open ended in terms of more movies."
385,7,"Scarlett Johansson VS Skeletor The first MCU movie in a long time which delivers what is should as a comic book movie. A feelgood movie about coming together as a family and self discovery.While bringing forward some new and interesting characters/heroes into the MCU, it does fail at the villains portrayal. Unfortunately this movie uses your typical comic-book villain.Movie contains a lot of action without any boring moments but these sequences sometimes feel a bit doll and over the top. Unfortunately this is no Russo Brothers material like the Winter Soldier.In the end a movie that does not disappoint but will not impress either.Hopefully the story of Natasha Romanoff does not stop with this movie."
386,5,"I Feel Like a Widow I feel that after watching this Marvel have widowed me! This movie does not know what it wants to be or wants to say. The characters and timelines are confused and this origin / solo movie is years to late. Especially as it does not add to the original three phases at all. It supposedly takes place after Civil War and before Black Panther. Not only do we experience new characters that she has never mentioned before, but they are not that interesting or well developed / written.There was a little hope at the end when the general and his fleet of cars arrived to arrest Black Widow. Then for no reason before he reaches her the screen goes to black and it's weeks later. That makes no sense story wise. The writers coped out there and didn't know how to end the movie. More evidence that this movie was a poor production."
387,7,"Good, but Misrepresents Russia Either use a fictitious country or actual human rights violation for Russia. I'm not Russian, but this movie unfairly portrays Russia. It's a shame, because, this movie has great acting and well-developed characters. One of the best Marvel movies. We have enough problems with peace in the world we don't need to falsely accuse other countries."
388,4,"Better accents in an episode of Allo Allo Where to start?... I was hoping for a bit of background from this movie about what torture and despair these ""widows"" had been through. But the only discussion about having involuntary hysterectomies was made into a joke.A villain poorly introduced/developed with an accent more up in the air than his secret base.Terrible editing.Shocking continuity: you can't hear me in the helicopter without a headset on *takes headset off* all still converse easily.Taskmaster: what a waste and a pointless character to the whole filmThe only ounce of emotion I got from anyone was Pugh who is/was excellent. Everyone else just let her down."
389,1,"GOD AWFUL ABISMAL PIECE OF CRAP This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it is terrible, the characters(except Florence Pugh), the edgy and ridiculously stupid characters, the story was so brainlessly dumb and made no sense fiction or not. It relied all on music and action to try to be cool and like able for troglodytes. The movie was completely cringe worthy the whole way through and was just so terrible -99/10. (+1 for Florence Pugh)"
390,8,"Great film I loved this film but Christ Ray Winstones accent is terrible... all the other characters were great. Good comedy, action, tension, story & pace but Christ that accent... I just can't get past how bad it is."
391,8,"""You should have brought the Avengers' super-jet!"" Another par for the course entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That's not to be read as good or bad, it simply is. The film traces the background story of Natasha Romanoff, the Avengers' Black Widow, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson. Everyone in her childhood family has a different last name which all gets sorted out by the end of the picture, but if you're not familiar with the character, it might get confusing for a while. You won't see as much real estate destroyed in this story, which sets it apart from some other Marvel flicks. In fact most of the damage is confined to villain Dreykov's (Ray Winstone) Red Room, which is a bit of a misnomer once you get to see what that's all about. There is a 'world at stake' component to the movie, but that's mostly confined to the mind control aspect of all the 'widows' Dreykov has positioned in far flung corners of the globe. That facet of the story doesn't even get to play out, as most of the action involves Natasha and her 'sister' Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) joining forces to take down Dreykov, and restore free will to all the Widows under his spell. There's a fair amount of humor in the story, mostly understated, and most of it involving Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), father of our sister heroes. There's a running gag in the story, that quite frankly, I wondered how long it would take for one of the comic book movie franchises to deal with, and that's the whole idea of super-hero posing. You know what I'm talking about, the good guy (or gal) in question heroically drops from the sky with one knee to the ground, opposite fist planted squarely to the Earth, and holding the pose momentarily for the audience to marvel at (oops, no pun intended there). Pugh's character got that ball rolling and the script writers milked it for a couple more humorous scenes. You have to admit, it does look a bit pretentious, but at the same time, pretty cool as well. The after credits scene isn't really a big surprise, since we knew of Black Widow's ultimate fate with the finale of ""Avengers: End Game"". But if you didn't know or forgot, it might come as a bit of a shocker, as it points to a sequel of sorts with the ""Hawkeye"" mini-series due out later this year. And lest the movie itself reminds you of the kind of action that takes place in a James Bond film, you might consider that some of it's inspiration might have come from the 1979 film ""Moonraker"". It's what Natasha was watching on TV during an early scene of the movie."
392,3,"The worst Marvel movie to date. Weak story, Disney club acting, terrible dialogue. The Black widow is one of my favorite Marvel characters. I was so disappointed with this movie. So glad I did not waste my time and money watching this on the big screen. Free on Disney, however, I can never get that wasted time back. This is a terrible movie."
393,9,"ScarJo and Florence Pugh, who knew? This is the Black Widow movie we have all waited for, and while it lacked in some respects, it made it up in many others. Taking place between Civil War and Infinity Wars, it shows Natasha on the run for breaking the accord. The majority of the movie is spent with Natasha going after the organization that created her.It starts off with a flashback to when Natasha was a kid and gives us a very small look at her family life. Great job casting Mila Jovavich's daughter as the young Black Widow!Florence kinda outshone ScarJo in some scenes, but hey that is OK. If you are a Mavel fan, then you are sure to love this movie."
394,7,"Worth the wait...mostly It's well known that female-led superhero films are few are far between, the reason being that the usual punching, kicking, and occasional killing done by the gents just isn't possible when it comes to the girls due to their obvious lack of arms and legs. Of course not, in reality, the reason behind the lack of representation is much more complex and would make everyone a lot more uncomfortable than a good-old-fashioned dash of violence, that if we're all being honest isn't the behavior of a person who has dealt with their emotional issues and has a healthy relationship with their parents.After making her debut in Iron Man 2 way back in 2010, Black Widow sees Natasha Romanoff finally given her own solo movie. Where she is at long last given the chance to put on full display her incredible super-spy skills. Picking up after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Natasha finds herself on her own after Tony and Steve beat the living daylights out of each other, thereby leaving a bit of an awkward atmosphere at the Avengers compound. Oh yeah, also the government is also hunting her down. This then leads to Nat embark on a perilous mission where she ultimately returns to Russia where she reunites a bunch of colourful characters who are her only hope to save the day.Superhero movies are more common than ever nowadays, with every character no matter how obscure or outlandish being given their time to shine on the big screen, this inevitably leads to some being awesome genre-defining pieces of work, others becoming a laughingstock before they are even released and some being so utterly mediocre, they are forgotten as quickly as a MacGuffin.It is my genuine pleasure to report that Black Widow falls into the more positive side of that spectrum, delivering great action scenes, spectacle, engaging characters, and most impressively of all expands Natasha's story in interesting and unexpected ways.The film undoubtedly marks Scarlett Johansson's best performance within the titular role, with Natasha's backstory being delved into and expanded upon in ways that don't bog the film down and make it feel like a paint by numbers origin story that is so often case. Instead, we are treated to a pulse-pounding opening sequence that explores Nat's childhood and in this humble review's opinion remains one of the best sequences Marvel has produced in recent memory.On the run from her own government, Natasha's day then goes from bad to worse when a terrifying skull masked lunatic mercenary named Taskmaster is sent in pursuit of her. Whenever a man in a skull mask makes a b-line for you, you know he isn't there to talk politics, the weather, or even about that game last night that you defiantly didn't see. No, he's there to kill you; Taskmaster is no exception. The good news is his ability to copy his opponent's moves makes for some tense and creative fight scenes and when The Taskmaster is onscreen, he has a genuinely creepy present. However, much like so many Marvel baddies, his motivation fails to rally genuine empathy from the audience or deliver Saturday morning cartoon camp fun, much like Hela or The Red Skull did so well. No Taskmaster in my opinion was a serviceable but ultimately underwhelming presence in the movie, and a little bit of a let-down.The film has more in common with Captain America: The Winter Soldier than the cosmic carnage of the Avengers movies, and as a result can deliver tense and grounded fights, in which the oh so killable heroes must use all their skills, wits, and occasionally those electric stick baton things to survive. The fight scenes are a real highlight of the film and demonstrate more so than ever before why a woman with no superpowers not only deserves but has earned her place on the Avengers squad alongside patriotic super-soldiers and zappy-lightning gods.Marvel has delved more and more into the cosmic side of the Marvel universe in recent years with films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok, with great success delivering some of their best films. But Black Widow demonstrates that there is still a place in all that camp space-bound craziness for more grounded and realistic slices of this universe. Don't get me wrong, the film is by no means a Mike Leigh film, and requires you to suspend your disbelief like all superhero movies, but never in an insulting way that makes it feel like the film is wasting your time and it would be better spent repairing spider webs or cleaning the pennies at the bottom of the local park fountain.Obviously, Natasha shines throughout the movie, but the real surprise of the film is the supporting cast made up for new characters making their Marvel debut. David Harbour stars as Alexi Shostakov, aka The Red Guardian, a Russian Captain America knock-off with his own big shield and an even bigger ego. The Red Guardian injects a much-needed and well-balanced sense of humour into the film and delivers some of the film's biggest laughs. He's a fun larger than life character and it's clear that David is having a lot of fun playing him. In addition to The Red Guardian, Florence Pugh Black-Widow's-up into a leather onesie and dons a deadly pair of batons as Yelena Belova and is the biggest surprise of the movie. With one Black Widow already establish over the last decade Florence had the unenviable task of not only matching Natasha when it comes to the fisty cuff but also when it comes to the emotional scenes. However, Florence not only rises to the challenge, but she cements Yelena as one of the more interesting and complex characters the Marvel universe has seen, and I for one hope to see more of her.Black Widow may not have huge universe-altering ramifications for the rest of the Marvel franchise, but it doesn't need to, what could have been a tedious origin movie like we've seen so many times before is instead an action-packed thrill ride that may not change the genre forever, but it does change Natasha forever making her a more interesting and complex character."
395,2,"The ONLY reason this is rated 6.9 by IMDB Is that it is a female led movie and critics are forced to, er, like it.And IMDB's rating is based on metacritic.. otherwise it is an ersatz boring unneeded franchise flick for marvel pre-teens... black widow wearing white and involved in a family drama with her sis.Boring."
396,1,"Justifying heroes that murder children is not Okay!! As much as society standard and tolerance for gore, violence etc. Has grown.. Justifying murder of kid/s and especially by a role model ""Hero"" is never going to be okay in my book no matter how much they like to sugar coat it, it just makes for a sick society."
397,7,"Once you go black, you become a widow Despite the disappointment I experienced by not seeing Olivier Richters (the Dutch Giant) as much as I'd have liked, I get it, his acting wasn't especially great. However, the film:It starts of with me wishing the actors shut up, and I cringed and was wondering why I wasn't doing something else. But, it becomes quite nice after the first 10 minutes (and these 10 minutes are kind of crucial for the rest of the film).The story is okay, simple but exciting. Weighty yet lighthearted, humerous and not overly superhero centered (as in that 20 superheroes are fighting for 50% of a film and having debates and useless conversation for the rest, which I hate (and which makes me dislike a lot of marvel movies; especially 'the avengers')).As for the black widow as a character, this film helps build that for sure, and gives her new dimensions with respect to background and more.The Yelena girl is freaking hot, which makes this film a 7 and not a 6.Also, special effects were cool, but that s something marvel always nails."
398,8,"Fun flick I'm a Marvel movie fan but have never read a comic so I take the movies for what they are. I thought I was getting more of an origin story but this is not that. I actually need to go back and see how this fits the established MCU timeline. Even though it wasn't the story I was expecting, it was still a fun movie to watch.I thought the first third had great pace, it slowed a little in the middle and then had a good finish. There were very good action sequences, and some decent humor.I didn't quite understand the motivation of the Melina character, but that's ok. Make your popcorn and check it out."
399,3,Absolutely garbage This is such a mess . Scarlet Johansen went to court over profits from movie. I'm amazed she'd want to be accociated with this mess any more than she'd need to be .
400,3,"Borefest Outside of the action sequences which were just ok. , the dialogue and storyline were boring. The comic / entertainment aspect between sisters and parents was flat and didn't work . Its one thing to try to be good and fail and another to be just terrible which is what this movie is ."
401,3,"Train wreck borefest After being delayed for what seemed like years and lawsuits over actor pay I finally decided to watch this. Did not expect much and I'm glad because this movie is not good. Sure it has some moments but overall it's kinda boring as the story is not really interesting.The visuals also look pretty bad for a mcu entry. Maybe if it was a tv show or made exclusively for Disney plus it could get away with the visuals, but this was in theaters. I would be pissed if I paid to see it.It's pretty forgettable as well. It can also be used for evidence in the argument that there is way too many super hero movies currently in Hollywood.Has mcu peaked and now flooding the market with over saturated recycled super hero garbage? At this point I think spider man is our only real last hope to prove that wrong."
402,5,"Black Widow: All the Days of Our Lives The title says it all. This movie is 75% soap opera and about 25% action flick.We were all sorry to see the demise of Black Widow in Avengers: Endgame. So obviously, this movie is a prequel but it is also part origin story.I really wanted to like this movie and I give superhero movies a lot of leeway. To prove that; I actually liked Daredevil and Green Lantern - 2 movies panned by critics and fans alike. But I'd rank this movie way below those two; it just didn't do it for me.The focus was mostly on Natasha's family (not just the Avenger's family) and involved a lot of drama.Lastly, 2 more complaints: no matter how badly beaten up Ms. Romanoff was in a fight, fall or building collapse, she never exhibited more than a slightly bloody nose. And finally - I'm sorry, but you just can't bring in the Elaine Benes character (end of movie) and expect us to take that actress seriously!Final Verdict: Sappy with some James Bond like action scenes."
403,9,"Better than I thought it was going to be. I didn't get to see the movie until it was ""free"" on Disney+, so I had a mixed bag of reviews and plot synopsis videos going into it. I have to say, I enjoyed it very much, and was pleasantly surprised at how much better it was than even the fanbase reviewers said it was going to be.I think they were just doing damage control for Disney, and I'm glad ScarJo got every penny they owed her (or as close as she could come without a couple of decades of litigation) because she was awesome in this movie. **Spoiler** I look forward to little sister being a part of the MCU, and possibly mom and pops on occasion, too. *Spoiler**"
404,6,"Finally! A Movie Were Hot Chicks Are Taken Seriously! The Political Correctness overflows on this one but at least its self-deprecating when the sister keeps making fun of Black Widow's landings and hair flips. The ""woman hurts herself BUT WITH PURPOSE"" is a little heavy handed. Same goes with the ""I had my uterus ripped out against my will"" theme. Somehow there are millions maybe BILLIONS of Black Widows around the world emanating from the ""Red Room."" With updates! But somehow few know the existence of another.Two extra stars given because of the Red Guardian character even though he's two dimensional."
405,6,"Minor MCU. 'Black Widow (2021)' is one of the weaker entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's actually rather forgettable, to be honest. Set after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War (2016)', the film follows its eponymous hero as she teams up with her long-lost sister to take down the people in charge of the 'red room', the brain-washing facility that Natasha herself was forced into as a child. The picture starts out feeling quite different to the other entries in its franchise, with a somewhat dark tone and a 'Bourne'-esque vibe. Eventually, though, it deteriorates into the same formulaic sort of thing we've seen countless times from Marvel Studios, with big CGI set-pieces and forced-in humour. The comedy often clashes with the flick's tone and is, frankly, sometimes quite annoying, whereas the action is far too infrequent and intangible to be fully satisfying. Ray Winston's villain is also the most bland and uninteresting of any baddie in the MCU and, yes, that even includes Malekith the dark elf from 'Thor: The Dark World (2011)'. The film isn't bad, don't get me wrong. There are a few entertaining action scenes, the performances are all on point and the story is generally engaging. It just feels like a pretty passive experience, though. It isn't massively compelling and quite a few of its plot points fall totally flat. Still, it's enjoyable enough to be worth a watch once. However, I can't see myself revisiting it any time soon and, because of where it falls in the MCU's chronology, I don't think I really need to. 6/10."
406,7,"Enjoyable but average.... Finally we get to learn more about Black Widows past. It's a typical Marvel movie, with lots of dramatic action sequences, a lot of CGI, explosions, and all that jazz.The new cast members are fantastic, especially Florence Pugh as Yelena, Natasha's sister. That dynamic, is by far the most enjoyable and best part of this movie... it's a shame they didn't spend more time focusing on the family dynamic because that part of the story was rich and entertaining.The rest of the plot was a little lightweight, and just an excuse for lots of action. So despite an excellent opening, the film begins to lag once you get towards the end...which was a bit predictable.Don't get me wrong it's a hugely enjoyable and easy watching film, but there have been better from the MCU."
407,7,"Good not great I liked it. I was hoping for/expecting a spy movie with lots of secrecy, sneaking, and growth for Natasha. I got a bit of growth and a 'family movie'. I liked her family actually. It wasn't too forced. The intro was awesome with the rendition of smells like teen spirit. She did take a beating like captain America which made her seem super soldiery, that and the falling fighting scene at the climax. Villains weren't great but the story was still entertaining."
408,1,"Editing, cinematography, Direction, script, special FX, acting...a masterclass in how to make a 200 million dollar movie look like an episode of the good doctor Scarlett Johansson looked so bloody bored throughout. The most animated she looked was when she was hitting her head against a table. Which is what I was doing after paying to watch this. Martin Scorsese famously said Marvel movies were like theme park rides. If this was a ride it would be that one where Fabio had a bird fly into his face. Like a bird in the face avoid if you can. This film is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!! P.s who's that Craig David looking butler she has? His acting was hilarious."
409,6,"I expect more now The plot is ok. A little slow at first. This type of movies however impress with graphics and audio. The picture quality is good and the action scenes are decent, but the audio is still a big miss. Central channel again gets the most audio when clearly much more could be played thru surround and Atmos. Sadly, Atmos is little represented. The directors should think how an action scene would sound from different angles in the real world. They can intentionally change the angle of view to incorporate off-center sound points. This will be more interactive. The viewer will feel more involved. When a movie has that many scenes with surround and overhead sound, it's truly a waste of opportunity not to be mastered the right way."
410,4,"You would think Black Widow would be about Black Widow The movie was fine except it tried too hard for the ""we are women here us roar"". If you are going to do a solo movie about a character you really should have it focus on the beginnings of the character. Natasha's sister was more interesting than Black Widow. Her sister even got to do a running joke at Black Widow's poser battle stance. That was funny.But then they did things like Wolverine and introduced a powerful character and dumbed it down to something easy to beat. Taskmaster had a superpower that allowed them to mimic anyone's fighting style (except Deadpool but that's because Deadpool is crazy). Taskmaster was also a male. They boiled Taskmaster down to someone who can be beat with an EMP blast.Natasha blew up a little girl in her past and they used that little girl to brainwash and put a chip in her brain that allowed her to mimic all fighting styles. They took a powerful superpower and made it wimpy and easy to beat. They also took the character who made their own ideological choices and made it into a female remote controlled cyborg.When it was discovered Natasha blew up a little girl just to make sure she got her target (she didn't) not one person even spent one second on how horrible that was. It was mentioned and moved on.Another issue was dad pretty much tried the whole time to re-integrate the family and apologized for his part. He did not know the whole plan and yet they kept giving him the cold shoulder. Mom knew everything and yet they were letting her off far easier.For a solo movie that was supposed to be an origin story it did nothing of the sort. It picked up after Civil War and was before the next Marvel Universe movie."
411,2,"Lazy and boring writing. Wow, what a dud. The writing is horrible. I could care less about any of these characters."
412,4,Boring Boring movie. Not even worth watching.P. S. There are buffoons in yt comments who have a problem with Taskmaster revealed to be female. Like that even makes a difference.
413,2,"Yawn More of the save the world ,things blowing up, confusing plot, overblown CGI, lousy acting, no originality, super hero Gahr-bahge."
414,5,"Extremely forgettable addition to the MCU Had to finish this over two nights, as this film couldn't hold my attention. No tie-ins to other films or characters in the MCU, and sorry Scarlet, but you're character is just not interesting or deep enough to carry an entire film. The only silver lining is, thank goodness I didn't pay $35 to watch this as a new release."
415,4,Pew What a badly edited snorefest...despite great action sequences...incongrous?... I'd have thought so until I saw this. I'm glad the titular character sued disney...she'll need all the cash she can save after this...everybody else outshined her acting wise. Maybe a career as a sleep therapist....
416,7,"A bit of a marvel film for grown ups I thought this was pretty good, i enjoyed Natasha's back story, as well as the action which wasn't overblown, it felt that the characters gelled well and you cared about them. At times it felt like a bit of a bond movie, but that's no bad thing."
417,7,"Not as good, not as great, but was ok. Had good expectations regarding this movie. Though Scarlett Johanson's performance was ok, it was Black Widow's sister who stole the show here. However, story a bit confusing until you built the puzzle and got sense in mid-movie. But takes some time to make sense.It covers 3 periods: 1990s when they were a family (almost, however, you know Disney and family values eh ?), after Civil War after General Russ (always good to see William Hurt) goes after Natasha, and after the end credits (with a little manoeuvre to avoid the constant ""shrinking credits"" function from Disney+...) when Valentina summons Yelena for a ""special mission"" after the ""Avengers Endgame"" events.Ok to watch one time, but move on to further with the Fourth phase, including the Disney+ Marvel exclusive series..."
418,5,"As average as it gets I feel kinda sorry for Scarlet Johansson who get ""her own movie"" after the entire MCU was pretty much done with everything relevant to her character. It shows."
419,6,It's an decent movie If you love superhero movies and don't care about the flaws in this movie your gonna love it but if you see it thoroughly you'll see all the mistakes it has.
420,5,"This film is the epitome of... ...Average filmmaking.Here are few words which can describe this film: Unnecessary Uninteresting DisappointingRe-watch another marvel film to shake off the dullness after you are done with black widow.I m not saying don't watch it; but once you do, you will know!By the way my reviews for black widow here keep getting deleted.So here's another one..."
421,1,"Some of the leading indoctrinations in this movie! 1-At the end of the movie, the bad guy was explaining about his plans and says that he rescues small girls that are left by their families worldwide and he give them a new life by making them his soldiers... And the hero that try to kill him, didn't respond like 'WHAT THE F...!' She should have give a reaction like that, because in reality, child kidnapping and child trafficking is the REAL issue, and if the bad guy would say, 'We kidnap girls to make them our soldiers' that would be much much more true... BUT no, he can not say that, because this kind movies are made to indoctrinate some agenda to you and by that seen in this movie, they are implementing the idea that 'Humans are bad. Bad humans, they leave their kids and there are so many kids left in the streets' But in Truth, child kidnapping is a worldwide organized issue.By the way, IF you want to watch a much much more realistic FEMALE SPY action movie, watch Luc Besson's NIKITA movie...2. In the movie, they can control people or pigs via computer, but if you know that this can not be done, and Elon Musk's -experiment advertises- are fake, then you know this is another brain washing... They are trying to implement the idea to you that, human beings are a piece of meat, and we don't have a soul and wecan be hacked and controlled... Even with a fragrance that is put on a man!!! Oh my, that was so unrealistically stupid...3- There are quite a number women characters in this movie and non of them are able to give birth. If you are aware that the main character is a transgender, then you know that this movie is NOT a feminist propaganda (as many reviewers quote), but is a transgender propaganda. As we well know that, you can make a man look exactly like a woman, by hormone supply, by surgery, plus make up and etc... but you can not give him a UTERUS! And therefore, he-she can not give birth. And by putting characters in a movie as leading-hero roles, how can there be a better brain washing than that?4- If you know that Cold war was actually not real, USA and Soviet Union were two neighbor countries that never made a real war between each other (there is only a Bosporus between them) and cold war was a excuse for the USA and Soviet's to invade and shape other countries, then you again know that this movie's script is junk... Listen to former KGB agent Yuri Bezmenov's videos in internet, or read former US agent William Cooper's book, then you know that US and Soviet was actually working together, secretly of course!"
422,3,"One of marvels worst. I had high expectations for this film as it being Marvels 2nd female lead film. However within the first 40 minutes I found myself bored out of my mind, the story is extremely bland in my opinion with the exception of the taskmaster character being a throwback to older fans.The film repeats them being a broken family over and over with the viewers losing interest in the film. One positive thing I have to say is the start of the film had a lot of action which enticed me to watch more. I personally find the Black Widow character like a cardboard box, very bland along with the other characters. Not much personality is put into the characters which is a shame as there is a lot of potential. The fight scenes are solid except for parts in the 3rd acts where CGI is very noticeable which is a shame for Marvel.In comparison films like Shang Chi and Spider Man far from home blows Black Widow out of the water. So in conclusion a poor film on Marvels behalf and definitely a film fans won't remember for a while."
423,5,Meh Not bad not great. Same stuff as before and it doesn't add anything other than the end of credits scene.
424,2,Don't waste your time I watched this movie on Disney plus and I am glad I didn't had to pay ticket. This movie is not very good with lots of plot holes. Acting was ok. Some of the actions scenes were good. Overall it was hard to be excited about a character that you know dies.
425,6,"Boring... It feels like it was made during the pandemic. You see the same 3 - 4 actors in the entire movie and it's mostly slow dialogue. It felt like this film had a really low budget and couldn't afford a good script, special effects, or a dialogue coach to help them with a descent Russian accent. One of the actors sounded like Scotty from Star Trek. The ending also looked like recycled footage of the helicarrier getting blown up. Disney is lucky this movie made any $$$ in the movie theatre. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. Dust-ver-dantia. (Goodbye in terrible Russian accent)"
426,3,A waste of time There wasnt anything about this movie that was good. They had so much time to do this and this is all that was put out? A total waste of time.
427,1,"too much Estrogen Utter garbage, too much CGI, store line lame. Could they of cast any more women in a film!!. Not a scratch or hair out of place. Over compensation is just as bad as under representation. Seriously the worst movie I have watch in years."
428,3,Sorry for Marvel This is a very poor storyline and badly directed. Disappointment all around. No wonder Disney released early.
429,5,"Just okay Maybe slightly below average for an Avenger movie, but still pretty good thanks to Florence Pugh's character."
430,8,"Nice Black Widow Back Story This was nice to see the character's background. It had a really good cast. For a longer movie, it went really fast. Good movie."
431,1,"XMen 2/Wolverine origin rip-off This is one of the worst movies i can remember seeing. I think the MCU puts out great movies and i always thought black widow was cool but this movie was just trash. So forced, so lame, so boring and so predictable.Plot: the guy you thought you killed isnt dead. Lets go kill himPrison break scene was utter trash. ""Banter"" was boring. I hate this movie."
432,5,Average Feel bad for Scarlett and her sister in this. Why oh why don't American movies get real foreigners to play the foreigners. Ray Winston is utterly awful as a Russian.
433,6,"Not perfect but good fun in the end It's an odd film. Starts off a bit slowly but soon gets going. There's some good action and fight sequences. But it does fall down in places and the plot is a bit weak. Ray Winston was badly miscast, with a strange cockney/new York cabbie/faux Russian accent. It all starts off quite serious but there are a few much-needed laughs. And the main saving grace was Florence Pugh, who complety stole the show. We enjoyed it in the end, just don't take it too seriously!"
434,3,Mmm... naa Massive fan of the marvel universe but not this one. I recommend you put your head in a bucket of lego and shake it about. It will have a stronger story plot and the images will be the same.
435,8,So everyone is a critic now It may not be the best but I've seen worse.. much worse.I enjoyed watching it. Florence Pugh was amazing in it. Opening was a great set up. Just watch and decide for yourself.
436,10,Hello I have never seen it . Why i missed why? It's a great movie for me but you maybe like it if you be one in black widow fans. Funny part is so smooth. It suppose to be no.1 movie forever in MCU.
437,10,Hi there 10/10 no.1 it is a great movie 🍿 good action Marvel's style. I can't stop watch it. It also has funny part. Because I like black widow so i review this is amazing ;)
438,5,"Having a tough time following the intro... I'm only into this about 10 minutes and the intro was convoluted and frankly non sensical...I'll come back to this review if I actually get through the whole thing...**Update** Yes I finished watching, but it was a major struggle not to click my remote, heh heh...thre is no coherent story anywhere, just a bunch of women and one nutjob Russion maybe super hero running around to many different places all over the world...nooo, I did not like it at all, so I am dropping my rating to a 3, thank you...the people at Marvel should be hanging their heads in shame on this one..."
439,5,"Hugely disappointing Great actors, great director. But it just seemed like they didn't work. One thing I love about black widow in other films has been the wide camera fight scenes where you can see Scarlett has trained hard and learnt the moves, and they look epic. It appears the director forgot Scarlett is insanely talented and went for the cheap cut scenes in every single fight sequence. Honestly it just really felt the whole way through that the director knew nothing about modern action movies and was trying to make Gone With The Black Widow and Prejudice... Black Widow deserved more."
440,6,"Generic Black Widow is a slightly boring, generic superhero film, which, however, makes the good move of introducing Natasha Romanoff's little sister, Yelena. A small part of the childhood story is exciting enough, but most of the family part is not the most interesting. The CGI does not work at times and Dreykov is not exciting at all. Scarlett is doing well, though, especially in the confrontation with Dreykov. She can play the keys whenever she has the opportunity."
441,1,Boring movie Predictable plot and story line. No substance no real character building in movie just another boring movie that falls in the repeatism of movies like mission impossible which are another series that are impossible to sit through without losing interest in the film.
442,5,"Black Widow deserved better Good actors and great cinematography, but silly plot and villain. I've always loved Black Widow in the Avengers movies, but she deserved a better story in her own movie. This one was a bit messy and boring. Great CGI and effects though, but I've seen this kind of action so many times before. A very good, but sad after credit scene!"
443,6,Erm She could have just pinched her nose. And how did that thing fly? And why did she never mention her family or the whole widow world domination to anyone??Ok movie but just too silly.
444,5,"Better than expected but still middle of the road I honestly didn't expect much from this film and it was much better than I thought it was going to be. But make no mistake, it's still middle of the road and a weak story.Florence Pugh outshone everyone in my opinion and I have to agree the accents were terrible. When will people realise outside of a hard-man cockney role, Ray Winstone can't act to save his life? - and I'm British.I was surprised Taskmaster wasn't in it as much as I assumed. That character felt a bit wasted and I can completely understand why people label this as a filler film. It's like they had a token tough villain and purposefully only wanted to scratch the surface and not go deeper into the character.Shame."
445,5,"Disappointing I don't think this was the vehicle that Natasha or Scarlett wanted or needed. I was interested at the beginning but the story just waned and I felt that I really didn't know any more about Black Widow's powers or what motivates her.The best thing about this movie is Florence Pugh as Natasha's sister. She's feisty and just lights up the screen. I liked her in Little Women, which was obviously a very different role. I think this actress will go on to bigger and better things.If I was Scarlett Johansson, I'd be feeling quite let down. Disappointing."
446,6,"Competent but also kind of disappointing Some good action, some good humour, plus some not so great action and more than a few jokes that fell flat.Ray Winstone was meant to be a stand-in for Harvey Weinstein, right?Funny how the protagonist and antagonist are played by actors who have both been main characters in Jonathan Glazer films."
447,10,Fantastic This was awesome the family dynamic was interesting I still hope Natasha is still alive somewhere.
448,2,"Cate, Hands Up & Step Away From the MCU This film needs to get at least twice as good to be horrible. Thor, The Dark World thanks you.All that acting talent, a decent storyline and a big pile of fibre filled bowel expulsion ends up being the sum."
449,3,"Couldnt make it through Thor 2 was bad, iron man 3 was worse, black panther was a garage fire, but black widow might take the cake as the most bloated, incoherent disney movie of them all. 2 hours of dumb film. Bored to death and had to throw in the white towel after 45 minutes."
450,8,I liked it I liked it. Not sure what all the hate is about. Thought it was a good movie.
451,10,Best Avenger Movie!!!! Nat and Yelena are the best in the movie...Highly recommend...Must watch.
452,6,Falls flat I had wondered if this character could carry a movie by herself. Don't get me wrong I like her character but she is much better when paired with Hawkeye and the other Avengers. While it had its moments this movie is a bad version of the Bourne Trilogy (with all women as the agents). It didn't add anything to the MCU and I agree with another poster that it was basically a filler episode. The bonus scene was one of the better parts. Glad I waited to watch it on regular Disney Plus.
453,2,"Of course they would do that to the Taskmaster character How do you take a silver age villain, remove all interesting aspects, history, and shove him off into the sunset in 90 minutes? Make it the opposite of what he is suppose to be."
454,6,Acting and story were good. Direction and lighting were awful The acting was brilliant. The story was great. But why did they pick an unknown director that made all actors/actresses look awful. The lighting looked like it was on a low rate TV budget. With a huge Disney budget is this the best they could come up with? I really wanted to rate this film higher. But what a waste.
455,4,Watchable but pretty boring The story was quite interesting in the first half buf fell overly extended in the end. The villian was one of the most boring villians I have ever seen and the sidekicks were pretty generic in my opinion. The movie was ok but I dont think that I would ever feel a need to rewatch this..
456,4,"Typical big budget action I fell asleep during the middle, but I didn't care for the parts I saw. I was curious to see what they would do with Florence Pugh, but I didn't like the character at all. I hope they will find a way to make her more interesting in the Hawkeye series. I was not into the story or the action, and I ended liking this one only slightly more than my least favorite Marvel film: Captain Marvel. Much too formulaic."
457,9,"A great blend of Action and Humour What a film, loved every second of it. Action throughout and brilliant bits of comedy thrown in. Can't see why there are so many negative reviews as the only bad thing about this film was Ray Winstones Russian accent. Other than that it was almost perfect and up there with one of the best Avenger films."
458,3,Terrible Stupid fake Russian accents. Shallow unlikeable characters. Bad writing. Plot is boring.How come. When Disney can make the brilliant Cruella and The Mandalorian. Why are the Marvel movies so brain dead?
459,4,"Surprisingly bad To keep it concise - superficial villains, underwhelming story, unusually noticable VFX hiccups.Good acting by the main cast and partially impressive fight choreos cannot save this loveless spinoff. Particularly towards the end the movie disintegrates in scenes which actually made my friend and I facepalm."
460,3,"Awful, just another computer game Marvel's dead... just one long fight, chase battle scene..... Very little story, even less character development."
461,3,"Outside of X-MEN This is by far the most boring, non entertaining marvel film (not counting the last two X-Men films) I have seen since 2008.This film is low on the redemption factor."
462,6,"Well Executed Avenger Back Story The fight scenes, the aerocopter things crashing into the airborne super HQ. Well done but you've seen it all before. Literally. Anyway great Black Widow back story and the non action stuff very good and original. However we need to talk about Ray. Winstone that is. Everyone else does a convincing job with their Russian accents, but his efforts are just so lazy and his casting just really sticks out against so many strong performances."
463,1,"What did I just watch Boring pointless story line.Love that apparently the fake mum had time to switch clothing with black widow undo her braids and put a wig on that matched the black widows hair exactly / same style. Crazy that.And black widows falling through the air to catch her sister LOL.Pheromone lock HAHA in WHAT!?Black widow sure is strong I mean she survived 2 car crashes, a plane crash, a fight with taskmaster, a few punches from the fat old Russian and then a fall from the sky. All she suffered was a little nose bleed."
464,2,"How did ANYONE reasonable green light this? This plot is so Messily constructed I don't know who, in their right mind, said ""this is passable."" There are so many basic plot holes, poor connection between characters, and various other things that limit this movie's potential it's frighteningly abominable.1. How did Natasha even find Yelena?2. After Yelena realized Natasha wasn't sent to kill her, why didn't she have some marginal glee to seeing her? If she hated her so much, why did she stick around?3. How did Natasha even get the antiserum? Who even developed it? Why, what happened to this person?4. How'd they find Alexei? Why was he in prison, and why is he portrayed as so idiotic?5. Why did Melania help them? She showed no interest in them at all, yet suddenly she's helping them?6.where the hell was the Red Room? Norway? Hungary? Russia?7. Why did they take Taskmaster, a character from spider man, put them into this, made it a Russian woman who is the daughter of the fiendish general?8. THE PHEROMONE LOCK? REALLY?Honestly I could go on, but that's just the short list. None of the characters had chemistry, they were all disinterested in each other and there was nothing believable about them even caring about themselves. This is seriously poor writing, and after the giants of Infinity and Endgame, and the surprising greatness ofLoki, Wandavision and the Winter Soldier, this is such a sad instalment it might as well be next to Ed Norton's Hulk. This movie felt like 5 people wrote it and instead of compromising and making something cohesive, they smashed it together and went ""yeah, whatever."""
465,3,"Summarizing the way Russians are portrayed in this movie gave me a 24 hour ban on Facebook for hate speech The people and events portrayed in this movie are... incredible.Marvel films generally require you to believe in an alternate reality in which aliens and advanced technology exist. Once you believe in that reality (for the duration of the movie), people and events portrayed in the movie make sense. Not so with this movie. You will know early on, when a regular human being survives a fall from a 10-story building without a scratch, hitting at least three balconies with their back on the way down. Because I don't want to spoil anything (else), I'm limiting myself to this example, but the list of unbelievably unbelievable events is very long.Also, we're back at the tone of the original Cap film, in which a small team of Americans can successfully invade a ultra high security Nazi facility because apparently Nazis can't aim a gun. In Black Widow, Russians are given the American Superiority Complex treatment. They occasionally speak ""Russian"", but a Russian friend couldn't understand what they said when they did. Fortunately, they use ""Ienglisj wiz verri stronk"" aksent for the rest of the movie, unless an actor temporarily forgets and sounds American for half a sentence, which happens regularly. They're all megalomaniacs and pretty much all losers. I commented on a Facebook thread how Black Widow depicts Russians. That was flagged as Hate Speech. I find that absolutely hilarious.Bonus points for being able to look at Florence for a long time. And for staying away from requiring the female actors to appear in underwear at least once."
466,1,Wast of time and talent. I am so glad I did not pay to watch this when it was first available through Disney. I can't believe this movie was as bad as it was. A true waste of 2 hours and 14 minutes of my life!👎
467,8,"Nice change for a change Really enjoyed the story and the focus on women. I believe everyone will like this movie.Peace, Brian Bruce."
468,1,Disney does it again Thank you Disney for ruining yet another franchise. This was less about Marvel and solely about the bad feelings that make them feel icky inside. I half expected the final battle to be a protest where they cry on CNN about the mistreatment of women by a fat old white guy.What a disgrace to the actors and the creators of this franchise.
469,8,"Glad they made this movie I'm glad they made this movie.Pros: Great casting, especially Florence Pugh. Top notch action. Cool bad guy.Cons: Kinda under developed in parts. Some parts of the movie just come off a little cheap."
470,10,"Pleasantly surprised with how well this turned out After hearing this movie was only okay I was very happy to experience otherwise. Scarlet Johanson was amazing in this movie. The action sequences were astounding, especially the sky falling fight. It was not an over the top super hero movie, it felt a bit more down to earth. Oh and a lot of hot chicks that can really kick ass."
471,4,Drab. Could have been great Florence Pugh was the highlight of this drab movie... the concept was there but the execution was poor. If Disney went for an 18 rating and good script it could have been amazing.
472,5,"Wow I LOVE the change in, Teen Spirit, really dope. I also love the GOT reference in battle, EPIC. I waited a long time to watch this, no spoilers.....just enjoy. I liked this WAY BETTER than Wonder Woman......I prefer THE OLD WW films."
473,8,"It redeems itself Black Widow starts off well with a prolog that sets up the backstory and motivations of the characters. But unfortunately then gets bogged down by numerous chase and fight sequences. And while I get they're necessary in a Marvel movie, they feel a bit gratuitous and it's the kind of maneuvering we've seen now many many many times already. It's kind of boring sadly.But as the movie crests - mid second act, we really get to dive into what's at the heart of everyone and it connects. This gives some great traction for a very inventive ending. It redeems itself quite well and brought a smile to my face because I was genuinely hoping to like this movie. And I do.Thumbs up!"
474,6,"A perfectly serviceable Marvel movie Black Widow is one of the few characters in the MCU that I don't find interesting. To me, she's just a cudgel for Nick Fury to use for various espionage missions. I also feel like this movie is five years too late. So I went into this movie with low expectations, and to my surprise, this film turned out to be decent. It won't be in the upper echelon of the Marvel movies for me, but for what it is, it's serviceable. I enjoyed the interplay between Yelena and Natasha, for me, they were one of the many highlights of the film.And I also enjoyed Yelena's rant about Natasha always posing, I thought that was amusing. Other characters, like Melina and Alexel, feel like a real couple, even though their relationship was a front for the Russian government. The film also does a commendable job of fleshing out Natasha's back story with Dreykov and his daughter Antonia, things that were only alluded to in The Avengers. Speaking of Dreykov's daughter, I guess that Taskmasker was Drekykov's daughter from the get-go, not because I'm super smart or anything, it just thematically fits with the theme of the film, which is the sins of the past will come back to haunt you. Alas, there are things that did not work for me. The action scenes felt obligatory and perfunctory to me; there was not a single action scene that stood out to me.Even the culminating action sequence in the third act with the crashing air fortress, while visually impressive feels hollow to me. I get the sense that the family drama between the four characters was what the director Cate Shortland wanted, and the obligatory action sequences were what Marvel Studios wanted. But I guess that's the nature of corporate Hollywood. Filmmaking after all is the art of compromise. And I also chalk this up to me seeing a lot of MCU movies, and they do tend to get a little formulaic at times. On a more positive note, I did enjoy the sequence of Natasha liberating the female spies from Dreykov's grip in the climax. That was a very powerful moment for me.And speaking of Dreykov, he's a nasty piece of work, using his daughter and various other women as disposable pawns for his own ends. This might be a reach, but this character feels like a stand-in for Harvey Weinstein. Which is fine by me, I think Weinstein is scum. Plus, thematically having an evil male character makes for a great foil for the female heroes. Honestly, I thought that Dreykov's inclusion in the film felt very organic to the story, so it wasn't too preachy or didactic for me. In conclusion, if you're a diehard MCU fan or just a casual fan, you might get some enjoyment out of Black Widow. Oh, I also enjoyed Malia J's cover to Nirvanna's ""It Smells Like Teen Spirit"" in the opening credit sequence, I thought that was a nice touch. Nuff said."
475,10,"Rogue Avenger *If there are people who have not seen Captain America: Civil War or Avengers: Infinity War, please do not read this review* Set after the fight between Captain America and allies vs. Tony Stark and allies, an Avenger goes rogue (off on her own), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow goes into exile. Okay, so let me back way before the Civil War. Super Solders started way back when Steve Rogers first became the first super soldier for the Americans, little did the United States Government know, Russia was building their own Super Soldier - Alexei Shostakov aka The Red Guardian (a counterpart to Captain America). During this time, what Natasha's parents did not know, they were the parents of an Avenger. She was trained to kill, but she chose to train to help.Okay, now let us rewind to Civil War, Natasha goes into exile and comes back to Russia to find her sister and help dismantle a secret organization known as the Red Room - a place that creates girls into being assassins (or better known as black widows). It is during this time of renewal, that Natasha figures out that she had to choose a side - go back to the life of an Avenger or stay by her family - she chose the earlier. She went back to help in the fight to destroy Thanos, but that is for a review that was previously written.As any Marvel fan would know, there are loopholes and holes in all the MCU films that spill into each one of them, Black Widow is no exception to the rule. But I do have to say that this movie met the expectations of a true Marvel fan. Continuing, when Natasha died in Avengers: Infinity War to find the soul stone on Vorimir, that left everyone in shock, but she fulfilled her duty as an Avenger and fighter.Scarlett Johansson, how to describe this woman - she did an amazing job portraying the character so wonderfully and beautifully done.I loved this movie. I would say that Black Widow will always be in every heart of every boy and girl and in the hearts of a true MCU fan."
476,5,"Totally irrelevant movie fails to impress An unnecessary movie about a now- irrelevant character who has been dead for years, Black Widow tells the story of what happened to Natasha after the events of Civil War. Why this movie wasn't released after Civil War itself, and why they waited until five years later (two years after Black Widow died too!) is a good reason why most people probably don't care about this movie anymore.If it was actually good, this may have turned the tide a bit, but the story is bland, the motivations of the bad guy are never explained at all, Taskmaster is underwhelming (although long time fans might enjoy the various fighting styles) and even more so after the ridiculous reveal of who he/she is, and the entire story is just the MCU's attempt at ""Taken.""There is little to no humour in the movie, and it takes itself way too seriously until. Red Guardian is back. But even his awkwardness isn't enough to bring a desperately needed lighter tone.It's not all bad, as the actors do a decent job and the fight scenes are good, but as I said before: it's just all bland and mediocre, and in the end, we get no meaningful closure to Black Widow's death, or anything else for that matter.I missed this one in theatres, and I'm happy I waited until it became free to watch on Disney+. No way I would have been happy after paying so much for this."
477,8,"Enjoyed thoroughly BW is not one of my favourites from Marvel, however I was surprised.l, would say that Florence Pugh and David Harbour have the standout parts and carry the film better than the main character. With that said it's a thumbs up."
478,10,"Amazing Loved this movie good action, storyline. Only wish it would have came after Civil War."
479,2,"More garbage from marvel. Terrible writing, predictable and bad direction. Total waste of time."
480,1,"So bad. Maybe worst of the Marvel-universe movies.I did need to stop watching at the 1:42.Really, this movie is not worth of watching. Or look once, and forget."
481,6,Decent flick This certainly isn't the MCU's best outing but it's not as bad as people are saying. 1 and 2 stars? Who's the geniuses sitting through a movie they consider a 1 star? Not so smart if you ask me. If this took place in Wakanda it'd win awards just like the average Black Panther movie .
482,2,"Strange failure I really shouldn't write a review for a movie I fast-forwarded through as much as I did this one. But something this strange warrants noting.First, the pacing. The pacing of the earlier films was mostly impeccable. Fight scenes didn't last too long and were broken up by cool CGI and character turns. Here? Endless chase/fight sequences, glazed-eyed-boring to everyone other than 11 year old boys who are truly jazzed up by cars flipping through the air. Bang, pow, screech, crash, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, my god it's 30 minutes now .... After a while I muted it and started skimming the news on my phone. Missed nothing. Why abandon a famously winning formula for a juvenile hackneyed one? Strange.Second, characters. The Black Widow was fascinating in the earlier films for her combination of uncanny fighting skill and a complex personality that's almost completely missing here. After waiting for this film with great anticipation, I found myself not caring about her at all. I don't recall the last time I so completely lost interest in a character; I never want to see her again. Wiping out interest in an Avenger ... have to credit the director and writers with that strange achievement.Finally, and worst, there's no fun here! The Marvel movies have been marvelous fun in combining real suspense with wit, originality with splashes of satire, danger with warmth. You laughed moments before you held your breath. Here I did neither. If that bit about a chopped up uterus was supposed to be comic relief, jeez, no. If dad congratulating his daughters on all their murders was supposed to be funny, jeez, no. Black Widow is more like a gritty cold war film from the 1960s: brooding, dark, depressed, gruesome, grim. Maybe it's partly the unrelentingly gloomy score.What a strange turn... take a great party and pour dirty ice water over the whole thing."
483,5,"Ugh! A definite letdown Really bad editing! Shockingly bad as a matter of fact. Love Marvel and MCU movies, but this one is a definite flop. Poor suspense building. Great music but poorly timed. Seemed very all over the place."
484,10,Well written I was hooked from the minute it started. Excellent writing with a fascinating story populated with good characters with intelligence. This is what I ask for in a movie.
485,7,"Disappointingly Routine Something about this movie just seemed so bland. It's an afterthought in the Marvel saga, and when I say that I'm not disparaging the character, I'm simply stating a fact. This film takes place just before Avengers: Infinity War and so we already know how her story ultimately ends which drains some tension from the story presented here. Sure, it's fun seeing her interact with the other members of the Romanoff family. I especially liked Florence Pugh (who doesn't apparently), she's going to make a great Black Widow going forward. As an average moviegoer who isn't steeped in Marvel lore, it was also fun getting to know Natasha's backstory. I also think the idea to bring in a Harvey Weinstein-ish villain was more than appropriate. It made the story more relevant to some important social issues. Ultimately, however, the movie suffers from that afterthought-ish nature I mentioned earlier. This feels less important than what we saw in the other Avengers movies. Very by-the-numbers direction that lacked punch. It's such a shame because there are things about this movie that I liked and had they been in a better film would've been a great movie rather than a ho-hum one."
486,2,"No storyline, boring The storyline make no sens. Acting is horrible. A wasted 2 hours."
487,2,"Yes, we are going down. Marvel did a really good and a long ride there. Years and years of material giving people good time. Spending too much time with a new friend Netflix, everything started to loose sense and style."
488,8,"What's with the haters No idea why this has such poor reviews. Its none stop action and acted well. Got to agree with some others that BW sister is a carbon copy of villanelle from killing eve, however she is great in it. Loved it. Ignore the haters!"
489,3,"Less than Marvel Standard. Parts of this Movie are really good and the overall Quality of Video and Sound design is, as always with Marvel, on point.But the Story is the biggest problem and where my disappointment with this film lies, it feels like the writers realized that halfway through their idea was not working out as the first out feels overly detailed, and the second hour feels very rushed with scenes cutting between the different characters and time. It often feels like they added Scenes as an afterthought to explain some action in the movie, what disappoints me the most. Often I got the feeling that the main Characters were constantly jumping between Coldhearted, Over natural fighters and then to light-hearted, maybe even ""fragile"" woman with big hearts. While booth are okay to use in a Story, the mixture just feels forced and bad. I'm sure that Cinema Sins will have a fun time picking on all the plot holes!In total, this move has some nice strong scenes, especially in empowering female Heroes, but its story completely disappoints.I ah sure that the movie would have gotten better reviews if it would not be in the MCU, as this means an obvious comparison to the Other movies in the MCU and in this regard the Movie is disappointing for me as I feel like it neither follows up on the Characters already established nor the general tone of the MCU. This film tries too hard to build its own closed of Story and does not pick up any existing Story of the MCU.I had high hopes for this Movie, and I sadly got disappointed.TL;DR: at best average film, disappointing for MCU standard. 3/10."
490,3,"Bad movie Cheesey to the core; balance was off and clearly trying to pull off a big budget movie without having the actual budget. Fine for a tv movie, but not a blockbuster."
491,3,"Ruining a good character. I thought of Black widow as the perfect spy with a mysterious past and a heart of steel.Now I know, she is a terrible spy, cries a lot and grew up in Ohio.3 stars because Scarlett Johansson is pretty, and I ll quickly forget this movie ever happened."
492,2,A useless character gets its own story = Marvel has run out of stories and characters... they dress the cartwheeling useless character called Black.. in White and...Like the old sitcom trick introduce family members...thenWhy would they make such an incoherent non-story? My 3 year old can make up a better story! 🤣 Please don't waste good popcorn on this movie. Save it for watching good quality paint drying.
493,7,"Not that bad It was better than I expected, and I truly thought it was going to be awful since BW is not the most interesting Avenger. The fighting and action was decent, and the humor was the right amount....made me chuckle a few times.Acting was good, and the storyline wasn't bad at all. I'd watch a sequel, it's worth the watch."
494,8,"Violence Elle anyone? I've just watched this film on Disney+ and had heard this had been slated, not sure why? As there's been other MCU films which was less appealing.I do Florence Pugh stole the show, but also felt that she based her character on Villen Elle, and they even made her look like her aswell, so I kept thinking I was an episode of Killing Eve.Overall a good afternoon film where you check you brain in on."
495,1,"Yaaaaaawn My god a waste of time.. Usually a huge fan of Marvel universe... Seen All movies With My daughter and When she dragged me through the follow up series i was quite sceptical but Even thoose i liked very much.The first hour i fell asleep not once but 3 times and Still at the reuion as i felt the movieplot picked up a Little but then was SO dissapointed in the acting between the family members and general acting.The movie had great potential in a good story but drowns in gimmicks, cgi action (not the good kind) and generally bad acting.It Does Get better but having to wait 1.5 hours before feeling af connection to any1 character is just too long..Dont waste Time on This... 😑 2 hours of My life I Will never Get back."
496,1,I would do anything to get my time back I have watched thousands of movies but this one... this one... this one has to be the worst thing I've ever watched. I sat in the cinema for 2 hours feeling nothing but second hand embarrassment from everyone involved in this MCU filler episode. I would rather be at work on a Monday morning or be listening to my mother in law for an entire weekend than watching this again.
497,4,"So Boring This movie sucked, it was incredibly boring, the accents were terrible, and the storyline was awful."
498,1,"This is why I prefer DC Controversial opinion, I know. Marvels just lost their touch endgame was literally the endgame for marvel, it all went downhill from there but then I was introduced to something not many people like, but is better than the MCU, the DCEU, not only have they released quality movies (except for Suicide Squad 2016 and WW84) but they actually know how to make a good franchise! Goodbye marvel, i wont miss you."
499,10,"It is worth it. I was really looking forward to this campaign called Black Widow because it went to the cinema again. I was very impressed and satisfied with what I saw. I really like Marvel movies so I liked this one too. It's amazing how the studio continues to tell everything.The plot is very interesting and the characters are very good. The music was very well done. Of the actors, Skarlett Johansson was the star as Natasha Romanoff. I also really liked her sister played by Florence Pugh and you can even say she was very cute.Finally, I would like to say that this movie is very good and very entertaining. Check out the movie, you won't regret it."
500,1,"Why? Ray Winston pretending to play a russian is painful to watch. Terrible actor and worse accent, poor casting choice! Suprising for a franchise with such a huge budget. Stick to the gambling adverts!"
501,5,"Marvel fall short on this film This film made me want to just leave the room and go on my computer or Xbox, it's really boring and forgettable, the directing is meant for a drama not a action movie, but I liked the characters and I like how it explores black widows backstory."
502,2,"Marvel has run out of steam You can see they made less effort with this one, it's pretty boring and slow paced too and gets tedius really fast. After about 20 minutes I was looking for something else to do while it played out.Getting really bored of assassin's fighting in the street and everyone still going about their business and no police ever seem to turn up."
503,4,"How the mighty have fallen This can't be a Marvel movie. It was such an underwhelming, meandering, lame bore it can't possibly be of the same franchise as ""Avengers: Endgame"" or ""Iron Man."" Just Scarlett and Florence groaning and moaning about their horrible, lost childhood in a post-Soviet Russian evil organization."
504,9,Brilliant film This film is another great addition to the marvel universe. Has brilliant comedic moments especially from Florence Pugh. The action is great and not too much of it. It's a shame it did not get the cinematic release (pandemic problems) because it really did deserve it. Was great to see a female lead again (Wanda and captain marvel being the others) and no love interests!! Recommend a watch or two.
505,7,"Fitting finale to the tale of Natasha Romanoff Taking place after Captain America: Civil War, this film sees Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) meeting up with her old comrades from Russia in order to bring down Red Room, the secretive black ops program that made her who she is.First of all, we should have had this movie years ago. Preferably right after Civil War and definitely before Infinity War. The fact that we only got it now is... a whole bag of issues.Putting that aside, I liked the film a lot. Johansson is still amazing as Natasha, although I do have to admit that some of the side characters ended up stealing this film from her. Florence Pugh as Yelena, another Black Widow, was a riot and a hoot. I'm definitely hoping that we will see more of her in the MCU. David Harbour as Red Guardian, Captain America's Russian counterpart, was also a great character and I'd like to know more about his past and his fixation on Steve.Aside from that, the movie contained the usual amount of Marvel goodness. Great action scenes, top of the line visual effects, clever quips, one mindblowing end battle. You know, the usual. What we've come to expect from Marvel, in the best possible way.Is it the best Marvel film ever made? No. Should it have been made before Endgame? Yes. Was it still worth the wait? Very much so."
506,6,"The 1st Marvel movie during COVID-19 Johansson may be a bit old for the actions. Storyline is okay, a bit boring. But Marvel movies~~~Finally, what's wrong with the Taskmaster in this ver."
507,10,"Incredible If only more stars were available so I'll max out (a rarity) at the ten. Negative reviews were often either action scenes seen before or a DVD issue. Yes, we've all seen car/cycle chases ad infinitum, and floating cities. But, when if what you represent so far outclasses the past, then that is noteworthy. Car/cycle chase scenes (crashes of course) were realistic & mind blowing. The CGI scenes involving the floating city - best ever. Yes, the usual action fight scenes were typical (not much you can do there) but didn't detract. Storyline of evil corporate mind controlling & mysterious drug to counter said nastiness also done before, but fit in well with the storyline. The search for one's family done before; also well done here. Some tongue-in-cheek humor to lighten the mood at times.Intelligent dialogue, ""This would be a cool way to die."" as they were about to be frozen in an avalanche (great CGI). Many great locations, Norway, Budapest, Morocco, Bahamas."
508,8,Emotion filled Great story Beautifully engaging family dynamic. Jaw dropping impact scenes. Refreshing continuous running gags and a truly fullfilling story arc for a beloved character.This contained well needed character development for Black widow and I was hooked within the first 5 minutes.An amazing watch.
509,3,"Very happy ending!!! This was Marvel's worst creation, There is no longer any power limit for the story line, especially in the female part!We live in a time when Hollywood and the media are over-exploring, and that has reduced quality."
510,8,"I am disconnected from this world I have heard how bad the movie is, but since it is MCU, I wanted to watch this anyway.And hot damn, I really liked it. The characters were likable, Natashas sister was absolutely hilarious, the story was wholesome and the action was great, minus a few CGI effects that were not that good.After a movie I love to go into the reviews and see how others have experienced the movies. I am greeted with at maximum 5/10 reviews, most are a lot lower.Not one of those really explains what makes the film so bad. There is a 2-liner that just says it is b-o-r-i-n-g and it gets 157 out of 258 ""helpful"".Most of the ""reviews"" here are just rants and still marked as ""helpful"". How is a rant helpful? How did it help you in any way?Don't get me wrong though, if you think this movie is a 1 or 2/10, I honestly don't know what to say to you, because there are far, far, worse movies out there, but hey, to each their own. I personally think that at least Black Widows production values are great, which already makes it at least a 4/10 in my book, but perspectives might differ.But I always thought this was a cinematic page with people capable of expressing their opinions and people valueing in depth analysis.This happens in most action movies nowadays and I am losing faith in my fellow movie lovers.Anyway, if you like movies from the MCU, give this a chance.Is it without plotholes? No, there are some to b found.Is it perfect with the best action ever seen? No, but it has great production values.Is this the next ""Godfather"" and the acting will rain Oscars onto the cast? No.But the movie is entertaining and I absolutely don't understand where the hate is coming from. I would like to understand it, but there are no reviews that explain it."
511,7,It was good The movie was good but not what you expect out of a Black Widow Movie. The villain again falls short of expectation like most of Marvel movies and yet again they pull a gotcha on their fans.
512,2,Wow! Great movie😁 I loved this movie😀! The acting was great😁. It was very funny and I was LOL that whole time🤣! Please watch this movie!😄 It was great!😁 Especially if you hate superheroes(please notice my sarcasm and listen to the rest of the ratings. Spare your eyes.)
513,10,"I LOVE IT! I understand why a good number of people didn't like this movie, but for me its great. Its even one of my favorite MCU movies. This is mainly because Black Widow is my favorite character and I don't care about Taskmaster."
514,9,"Very Entertaining The beginning will remind you of the TV show The Americans, where Russian agents as parents Alexei (David Harbour) and Melina Rachael Weisz care for Natasha (Johansson)and Yelena (Florence Pugh). This family has to escape as their cover is blown. Alexei goes back to Russia and be comes the Red Menace (Russia's version of Captain America), Melina goes to a farm and dabbles in controlling her pigs with mind control, and Natasha and Yelina go to be trained as Killing Machines under the control of Dreykov (Ray Winstone). The control of Natasha and Yelina is caused by a serum that allows Dreykov to control them. Later Yelina finds the antidote and sends it to Natasha.There is a good story here but most of the movie has Natasha fighting Yelina, and later both escaping from a Russian tank in the city and still later we see Natasha fighting with Dreykov's robot. All these fights are simply spectacular and the choreography is outstanding. You will be amazed at how good these brutal fighting scenes and excellent CGI scenes are. You know I was.Natasha is still a member of the Avengers, but is cast out as she violated something called the Sokovia Accords whatever that means. It is just a way of saying she isn't with the Avengers right now.Notables: O. T. Fagenle as Mason, a private contractor who supplies Natasha with whatever she needs; William Hurt as Secretary Ross who in the beginning almost captures Natasha; Olga Kurylenko as the Robot Antonia, and is Dreygov's daughter and he controls her with a chip he put into the back of her head.The family unites and all decide to go after Dreykov.I was impressed mostly with Florence Pugh as Yelina. She is very pretty, a good actress, a very good fighter and very pretty (You already said that). She will most likely get a staring role of her own and we will see more of this very pretty woman. (What. Again? )This is a fast moving movie and although there are many fight scenes, they are so good you do not mind however long they last.Very entertaining. (9/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: No.Nudity: No.Humor: There are moments.Language: No Rating: A (1 October 2021)"
515,8,"fine action It's a fine marvel action movie, scarlett is looking good, there are jokes, good action, some story, this is what you can expect from a marvel movie. Have fun!"
516,2,This movie had so much potential Can't believe how back Marvel messed this up. It's easily the worst movie put out by Marvel in the past few years.
517,6,"Average and very generic Greetings from Lithuania.""Black Widow"" (2021) had good actors doing solid work. All were good. But it was directing and story and script that left flat. Story was generic, villain was very generic, and there were no stakes basically. Actions scenes were OK, and i liked fighting scenes.Overall, OK movie to see it on boring evening once, and never return to it again. Not a bad movie for sure, but very average and generic."
518,10,"Best of mcu Marvel did it well this year with black widow j enjoyed each second action sequence,story line,performance all best."
519,10,All these super bad reviews are confusing The most common review is a 2? Gimme a break! For me this was by far one of the best Marvel movies. Felt very adult. Pity we won't see scarlet again.
520,7,"Bourne Marvel MI2 mashup First movie of any kind I've seen in two years due to lockdowns, yikes. Marvel movies are my jam and overall this movie has a few things going for it:+Some comedy +Is a Marvel Movie +Isn't WW84 (worst super hero movie, ever)Now the downsides -Movie took 1h 20min to get to main plot -Tried to be too much like Borne series -Tried to be too much like MI2 with fake faces -Weak antagonist -Acting on par with Home Alone 3This has been by far the weakest installment in the Marvel MCU. I've never actually seen Hulk but I imagine that movie is somehow better. Hopefully this isn't a sign of things to come."
521,3,"Even with WHITE WIDOW this film ain't interesting YEAH FOLKS this is a BORING movie. There was absolutely NO REASON to make that film; once you see it you will know.Maybe the agents of SCARJO convinced Marvel that she has a big following and they said ""ok, lets do this movie""... Or they put the stats down and said that there is a lot of momentum with female heroins now and that will defo make extra $ to poor marvel studios.So, who cares about quality anymore...right? They've done that part already. Quality: Been there, done that. Lets get some more cash.I think that the writers went for REAL CASH GRAB here. And marvel. And everyone else around this film."
522,6,Just a so so MCU movie Movie seems out of place/time since taking place right after Civil War. Taskmaster is a very mediocre villain and pretty predicable on the big revel. The only bright spots in the movie was Florence Pugh and David Harbour their characters were awesome and both actors seem to be having a ball filming the movie. It would have been really cool if Hawkeye had a flash back cameo in the movie.
523,3,"Quite possibly the biggest disappointment in the MCU A Black Widow movie is something I've always wanted to see as she is in my top 5 favorite MCU characters (she's my number 4 to be exact). She has developed a lot throughout the years and a stand-alone movie is something that is long overdue but now that we have one, I wish we never got one at all.Florence Pugh is fantastic in the film and is easily the best character, the first ten minutes was really good (opening credits were the best part of the movie) and the post credits scene was awesome but that's about it. Black Widow herself doesn't really do much. This is the last time we'll see Scarlett as the character and she feels reduced to a side character and She felt like she was just phoning it in for the paycheck.David Harbour is pure cringe here. He's not funny and his Russian accent is ATROCIOUS. Rachael Weiss is also in this film but she's given almost nothing to do and is devoid of personality to the point where you don't care about her. Taskmaster was okay but he was barely in the movie and has no character at all. He's only in about four scenes and combined, they last about nine minutes. Wasted.Early on in the film, they set up a sort of love interest for Black Widow but they just drop that character and he doesn't show up until the very end of the movie and the main villain played by Ray Winstone is just terrible. He has almost no presence throughout the film (which would explain Taskmaster being in the film at all because the film is so devoid of tension that if you've seen the trailer, you already know everything that's gonna happen in the movie) and there's very little backstory between the characters. Also, his performance was awful.The action sequences were pretty boring to say the least. It's just a bunch of shaky cam, quick cuts and choppy editing which is so ironic because it's a movie about a family of assassins who are getting revenge against the people who did them dirty. Not to mention, this film has probably the worst visual effects in the entire MCU. If you thought the effects in Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok looked awful, you haven't seen anything yet.Overall, Black Widow is a bad movie. It's boring and a waste of time and just might be the worst thing to come out of this universe. I'm still baffled by the fact that they made a Black Widow movie where Black Widow isn't even the main character, instead it's Florence Pugh. Are you nuts?"
524,1,I had to get this out ! Being a movie buff I just want to convey that this movies is BAD and Dumb at the same time. Just don't waste your brain here ! I hated this !
525,7,"Cool Marvel Movie! Very enjoyable Marvel movie. It's not gonna blow your mind if you're looking for a fresh, new idea, but it serves perfectly well.Scarlett Johansson is as good as always, and Florence Pugh's Yelena was actually a super cool inclusion.The movie was surprisingly emotional! The family dynamic was well done, but I'm not completely pleased about how they gave Natasha an actual family, because the point of her character in Endgame was that she had found her family in the Avengers.Sure, it doesn't break down any Marvel clichés, and it feels slightly samey, but actually this is a pretty cool movie.I don't understand the hate, I think there would've been so much less if this movie had come out when it should have, in 2017."
526,4,Long and just ok It felt like the story was neverending. Action scenes are good but the ending is boring and typical. Movie was just...ok.
527,1,What was the point I gave 1 star for Yelena. The only thing worth watching in this dull fest. 2 hrs 15 I'll never get back. Who gave this a decent review? Just because a movie has a big budget doesn't mean it's good. Skip it.
528,5,Full of exaggerated actions This movie is full of exaggerated actions. I know superhero movies are not something from practical life but this is beyond imagination.
529,4,"Black Widow strikes out Maybe it's because it came after Endgame. Or it could be that it was delayed due to COVID. But for me this film seemed out of place, and was a major disappointment on the MCU side, which we know of course makes quality entertainment in the past.Let's dive right in: The movie takes place directly after Civil War, and I'm going to say that small references like how Natasha got her vest that she wore in Infinity War do not bother me in MCU movies, only Star Wars movies so that was fine.The first major problem I had was Dreykov. Honestly, I thought that dude was dead. I really thought we didn't have to explore that storyline again, but here it is. Maybe if Black Widow was a prequel like Captain Marvel it would have worked better with that.One of the things I looked forward to seeing in the film was Red Guardian. Honestly, I can say they did not disappoint. He was more humorous that I expected him to be, but he is easily the best part of this film, his cluelessness and obsession with Captain America drive my favoritism of the character. Only one issue, he didn't have a shield in the film at all, and the action figure has a shield? Mistake much??I'm saving the worst for last, but let's point out the worst part of this film. TASKMASTER. When I heard Taskmaster would be in the film. I was ecstatic. I thought it would be cool to see a fight between Black Widow and Taskmaster, because Taskmaster has the ability to copy anyone's moves. I also expected him to be the main villain.But here we get our letdown. Minor flaw, Taskmaster is a woman. So the name Master doesn't fit. Would be better if she was called Taskmistress. But that's a minor tripe, Taskmaster could be female if the next issues I am going to list were not there. Bigger issue, she doesn't get a freaking line, and when she takes off her helmet, she looks like a prune face. Or maybe she's possessed. Either way, it just looks bad. She's also Dreykov's presumed deceased daughter. Way to re-tread the past guys, I thought we were still done with Dreykov. Biggest flaw with this character?? Her powers. Remember, Taskmaster was a character that had a photographic memory, he could copy anyone's fighting style by watching them.""Taskmistress"" gets her abilities from technology. Meaning that you insert a chip into her skull and she has the ability to copy moves. Seriously?? I expected something like that on the villain Ultron. But this? This just ruins the awesomeness of the character. I remember playing the Spider-Man PS4 game and enjoying Taskmaster on there more because he was at least accurate!This movie just seems like it should have been thought out more, as a result we get this in-between sequel that makes me wonder what direction the MCU is trying to go with that mid-credits scene. Don't say Multiverse guys, that could mean anything. We don't even know they next big-bad, the next avengers, etc."
530,9,"f u. i liked it I don't see whats wrong with one classic action movie, jam packed with action heroes, plot twists and some sentimentalism thrown here and there. Also, filled with bad a chicks. I loved it!"
531,9,"A great work from marvel studios. Seriously every single thing was perfect. It was really very great. Acting,Vfx,sound. I literally have no words to say anything bad about this movie. But just one wish that if avengers would have really came in the end then this movie would really be the greatest. And another thing I dont understand the endind ,was it a throwback to Yelena vs Hawk eye,if yes then seriously im dying to see that one."
532,8,"Why so many bad reviews?! I don't know what people expected from this movie that now they're disappointed (although I hope these people are ACTUALLY Marvel fans and have watched the movie) . I truly enjoyed Black Widow and would recommend it to any Marvel fan .It's an entertaining movie that gives you some perspective on Natasha's life before Avengers, it introduces the (possibly) future Black Widow and it has great action scenes. Give it a chance!"
533,6,Not bad but far from good It's an interesting take to the character of Natasha Romanoff. I think that there was a feeling from the movie Creator side to impress the viewer. That lead to something that was far from the spectrum of believable.
534,3,Scarlett Johansson Is not a good actress She is not and never was.Then you give her this obviously forced family drama with no story and things get worse.Bad combination.
535,9,A very underrated movie. I think the hatred towards this movie is very exaggerated and unjustified.
536,9,"Excellent movie One of Marvel's finest. Flowing action from the start, loads of humour and good acting. Can't explain the low score."
537,8,Good !!!!!!!! I really enjoyed it. It was really funny.
538,8,"Good Action Film to Watch for Non-MCU Fans Though I've got to say I cried throughout the whole film, it shouldn't deter you from seeing this action movie, because 90% of it is action as true to the genre. It's a nice movie to watch for an average audience that aren't part of the MCU fandom. The storyline is very heartwarming, similar to Captain America vibes."
539,1,"Worst Movie I have seen This movie is just bad. As a guy who like super hero movies everything about this movie was just bad. Just boring, terrible, unbelievable trash. Another thing Disney gets to ruin. Terrible and boring action scenes. Disney movies try to pull off these terrible ""funny"" moments when something serious is happening and it is always just terrible writing and lines the characters say and i just cant forgive this movie for doing those things. This movie has to actually be one of the worst things i have ever watched. Never, and i mean NEVER have i watched something this terrible and thought to myself ""you know i would rather have just sat and stared at a wall for 2 hours with my own thoughts than to have watched this utter absolute putrid dogshit pile of a movie. If you need a sign to tell you not to watch this Disney dogshit dumpster fire THEN THIS IS IT!"
540,7,Regis Henrique Pezão Muito parado. Em relação a personagem Viúva Negra.
541,4,"Where to start.... I like the character, I like ScarJo. I just dont like this. There are pacing issues, the script is awful, especially the clunky exposition. The new characters are all 2 dimensional, especially Draykov (whos name I had to look up, such was his impact on the viewer). The action sequences start off ok, but got gradually more ridiculous. This idea that CGI stunts can ignore the laws of physics is infuriating. Good CGI bends the laws of physics to the level of 'far fetched', but not beyond. Atleast a dozen times the film makers flew too close to the sun and from the half way point on, it was akin to watching fast and furious 10 (or whichever number they're up to now). The only reason I haven't scored this lower is because of the occasionally humourous moments. IMO The worst of the MCU films, with Shang-chi, Iron man 3, and Thor 2 following just behind. A disappointing last outing for a fan favourite character."
542,8,"Black Widow deserves a better solo movie This is soooo boring, tbh. I can't say any words. But still watchable."
543,4,Believe the hype! Everything they say is true; Black Widow is so boring and 45 minutes too long. Florence Pugh was the only good part.
544,3,"Overbred This is disappointing. It's not a good indication that the lawsuit its star, Scarlett Johansson, brought against Disney is more interesting than the movie ""Black Widow"" itself. It could've been different. It could've been a movie without any future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe of endless sequels. Like its deceased Avenger who's not even an Avenger at this point of a prequel. Like the sterilization the character was forced to undergo in her past. The selection of a genetically-gifted and trained life free from subjugation, with an individual identity, free will beyond procreation and the cycle of slavery, rebellion, and slavery again. Alas, Disney and Marvel have no interest in quality, stand-alone productions. They care about setting up the next episode, about copyright-extended brands, fecund intellectual property that may reproduce ad infinitum. Johansson's contract may be finished, but as the villain says, women are the one resource of the world in overabundance. Disney is that villain. It shouldn't take an incompetent publicity statement in response to a lawsuit to figure that out. Heck, it almost seems intentional that the villain resembles Harvey Weinstein, and Disney did own Miramax at one point.Despite the MCU having only two female-led superhero installments out of, what, 25 movies now and having still let the shambolic DCEU beat them to the punch with the first one, ""Wonder Woman"" (2017)--not to even count the two such DC movies before this cinematic universe stuff, I'm not saying Disney is particularly misogynistic. I'm not saying that here, at least. The corporate disdain for people is more general than that. People are the abundant resource, and they're in markets across the globe. Look at the generic map on the screen as the also-generic Bond villain elaborates on his evil, Soviet Hydra plan--I think the tvtropes website calls this the ""spreading disaster map graphic"" trope--it might as well be Disney's distribution blueprint: plant these ""Widows"" of no free will around the world to wreak havoc, effect the stock market, an' such. Speaking of tropes, too, the outcry over supposed ""fridging"" of Black Widow in ""Endgame"" (2019) was silly, but they really did it this time and in her own movie.Had the filmmakers realized and intended this, it'd be a different story, but I suspect as with the scenario of sleeper cells and the antidote freeing them, for a movie released during a pandemic, it was happenstance. Albeit, Jac Schaeffer wrote the story here, and she was the head writer behind the intelligently reflexive ""WandaVision"" (2021), tailor-made for its episodic TV medium. Not this time, though. The results are merely the usual MCU junk at lower stakes and the fight choreography is literally mirrored, as is the rest with a lot of ""The Winter Soldier"" (2014) recycling, like SHIELD another secret lair in the sky, climaxing in a jump that's hardly even as impressive as when done at the beginning of ""Iron Man 2"" (2010), a found family throughline that might as well have been ripped-off from the maudlin ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017), communists instead of Nazis for the aforementioned ham-fisted Hydra variation, even a prison break and an avalanche and throw in some ""Mission: Impossible"" while you're at (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it), for crying out loud, and an opening act that looks like it was made for TV, but not even the TV that did it better--i.e. ""The Americans.""I mean, look at those opening credits; that's a thematic TV-show montage. It's hideous. It's not surprising that a lot of the filmmakers behind this have TV experience. Heck, they cast that guy, O. T. Fagbenle, who plays the sensitive man in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" to essentially play the same role here, and that other guy, David Harbour, from ""Stranger Things"" where he plays the gallant father figure to a superheroic girl does that again here, too. And, that's not even to describe the end-credits scene.Rachel Weisz is too good for this, as is Johansson, so I'm glad she's out. How is this family-bonding schmaltz supposed to be heartwarming anyways--nonchalantly abandoning their children to be sterilized, mind-controlled and turned assassins for most of their lives, but, oh, they spent three happy years together in Ohio? Get out of here. At least the sisterly bond works well enough, and Florence Pugh's Black Widow 2 mocking Black Widow's being a poser is the only joke here that lands (heh, get it?). Besides, the dysfunctional family junk isn't even the most oblivious thing about another Disney-MCU corporatist abomination that pretends it's solved another societal ill. Sexism this time; racism and squatting, or borders, or something, the outing before last with ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" (2020). Throw $20 million at the problem; that'll fix it, right.On second thought, the worst thing about this might be that it also ruins the Budapest MCU story we never got, where now we're told that Black Widow and Hawkeye spent days confined together in cramped quarters and what they did was play tic-tac-toe. Overbred but sexless. That is unless counting the so-called (by Laura Mulvey, that is) ""male gaze"" despite a female director, with camera setups seemingly going out of their way to copiously focus on Johansson's posterior. Black Widow exits the MCU the same way she entered it. What a pity."
545,5,"Too long and disjointed There were some nice twists but overall the film was too long, tried to cover way too much ground, and ended up being a classic case of ""More is less"". Scarlet and Florence were enjoyable. David and Rachel were serviceable. But the movie bogged down the longer it went on. This is definitely not a film I'd care to watch again."
546,8,"entertaining I like the acting, and like scarlet Johansson, it's not going to be a classic,, but I found this moving entertaining. The bad points are the lack of explanation or defining the actual plots of the movie. I felt like the writers didn't think they had to explain anything."
547,7,"Good! But WHY? If I judge this movie as a random movie, then it's OK. It's good. I am giving a 7 out of 10 ratings by judging it as a random movie.But as an MCU Movie or as compared with the other MCU movies? No man. It's not necessary at all. Marvel just wanted to throw a movie out, so they throw this. They just wanted to introduce Yelena, the widow gang, and their parents. That's all. Nothing fancy!Yes, storytelling is sometimes boring. But it's not that bad. We don't know about Natasha's past life. Now we know that. And I guess this Yelena character is going to be interesting in MCU. Especially in the Hawkeye series."
548,10,Don't listen to hate This is a great movie. Not like every other Marvel film where you're just waiting for the next fight. The in between moments are genuine. There is an actual effort to build relationships. Guarantee the negative comments are just men who don't want to watch a movie with real content. 10/10.
549,6,"Not really a Black Widow movie Not a good villain, taskmaster ruined and more an introduction to new characters than an actuall solo Black Widow movie. It has its fun moments and characters, yet it does not stand out as a great movie in the MCU, leaving the feeling of dissapointment as the credits roll. Feels wrong that Florence Pugh and David Harbour was the best parts of a ""Black Widow"" movie."
550,4,Utterly Boring Not for the one second movie looked like a MCU movie.
551,9,"Pretty Good I feel like sometimes this movie is rated bad just because of the ""villain"" who's not even the villain, she's the victim. The real villain is Dreykov, he used her daughter like a trap to Natasha just to make her feel guilty. Also, this review sucks lol."
552,4,Is this Black Widow? What does it want to tell me? Natasha is beautiful or I made the wrong choice?🤥looking 4 forward to the new movie.
553,6,"Waste of a great cast The film revolves around a dysfunctional family that I had a hard time feeling any emotion for - despite hard work from a fantastic cast.The Russian shtick was taken straight out of an 80s American action movie, with the better parts blatantly copied from Killing Eve and The Americans. Yelena is so obviously Villanelle.The social message about the agency and exploitation of women was admirable but felt shoehorned into the story, especially in the final act.Overall I didn't really care for any of the characters, and the plot wasn't original enough to make up for it. Which is a tragedy when you've got Raquel Weisz, Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh on your team.One of the weaker Marvel movies unfortunately - and I really wanted to like it. The pigs were cute though."
554,1,"Oh dear what a shame Such a poor film, best avoided I'm afraid. Adds nothing to the franchise. No story to talk of. I must confess I do not like films with established characters that go back in time to tell a back story. Like Solo there is no jeopardy in that you know the main character(s) will come to no harm."
555,4,By far the worst Marvel movie The movie has a wafer thin plot and still extends its running time over 2 hours. The movie can help with crisper editing. One time watch if you are a Marvel fan.
556,1,"I want answers Can anyone tell me what is so good about this movie that it has got apparently high rating. Bogus acting, horrible plot and full of bogus CG's and so boring that I almost slept while watching movie, always trying to show to the world that Russians have always been more smarter and clever and evil genius than Americans. Please guys tell me anything good in this movie."
557,1,"What a waste of time This movie is really BAD omg a lot of scenes doesn't make any sense. The screenplay is awful. They put a lot of comic relief and you just ask why wth??? The ending what a joke, there is no climax nothing. The villain at the end is pathetic. The scene with the widows at the end is simply solved. There is no tension. If I qas Scarlet I would be glad that it didn't come to screen."
558,8,"Loved It First, #teamJohansson all day; she gave Marvel years of solid work and deserved to be given a chance at some real Marvel box office money, especially given this film handles the inherent feminist themes with far more grace and potency than Marvel's ONLY(!) other female-led entry. Second, I really wish all MCU movies from now on would be like this - simple, personal, great action, outstanding performances, high-emotional stakes / low existential stakes, and believable that all other Avengers wouldn't show up."
559,10,Actually really great It's funny and full of action. Florence Pughis fantastic as Yelena! I seriously don't know why this has so many bad reviews.
560,10,"An Avengers Story For the Ones Who Need Saving Human trafficking. Human slavery. Mind control. This movie is not only timely but unique. And the actors and action are so kickass. Family, dysfunctional yes. I was blown away. I was delightfully surprised. The story tied into my real world because I grew up in the Cold War. KGB spies, copycat technologies by east and west. This story should have been told much earlier in the MCU timeline. I'm glad I bought the Blu-ray since I can't go to theater. Kudos to the storytellers, actors, and everyone involved in the production."
561,6,"It's just forgettable Good action and acting but the story was just boring. The villain was lame also, there just isn't any real tension in this film. I honestly don't think I'll remember anything from this film a year from now."
562,6,"Lackluster film I had so many expectations about this movie...lost opportunity. Good special effects for an average action film, but script and character development were terrible.Verdict: wait until you can get it without paying the premium fee.My wife, who typically loves movies where women are highlighted as strong and independent, actually went to sleep halfway through the film.That should tell you how this one was a bit of a fail."
563,8,"Guys, lay off the hating So why all the hating? A female lead movie in the marvel universe? Or is it Scarlett?. Lay off, please. This was a good movie. Good storyline, well acted, well filmed, well directed and beautifyl choreography and photo. Could things have been better? Yes. In my eyes yes. Its been suggested that the Dark Widow had some deep personal issues. To skip over all the training and brainwashing and actually show what lay to grounds for this was a mistake, just showing some in blackflashes isn't enough for this character. This should have been two movies. But is still a great movie and there are a lot of trolls on IMDb."
564,10,scarlet OP always Masterpiece by a masterwomen.and yelena also performs op and their daddy so funny with actions 👍👍
565,7,"It's decent I guess I didn't want to watch this movie because I only really watch the Avengers and Spiderman movies and I thought it would be just cliche Marvel movie which it did end up being. I liked the plot and it kept me interested, however I was less interested towards the end as I thought the ending was kind of cliche, but that's probably because I've seen so many action movies. The actions scenes were good, some of them were unrealistic at times which I'm not a fan of, but I guess that's normal in movies. I'm not saying this movie is bad as I actually did find it entertaining, but it's not one of those movies I would reccomend as there are many more better movies, especially in the Marvel universe."
566,8,"A Fitting Send Off A great MCU film that is able to stand alone, although makes numerous links to the wider universe. A deserved leading role for Johansson after being a secondary character since the early films, however the spotlight is definitely shared with the introduction of some brilliant new characters.Pugh and Harbour play their parts to perfection, adding to the action but continually providing bursts of fun and humour. The exciting thing is that although this film brings a close to an enduring character, these instant fan favourites are given an opportunity to star in the future.The choreography is excellent, although for some of the more outlandish action sequences the CGI seems a bit wayward or the screen blurs. The plot advances swiftly allowing no time for boredom, and who'd have thought that Ray Winston could be a Russian villain?Things lose their way a little towards the end, and the Taskmaster isn't the most inspired villain in the world. It's hard to tell whether the accents are any good being an outsider, but you can definitely notice at which odd points the dialogue switches from English to Russian, there's little consistency there. Odd bits thrown in, such as whistling at the end which is either a callback to something that didn't happen, or to something that wasn't memorable.For all its faults, Black Widow does justice for a character that has served for so long. It's fun, it's exciting, and it's a good send off."
567,7,A bit disappointed A bit disappointed that this origin story did not explore more of Black Widow's past and would stand out a bit but it is an overall solid classic superhero movie.
568,8,"Black Widow is a really good MCU movie Finally at last!Scarlett Johansson gets her very own stand-alone movie that, fans of the Superhero/Fantasy film genre have been crying out for ages, for her MCU character, Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff, to do.And Black Widow does not disappoint. I've just purchased the 4K Blu-ray steel-book edition, and the overall production values; set & costume design of the action sequences (as expected from an MCU movie), are all top-notch.Black Widow is a most enjoyable spy-thriller-fantasy-romp.Made even more the enjoyable by several standout performances by obviously, Scarlett Johansson - herself, but also, Florence Pugh and David Harbour, are both absolutely terrific.And in spite of the most recent furore and controversy surrounding Scarlett & the Disney corporation. What I really liked the most about this Black Widow movie is the many levels of representation. Something which Kevin Feige/Disney/the MCU are finally catching up to speed on. Especially since, several of the other streaming networks, as well as, other film studios are all going to great lengths to readdress now.After all, there is only so many ""White orientated Male saviour films & tv shows"" that the global international market, can actually stomach.So Black Widow manages (quite successfully) to represent it's excellent female lead characters as strong and intelligent women. And not everything has to fall under the often creepy and pervy stereotype of the male gaze.Of course Black Widow will not be something that's best suited for everybody's liking.But what I really appreciated the most here, is the fact that, even if it is several year's too late (this movie should have been made 5 or 6yrs ago), finally we've got the kind of send-off, that, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow more than deserved.My only gripes are mainly to do with the fact that, Ray Winstone/Dreykov, was unfortunately totally miscast as a villain. Mind you, the MCU, has a whole back history of casting some very weak, extremely poor villains.And yes. Black Widow is a solid 8-out-of-10 movie.One cannot help but notice that, any movie that has been simultaneously released via Disney+ premiere access, has also received several negative reviews.Anytime some people have to pay extra to watch something, then they feel the need to vehemently complain and whinge about it.However a prime example of just how so many angry negative reviewers get so easily triggered is, the superb animated movie, 'Raya and the Last Dragon'.Which is actually an outstanding work of art. And 'Raya' has since been very highly praised."
569,5,"A Pointless Afterthought Bland and unimpressive, Black Widow was a below-average entry in the MCU. To care about the story, I must first care about the characters. Unfortunately, knowing Natasha's fate at the end of Avengers Endgame made my interest in her character falter.The film took a blind stab at Natasha's past while also trying to introduce new characters to the MCU. Unfortunately, nothing substantial was added to the story of Black Widow. The gravity of Budapest was lacking, the truth behind the Black Widows was ill-conceived and I was just bored throughout.There were a few unique moments of storytelling and some clever callbacks to other entries in the MCU. Florence Pugh was great, though all the fake Russian accents were grating at times.Had this movie come out right after Civil War, I would have enjoyed it more. Unfortunately, knowing the fate of the main character makes this film seem like an afterthought."
570,6,Not much to say This film while can be fun and entertaining is a very safe and follows the marvel formula.The story in itself doesn't progress the plot of the MCU and adds little to the Black Widows arc. Introduces some fun new characters that have potential in the MCU future but uses them very poorly or not at all (prime example being the Red Guardian played by David Harbour. A Russian super soldier that's obsessed with being back in his costume could've had extremely fun fight scenes with violence and extreme uses of strength but instead ends ups being the comic relief and the butt of the joke.) another example of characters not used properly is the villain Taskmaster. Made into a generic villain and has next to no similarities to its comic book counterpart.The end credit scene is the only piece of the movie that develops the MCU showing what could come next potentially for the Hawkeye series or further ahead.
571,1,Marvel sucks These super hero/villain movies are old News let's move on.
572,5,Meaningless & forgotten within 5 minutes No point in adding a review. It's just another one of those films.
573,10,"One of the best Marvel movies and you can't change my mind Finally Black Widow gets what she deserves! That took too long people!This movie is amazing. Excellent plot, cool action scenes, immaculate humor, and just in case that wasn't enough, they gifted us with the best sisterhood we could possible have ask for.Scarlett and Florence need a new movie together. That's it. The only thing bad about this one is that we won't see them work as sisters anymore.The low rating? Fragile men who can't deal with the fact that she is way more than a pretty face (and way cooler than Captain America)"
574,1,Wow This is embarrassing I only got 6 minutes in and had to pick something else.
575,6,"Who are these people? Red guardian fought captain america when?Who was the maternal woman of the ""family""?Who was the terminator woman stalking black widow in the ski mask, her real mom?Who the hell was that woman in the end scene, and how did she know about Clint?"
576,7,"amazing! I don't know why people are calling it useless. This was the introduction of yalena and yalena will be an important character in hawkeye series so why callin it useless. Also, the family reunion scene was so emotional."
577,2,"Barely a tiddlywink of interest I thought hey why not. I've loved every movie in the MCU so far. Not this time. Other than David Harbours Red Russian I couldn't care less about anything else going on. AT ALL. Makes me wish there was a better Mummy movie in the works for Rachel Weisz to be in, or at least a sequel to Envy. Now that was a fun flick."
578,10,"Amazing So amazing. Such a beautiful, feminist movie full of gorgeous cinematic shots🖤 So in love with everything about this film."
579,6,"Came in with low expectations but was surprised I didn't know too much about Black Widow before watching this movie, but from what I had seen of her in the Avengers movies, I wasn't expecting much out of this movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised! I really appreciated the way they set up the movie in the beginning and gave a bit of a background on her upbringing, it makes you feel more connected to her character throughout the movie! The acting in Black Widow was great as well."
580,10,"Do not understand the hate It worries me that I've been naive about the problem in equality as the old reason people could hate this movie is female leads, I just don't get it, I recently saw the new 10 rings film and thought that was the worst marvel film I've seen, not production, more just story and character wise, I found it cliched and sadly felt if you weren't blown away by the concept of the rings then your not going to love the movie, when I say my least favourite I mean 3-4/10 not unwatchable but not for me, then all the reviews said it made up for this film, I don't get it.Th effects were great, story was fun, the family were well cast and Florence Pugh was outstanding, I like sj and thought she was easily the most likeable I've seen her in marvel. Thought everything was perfect for an action movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean I don't read comics plus the lawsuit I think might cause other people to hate on this I guess but as a movie, just taking that into account with no outside issues then I don't get how this is any less than an 8.3. It proved yet again females can be seemless badass leads and can have great chemistry without desperately needing love angles, also this idea that women can't beat men up is silly, strength wise I get but if your a trained fighter, like top top level unless the guy is that level he's getting beat, don't get the problem with that, I'm also content with blokes being the bad guys but not for being men but just the casting, I'm cool with that, it's when it becomes man hating I reject it."
581,8,Worthy Watching Started watching with less expectations.Action scenes for every 15 minutes.I enjoyed the movie. Not disappointed.
582,5,"Not bad, just boring and intrascendent. This is by far one of MCU's worst entrance, boring and flat.One good thing about the movie is Florence Pugh's character which is fun and well built and makes you feel excited for her next appearance."
583,10,"Black Widow is BA! Loved this movie from start to finish! It was so great to see a film where the women aren't sexualized but instead intelligent, strong and meaningful! I loved the comedic sister character - the banter between the two were great. Also, loved that the film made fun of how Black Widow has been sexualized with her ""sexy"" pose strictly put in the past films for one purpose which was totally unnecessary! This film called it out so that was great! Exciting and adventurous- has action, humor and emotion! Love!"
584,4,"Isn't she already dead Few years ago Marvell decided to kill its superheroes and that includes Black Widow.When a person dies, watching the movie made earlier with them is not the prequel is mourning over the loss of a friend or a member of a family.The movie is about a girl raised as a professional assassin, who escapes her boss to live a normal life,the boss sends another assassin after her , but later the boss finds he needs her, and so they live happily ever after, wait this is not from this movie, this is a base story of 'Barely Lethal' that makes more sense whatsoever.No, this time the girl turns against the boss and wants to kill him - wait, isn't it the story from the movie with Angelina Jolie ?But, I suppose Scarlett Johansson is obliged by a contract to play a Russian, so be it, and if I were the Marvel bosses I would pay her that 100 mln of dollars without hesitance as she is the person that saves the movie.I would watch her, while she is reading a book, watching TV or even washing the dishes, (disclaimer - I don't consider it a feminine occupation,it can also be done by men ).Ah, men, so here is a bad guy, who has other people to wash the dishes for them, here is a fluffy bad guy, who looks like he doesn't even know how the dishwasher looks like, and a guy , who lives in a cardbox, hence needs no dishes at all.So all the dishes are left to be done for Rachel Weish, who plays splendidly, given the fact that she had to wear the bicycle in front of her body and pretend that it is a gun, she is going to protect her pigs with.Then there is Florence Pugh, Natasha's sister, another bright element in the movie.And I would love to see more movies with her, I only hope that the screenwriters would create the roles more coherent that this one."
585,6,Good but.... Once again marvel made a wonderful action movie. The story is good and touching but the last 30 min destroyed everything the plot twist wasn't that good in my humble opinion.The ending before the credits made me feel like I'm watching a Disney movie all happy and safe!!!*note* Scarlett should stop acting.
586,10,"Are we all watching the same movie? Honestly, I really don't understand all the other reviews! Why so much hate? This movie was wonderful. The foreshadowing, delightful humor, interesting characters and amazing acting was so much fun to watch.I really recommend it! I love the concepts so much and the ""family"" just got me so happy. Amazing details, great effects and exciting plot is what you'll find in this outstanding movie too. Sure, some plot points are pretty unrealistic and farfetched, but aren't we already very used to that from countless other movies? I don't see it as a reason to hate on 'Black Widow' so much. What's so wrong with the movie? I genuinely loved it so much!"
587,5,"Ugh This film is pretty bad. Corny jokes, random quips about the Avengers, terrible accents... Too many random characters - the film is supposed to be about Black Widow, no? But essentially she is nothing-burger in this film compared to the other characters.So much nonsense, forced situations that defy logic, the list goes on and on.Strangely, after seeing this film I want more of Florence Pugh. She's awesome. I hope she gets more action film roles."
588,4,"Super Boring Very poor content. Few acion scenes are good, apart from that nothing special in the movie. Its such boring that few might also leave this in between."
589,4,"Eric Pearson screenwriter Amazing action, good direction, the acting would have been better if the dialogue was better. Eric Pearsons screenwriting has destroyed every film that he has worked for. I think he must have been hired to destroy to Marvel films. I'm serious, lots of people say that."
590,1,FLOP Why marvel why. U need to step up your game. This isn't what wet are used to in terms of story and quality.The first 20 min are good. And that's it...
591,3,Nah. Average mediocre unnecessary film. It's so bad I d skip it even though I m an MCU fan.
592,3,Average to bad Yep it's true. MCU did an average film. Rather unnecessary. Not engaging and full of stereotypes.
593,5,"Average at best I guess the writers were on vacation, and they got the B team in to do the work."
594,5,"The weakest Marvel movie to date To much Cliché, to much feminist , I hope marvel's studios stops to make any movie like this anymore !!!!"
595,2,"killing me softly I started watching a movie. And I already understand. Hollywood, American viewers do not have enough of the Cold War, the war against Islamists is not enough, a new enemy must be found. The American nation must be feared. Now it's a neighbor, someone who lives next to you in Ohio, for example, and he's a Russian, a spy .... I wonder when the Chinese will be current .... It's especially disgusting to hire Scarlet in this role ... an old hen, which they use as ... disgusting!"
596,9,"Don't understand the hate I thought it was action packed, great character development, emotional when needed. I don't follow the comics so it was an interesting story. The only part I didn't like was the location of the Red Room. Beyond that, great movie!!"
597,5,Hmm Good movie.I like it Starting is boring But ending ia good.
598,7,"Not MCU best but solid I really enjoyed this movie, though it could be better but it was fine. Loved the Yelena character and she a great new addition to the MCU. Only problems I had was that Taskmaster wasn't that good and that this film should have happened after civil war.Also thank you Scarlett Johansson for her work as Black Widow over the years as it was a good send off for her character."
599,4,"A big disappointment What a waste of time!!! Can't image marvel mKing a movie like this!! It seems unnecessary, forcefully done. Bad storyline, uninteresting plot. Waste of so many talep. Only enjoyed the comim timing of David Harbour. A failed attempt by MCU."
600,10,"Glad they made this: you go Black Widow Not sure how to write reviews really. I'm a real fan of the choreographing in this film. From my eye it looked as like if the actors remained stationary they would have been hit (e.g. Nat's 1st fight scene lifting leg/knee to avoid fatal strikes feels more believable). I definitely think this compares well with ""Winter Soldier""."
601,8,Hindi dubbing is bad with punjabi dialogs It should more interesting if it was pure hindi dubbed.
602,6,"Such a poser The origin of Natasha Romanoff is explored in an action packed reunion with her lost family.I think Black Widow is an okay entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that has some decent cinematic moments, good character work, but also some key elements that let it down.I liked the basic plot and character arcs, which are set up well by a brilliant opening sequence, highly reminiscent of 'The Americans'. After that I think it gets a bit stop-start and hit-miss. Also, some scenes feel a bit too close to movies like Bourne and Kill Bill at times.I like the dynamic between Natasha and Yelena. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh have excellent chemistry and both give strong performances. It takes a lot to rival Johansson's presence, but Pugh certainly shares the stage with strong charisma. There are some great feminist themes, plus other allegories about the oppression of freedom, with the two lead characters plus others written well to translate them on screen.David Harbour and Rachel Weisz are both solid, particularly Harbour who adds some decent humour to a number of scenes. Not all of the jokes land, but he works as a bit of a comic relief in the midst of the more serious family dramatics.This is a matter of personal taste, but Ray Winstone does not work as a Russian villain for me. I guess there's somewhat of a Bond tribute going on, but the mumbled cockney-Russian dialogue felt endless at times. A bizarre casting decision.Another problem, and for me the biggest one, is the length and volume of action spectacle. Characters fall off multi-story buildings, have fights to look cool, suffer horrific car crashes, move in clichéd slow motion in front of massive explosions, jump off more things and fall and fall and fall and there's barely a scratch on anyone. There is a lot of extended, ridiculous moments of cartoonish action that disrupt the flow of the story.Outside of the excessive CGI spectacle, the imagery is mostly good. The cinematography, editing, colour grading and visual storytelling is all high quality.Overall I am disappointed as I think the Black Widow character deserves a better solo outing, but it is saved from disaster by the two leading ladies."
603,6,"Not what your expecting I have been a big fan of black widow ever since her first scene way back when. And have been looking forward to this movie for some time.Only to be let down by a wide verity of plot points that need explaining. First of all, Black widow (Natasha) takes a huge amount of damage in the first 40 mins of the movie, so much so that I might as well assume that Natasha is superhuman, she takes a bomb from under the car, a huge fight with taskmaster, falls from a roof and finally, she gets shot with what seemed to be an arrow, she should have been dead long before the end of the movie. I assume there was time off scene in between each action point. But at least tell me. As a viewer it seemed there was only a day between each event.Secondly, and I fear a lot of new movies will begin to fall for this easy mistake.Women can be badass, and Natasha is a prime example, but the fact that yet again in a movie aimed at depicting the women as the hero of the story, the antagonist is yet again an old white male. What a shocker. I'm sure this has links to the comics, but they were so eager to portray this narrative that they actively changed taskmaster into a woman just to show how evil this man is. ""Look the big bad villain is a guy and he's even willing to enslave his own daughter, men are bad women are good"" Look I get it, just stop shoving it down my throat, after seeing this format for a while now it gets stale.The red room in the comics is a huge organization aimed at making extreme soldiers, not just women tho, why they opted to make this movie and ONLY enslave WOMEN. Only provides proof that this movie was aimed at making men look bad. Such a shame.Aside from these, the movie contained great action, exactly what I was hoping for, Yelena has what I deem as an incredible back story that is both heartbreaking and badass simultaneously. I'm looking forward for more of her in the MCU.However I do wish I could have seen more widows in training, rather than just the end result and a small 5 min montage. Show me something real, something dark.Summary: Good movie, great action, poor story and obvious political agenda against men. And most importantly. BLACK WIDOW HAS TOO MUCH PLOT ARMOR. Stop with this guys, make it realistic, she's still only human."
604,1,"Boring as hell Too much family drama and cliche story writing, overall it's a worst addition to MCU. Black widow deserves better."
605,2,"only for Scarlett's fans Her 2005 and 2006 movies (esp. The island and Match point) were her best ones. Afterwards I didn't particularly like anything of her that I remember. Her casting as a ginger instead of a real one like Karen Gillan was bland. As bland as any of the changes of hair/skin color or gender of other known characters in recent cinema an tv.Casting her also as Lucy and Ghost in the Shell (this time dyed black hair), monopolising any female action hero really became annoying.Concerning now the character of Black Widow, she is not very interesting. I don't understand what is her point in the Avengers team. Besides showing Scarlett's derriere, (which has been already seen during the fappening times, and is probably not better than any of my neighborhood's women) BW has no special skills to justify her participation.The movie started rather well, but despite some good ideas for the plot, and some Marvelised action scenes, the rest was rather boring to me who had to watch the movie in pieces to finish it."
606,9,Good one After a long period i watch movie... I liked the movie ... Atleast one time watch.
607,3,"Plain Boring Disney and most of Hollywood do not understand that their need for revenue and filling space on their multitude of channels doesn't mean anything to us unless we are getting something interesting, something amusing, some eye candy or something that makes us think.When none of these elements is present we get a film like Black Widow.These Disney folk need to understand that soon they will lose us for good. Their contractual obligations, doing favors for their starlet assets and casting couches mean nothing to us.Black Widow wasted my time and felt like an extended episode of a TV crimi."
608,7,"UNDERRATED This isn't the best thing in the mcu. It has problems, but it gets too much hate. I prefer when marvel gets creative like with guardians of the galaxy and thor ragnarok but this movie is just fun. It is a good action thriller and doesn't deserve to be the lowest rated movie on IMDb in the mcu. My main problem with it is that the action scenes are ugly and boring. The mcu has some great and pretty action scenes but this movie resorts the the usual which isn't great. I feel biased towards this movie because black widow is my second favourite marvel character. Not to mention, the performances by scarlet johanson and florence pugh are perfect. Florence is perfect for the role of yelena and is maybe the best part of the movie. Rewatch this movie and rethink your opinions. It is a fun entry in the mcu."
609,2,"Break it up folks. Nothing left to see here. It's been said that the only legitimate philosophical question is in the form of ""Why is there something instead of nothing?"" Black Widow reverses the two subjects of that question.They have nothing left. They are just desperately finding characters to make more filler movies for their bottom-feeding fandom.I don't mean to dismiss anyone's experience in watching the film, but I found nothing intellectually challenging or entertaining about either the story or the interpersonal exchanges among and between the characters. Like a boring episode of 2 Broke Girls (but minus the pretty legs) this thing just drags on.And you don't need to be a soothsayer to figure out that critics are too emasculated to be able to be honest about a female-lead film."
610,5,"Disappointingly average Terrible editing, Taskmaster was butchered, and they somehow made Black Widow a soop. She's not a superhero. She is a highly skilled assassin. Even for a Marvel movie this is cheesy AF. I don't hate this film it just seems thrown together and 10 years too late. I did like the Red Guardian character and the humour brought by Yelena's character. She was the standout. It had fun moments but ScarJo shouldn't seek a further care as a producer. Yeegads."
611,10,"I love the way to tell her history, found it very amazing and fight scenes were breathtaking The history is very well written, the interaction between the them were very real, I love the way they show her story, perfect movie."
612,3,Storyline. Black Widow is not equal to Nikita series.This film story plot reminds just Nikita series. Her sister character resembles Udinov. MCU wasted our expectations after watching this. 🙏🏻
613,7,"Surprisingly decent I missed the opportunity to see BLACK WIDOW at the cinema and now I regret that decision. I thought it was going to be a forced effort, soaked in PC bull. It is a good action movie, with the sequences as good as you could hope for, and its family drama part at least resembles an effort of a human being. What I'm most impressed about is that Shortland managed to put her personal stamp on the project and still make a movie that belongs to the MCU (some of the indoor stuff reminded me of the Soviet cinema). Story and characters are believable enough that you care, which is, I think, a rare feat nowadays, especially in something as mainstream as Marvel. Harbour is a cliche, but an adorable one, Weisz is charming as always and Pugh continues to be a revelation and one of the better actresses to emerge over the past half a decade or so. The accent play left me ambivalent (Florence's hard 'r' comes and goes and I, as a Slav, am allowed to be a snob about it). I also don't know what to do with Dreykov's daughter (on that note -- when are we going to have an actual Russian criminal play a movie Russian criminal instead of all these Winstons and Brannaghs? I'm just messing with you -- I'm mocking these voices that have gained steam which suggest you can't do anything outside of what you are (if you're white, at least). Well, woke ladies and gentlemen of 2021, that's called acting and Ray makes for a convincing Russian roughneck (he even looks like one!) It's good to have a small-scale (super)hero stuff here and there -- it brings the things down to Earth, everything slows down and you can enjoy (and appreciate) the details (something I liked about the 1st season of DAREDEVIL). At the end, I send my love to Scarlett -- a dozen years in this universe is madness."
614,7,Don't know what it's getting hate Black widow movie does not have high action or big Villan that why getting hate or what it's it was released at time of iron man one thing where different for this movie dont have any problems with movie Convenient story and character Building but little Dramatic action sence are pretty good not that bad and visual are not So up to mark as marvel legacy but it's ground level Avanger movie what we Accept.
615,10,"An Action-Packed Entertainer From Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh !!! Finally, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) gets a story that is dedicated entirely to her and the one that takes us back to her childhood and the make-believe world that she called family. And she is not alone. Her younger sister Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), a Black Widow herself is still with the Red Room, but now she wants out and it's her elder sister to the rescue. In their quest to destroy a common enemy, they end up with their faux parents, Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) and Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz). This 'family reunion' is marked by double-crosses and an inevitable danger that could be the end of the road for Romanoff.Director Cate Shortland goes for the human story behind Black Widow's past and present and drives it well with all the action, peppered throughout. This is the reason why the film's high-tech and complex narrative feels relatable. Amidst all the mumbo-jumbo about the mind-controlling gadgetry and elite technology, capable of bringing in the new world order, what really hits home, is the simple connection between the two sisters and the longing they feel for a family that never was.While Scarlett Johansson plays her part with seasoned finesse, giving us a protagonist that is always easy to root for, Florence Pugh is extremely adorable. Pugh is a perfect fit as a slightly brash and spoilt younger sister, who despite all the elite training to become a Black Widow, retains her child-like innocence and charm. She also brings in plenty of sass and comedy, delivering effective punches, both comical and actual. David Harbour is a bit of a drag, thanks to his annoying character - a loose cannon, you know will spell trouble. Much unlike his onscreen partner Rachel Weisz, who is classy and understated as the unpredictable Melina Vostokoff. But collectively, it's their chemistry and the performances that work. Action wise, there is enough to hold genre fans and MCU followers and most of the chase scenes are edge-of-the seat. The action is slick and comes at opportune times. And all of this in a film led by women is even more commendable. Although the special effects, at times, don't match up to the standards we expect from this affluent franchise.Overall, Black Widow justifies its place in the MCU with an entertaining story that has drama, action and comedy, making it a Hollywood potboiler worth your time, all the way to the post end-credits scene that cannot be missed."
616,5,Underwhelming Black Widow was boring and underwhelming. Natasha was the only saving grace in this film. The characters are annoying and there's little that it offers fans. The story is set at a weird time during the MCU and in the end the film comes off as a cheap attempt to make more money off of a character that could have had her own (better) movie almost a decade ago.
617,8,"Enjoyable but too late I Almost didn't watch it from all the hate it got but it was surprisingly enjoyable, it doesn't really move anything forward in the MCU but it was good to see natasha again and explore her past and the red room as well as introduce yelena , the main problem in my opinion lies in the fact that the character is already dead so it doesn't really make sense to explore her origin after her death."
618,1,Meh I didn't Know there was a movie worse than Captain Marvel till I watched that film.Its Like hour And half of ( meh) expected The first minutes And ths song of The beginning and 3 stars only for it .
619,6,"Just for Scarlett Johansson This movie startes well, builts up the pace and later it just screws up with the story and there is nothing new to offer. The climax was pretty much like Bollywood Masala movie that could have been better. Little disappointed as i was waiting to see a good Marvel individual series."
620,8,"NOT ,ARVEL BEAST BUT NICE MARVEL ITS NOT YOURS BEST LIKE SHNAG CHI BUT THE FILM IS VERY NICE I SEE IT IN THATER IN JULY 7 I FROGT TO RIVEIW IT BUT ITS WAS NICE ONE BUY NOT THE ONE I WILL WANT TO WHTCH MORE THEN ON OR TWO TIMES BUT THANKS FOR BRINGING US SHANG CHI MARVEL I THINK YOUR GETING BETTER WITH YOUR FILMS EVERY TIME BLACK WIDOW WAS VERY NICE FILM I AM NOT HYPED FOR A SQWEL BUT IF THAT WILL GET ONE I WILL WANT TO WATCH IT MARVEL."
621,7,"Not bad.... I wouldnt say this movie is BAD overall, but man - these Disney/Marvel dudes gotta stop going over the top. This was sort of supposed to be our ""grounded"" answer to the last few marvel movies. I mean...Trained Assassins infiltrating a base? That was such a cool premise for the final act. But nope, they had go create a giant explosions, something falling from the sky, and the characters being immortal."
622,9,"Once again worthy of thy eyes This actually brings back memories of the hero who sacrificed her self for the love of the remaining half of humanity,it's only fitting we get to see👀her least on last time before they close her chapter,who would have taught she head a twisted past,and hat life was also a mess,but in the end we got ourself a heroine 💔💔."
623,6,6.2 I liked it. Wish they went more solo with it and made it more about Black Widow.
624,1,"Fast and ferious 163 It was too bad a movie to be befitting Marvel quality. If we remove the CGI scenes, the movie will be about 3 minutes in total. The script is bad, the acting is bad. It's a BAD movie."
625,1,"Beyond underwhelming The MCU has introduced planet eaters, infinity stones, all sort of god like creatures but for some reason they think that well over a decade of such movies they can excite me with the story of a 5'4 Russian girl who is really athletic and has ninja spy training.Seriously now this movie is boring and underwhelming even compared to any MCU TV series episode I mean those have been a lot more grand in terms of their plot than this nonsense. The Black Widow origin story should have been among the first/earliest MCU movies to be made not the most recent ones.It made no sense for it to come out now."
626,5,"MCU Version of a Filler Episode I would never label a Marvel film as ""uninteresting"" (except for the first two ""Thor"" installments) but this needless chapter gets close.While the MCU has never revolutionized the wheel in terms of storytelling, there at least has always been a sense of discovery and progression. ""Black Widow"" only spins its wheels doling out the same tired formula that has continually plagued the solo installments of the ever-expanding universe.Director Cate Shortland embraces the spy genre but doesn't offer anything interesting with the unlimited budget and talent at her disposal, with her greatest sin being the absolute wasting of Ray Winstone as one of the most pathetic MCU villains (already a low bar to begin with).Fortunately, the introduction of Florence Pugh as Yelena offers some semblance of hope in this new age of heroes."
627,2,"A film that was not needed. When they first announced this film I was super excited for it as I love Black Widow and I love her character from the comics and I wanted to see Nat/Black Widow in her own movie finally. So the trailer dropped and it looked interesting as they were talking about the Red Room which is very key to Black Widow in her comic book storyline and I was like, ""We finally going to see her connection to the Red Room and the brutality she had to go through"", so this got me hyped and excited to see it. So finally the movie came around and was ready to see it and had real high hopes for it. My god, I wish I never had high hopes. What a train wreck of a movie that was like completely pointless, completely pointless and not needed. If you are going to make a Black Widow movie, do it about her origin and the Red Room, that is what every fan wanted, to see her origin in the Red Room. But Disney was like no let's not do that let's make pointless film set between Civil War and Infinity War, which story and saga is done and over. It was pointless and Nat wasn't even the main character in her movie, it was Yelena then Red Guardian then Nat, like I'm not even joking. Yer it's a watchable movie and it's Marvel but it's a terrible send off to Black Widow and that makes me terribly sad."
628,9,Watch you will not regret Fight and comedy on point.you will love fight scene.
629,7,Not as glamour as other mcu film but still entertaining Maybe you'll not find this movie as glamour as other marvel cinematic universe film but this is still a good action movie that will cheer all black widow fans who embrace black widow as a one of our favourite super hero woman.
630,4,Worst MCU movie A total wasted opportunity. Not really sure what they aimed to do here. Feels like a cheap aimless movie when she had such a big potential to explore her background. Story felt dumb and awkwardly told. I feel like they owed a lot more to this character and actress.
631,3,"They could have skipped this one... I must start with saying that this is the worst MCEU movie of all. I dont know what they were thinking while making this. Everything here is way below Marvel's standard, no storyline, very plain acting, fight scenes are not impressive at all (they should be considering its a Black Widow movie), flat and uninteresting dialogues, bad direction and screenplay, everything is below average. It was a long wait for this movie and the end product we got after this much wait is a disappointing one."
632,2,"Unnecessary This Disney+ thing is really desperate for 'Content,' isn't it?The janitor in Iron Man is going to get his own movie soon.The Black Widow in w.h.i.t.e! Is just boring and tries hard to be a family drama. Well, if you liked this then you will love Little House On The Prairie! Mark my words."
633,9,"Yeah the movie was great Yeah it was great, unfortunately, not just the way I expected, the perspective was really off, didn't make a lot of sense."
634,4,"You can't fix stupid As the saying goes, you can't fix stupid and that seems to hold true for the most recent movies from Marvel... this one included. Marvel no longer seems capable of making movies with witty dialog, compelling stories, or interesting plot twists. They just offer up the same old cliches and tropes, along with over the top CGI and mind numbing ""action"" (I use that word loosely, because real action is not suppose to be boring). This movie did have some bright spots, which is why I rated it a four instead of a one, but they were few and far between.I was also saddened by a few realizations regarding Scarlett Johannson: 1. She's let herself get plump. Maybe she always was and I just never noticed since she was part of an ensemble rather than the main character.2. She has large nose.3. She's rather a Plain Jane."
635,3,Total snorefest I almost fell asleep watching this 'action' movie. Can't believe I had to wait so long to watch this movie.
636,9,"Dramatic and compact finish Although scarlett johansson appeared a bit weak, but the whole movie was very, very acceptable and had some action scenes, I liked it very much and I love it."
637,1,"Go n watch falcon n winter Soldier Worst of mcu, weak storyline, comic task master will suicide by seeing the cinematic... Supporting characters are haha funny... End credit scene is lame no future for BW bye bye."
638,6,"Two Fireplugs Interesting.The new female action heroes are two small - 160 + tips - sturdy fireplugs. Pugh and Johansson. Not the long legged Wonder Woman - au contraire. Not specially graceful, but powerful with their short legs and stout things and derriere.I like that. It´s quite an implausible look for action stars. New standard.They are of cause really talanted even with a script like Black Widow, that made no sence. Why were the in Ohio, who chased them and what happened then. Some mindmanipulation? Some strange pink mist that did control widows and made them braindead? Not a clue. And the family and their behavour? Flopping between this and that."
639,7,Not Lots of Action Scenes but not bad Too... It's Truly Great Film. I Have Seen That Lots of Negative Comments are Coming In The IMDb for (Black Widow). I think this All Negative Comments are Camed For Not Have A Lots of Action Scenes. But It Doesn't Mean That Every Superhero or Heroine just Needs To get or do Fight in the films. Some Superheroes are There Who Are Just Focusing to Save The World.So Good. I Have Watched It With My Mother. And Mother also Like It.You Also Need To Watch. It's a Must Watch Film. Great!
640,10,Excellent Only neck beards who hate women are ragging on it. Movie was awesome.
641,10,"Loved it!!! Along with Thor Ragnarok, it is my favorite marvel movie! So much better than the cookie cutter films we have had."
642,5,"Lame and pervy villain, Horrible CGI Movie was alright other than the villain. Dude was so weird and pervy, and his motivations didn't make sense, and kind of ruined the entire movie. After learning about this dude, I went back to start and skimmed through, and the fact that he had all these serious soldiers employed for his pervy schemes was ridiculous. It kind of works if you don't know the villain and their motivations, but once you do the movie becomes a joke that takes itself too seriously."
643,1,"BORING THAN SEE 10 HOURS OF PAINT IN A WALL Its simply Boring, this just take 2 hours of my life away, im waiting the secuel to give them a bad review. Dont look this is bad, longer and they dont paid good a the actors."
644,3,Filler Mistakes:Black Widow in white is acting in a family dramaI mean she was useless in all marvel stories anyway just doing rolls and jumping jack squats for who knows why...Give it up. It was boring and I should have known better.
645,6,"This would be better 5 years ago. Why release this movie so late. Why make the movie so boring in the end. I know am an old person. But this is a Marvel movie WITH SCARLET ""GORGEOUS JOHANSON"" I was so bored, and I even pull my phone to know how long the movie was. Please just run after the start of the credits. This is by far the worst post-credit scene in a marvel movie."
646,9,"Good one Surely , imdb rating what is happening..Dear Megha movie rated 9 star.. & This one 6 ... Unbelievable imdb rating are not at all accurate now a days..."
647,10,"Don't miss it I don't know why so many people saying it's not a good movie... I agree to disagree with them. It's a good movie and in the entire run time I didn't feel bore even for a sec. Calm down ur comic expectations and watch it, you will find it good. 👍👍"
648,10,"A True Family Movie The story is one of the more captivating, hit home stories from the Marvel Universe. Took my daughter and her 1st words after was ""I love this movie"". Touching while bringing in story lines from previous movies. Lead characters played strong roles. Scarlett was awesome as always. Such a diverse actress. This movie had serious moments as well as very humorous moments that hits home with a growing number of families. Not sure a better family story with deeper meaning has been written with any Marvel movies. I consider this one to be the least action filled but one of my favorites. Marvel continues to pleasantly surprise."
649,8,"Very good retrospective origin for Black Widow The story perfectly shows why Natasha is much more than a super trained geopolitical tool, that she rather has a unique strong heart that points to the right place and why.It also introduces a great potential hero in Yelena Romanov. We are really excited to see her as part of the MCU, hopefully eventually as replacement of her sister within the Avengers team.In general, we enjoyed it very much.I don't like how Disney manages to make a clown of the father everytime."
650,10,"Relative to the real socialism, is Scarlett Johansson like me? Black Widow doesn't just have grace and meaning, it has a modus operandi -stopping at what you have.From Natasha's nose-bleed, in front of Dreykov, to the pig's torture in front of Melina, to the plane's hiccup take off, at the beginning of the movie, to Natasha's ability to survive her fall, so that she can see the stop of her ""soulmate"", the theme of the story is stopping at what you have, which is inevitably a socialist heaven.The banter, between Natasha and her fixer - more of the same, stopping at what one has. The agreement and non-fighting between the Taskmaster and Natasha, an inverse of poetry which is the same - stopping at what one finally has, and having it through the absence of reason, the socialist heaven.The movie is a flurry between opposites - stopping at what one has, and a sudden interruption of peace.My sudden interruption, of my peace: Lawsuit or no lawsuit, can Scarlett Johansson be me?To reiterate: opposite or no opposite, the theme or pattern of Black Widow is to end at the having, not before or after the having, but at the having. Presumably, this can relate to the idea of socialism being the true evil of reality, of the universe. Not of society. Not of culture. Not of left-right politics, but of the mysticism of reality.Relative to the real socialism, is Scarlett Johansson like me?"
651,1,Bad Horrible movie and cringe acting. Very disappointed.
652,1,"Waste of time, resources and waste of what could have been a good character I dont know what they were thinking while making this movie. The generic direction and fight scenes are so bad. The script is awful and clearly focusses in lazy written jokes instead of focussing in character development for a character that have been waiting 10 years."
653,6,An average film This is not a very good or bad movie..its an average movie..I except more frm marvel..story was not that much great bt Natasha nd her sister just superb...
654,5,"Very mediocre Opens strong, with a flashback and a great action sequince.Than it takes a HUGE dive in quality, turns into a mediocre action movie that is written around the action scenes instead of being written around the character.Red Guardian is portrayed as an absolute idiot. Not just a patriot, no a VERY dumb patriot. For 'comedy' purpose I guess, but it all just falls flat.Her lil sister is being set up as the next black widow.......yea we get it Marvel....you don't want the money to run out.....And finally they ruined a favourite of mine; Taskmaster is being reduced to a mute with zero personality who just is there for plot reasons.If we didn't have the Ms. Marvel movie, this would've been the weakest Marvel movie."
655,1,Worst Marvel Movie to date !! I mean how can they just approve such a flimsy and immature movie plot to get the green light from marvel executives. Just the worst experience watching a Marvel movie. Never felt so let down while watching a Marvel movie and yes I have watched all of them.
656,4,"Black WidOh Hell No! Watched this today on Hotstar & it was not up to the MCU standard. Is the MCU going downhill after the endgame? Only ""God""(Disney) Knows!? The story was been there done that but action scenes are pretty much enjoyable. I was going to watch this mainly for black widow and not for her sister. The jokes are very childish & they ruined the Taskmaster who could be great as a main villain for a MCU movie & not just some boring old man's right hand. Overall it was below average."
657,1,They have must switched from Marijuana to cocaine They got out of ideas and they just simply put one stupid idea on top of another.
658,1,"SO BAD. Feels like out-of-touch old men designed and produced it This movie feels like the story and screenplay were written by men who didn't understand women at all, which is both bad for a movie all about a woman AND regrettable since technically one of the three people behind writing the story and screenplay was a woman.It is disappointing that this movie takes one of the strongest women in the Marvel cinematic universe and gives her a backstory with plot holes. Somehow the ""test"" that got her accepted into Shield was unsuccessful but no one thought to check? And they never really explain how?It takes one of the only women in the avengers and makes her uniquely susceptible to the pheromones of an old man in his sixties. Which just feels creepy, and also rather demeaning to her character.It falls victim to one of the classic blunders: while it does not enter a land war in Asia, it does take a powerful character and make ""not being able to have children"" a major personality trait. This wouldn't be bad in and of itself, but because they have never made any of the men in the cinematic universe have this sort of an issue or personality trait, it does come off as uniquely insensitive and seems to be unintentionally (or intentionally, I don't know) suggesting that powerful women have a portion of their value tied up in whether they can produce children.On top of that, it gives her a backstory that is frankly not nearly as cool as that of practically any other avenger. I like the family dynamic, but you have to admit, having three years of fake family and then nothing else other than being ensorcelled by a villain and escaping to immediately join Shield seems more like the stories given to Marvel villains than to actual leading characters. She had no agency, no character building; all she was was a girl who did what she was told and then switched sides and did what she was told by the other people. No dramatic hero story, no ""with great power comes great responsibility.""Lastly, the movie contains a lot of filler, with action sequences that seem all about blowing random stuff up, starting avalanches, and stretching out the action instead of actually being unique or including enjoyable super hero fights. Which is fine in a Fast and Furious movie, but not exactly what one hopes for from a Marvel movie."
659,5,"Not the best Marvel movie... I watched this at home on a large screen and a surround sound setup, which is important to mention because these films are built from the ground up to excel in a theatre. Having said that, I have also recently rewatched all the MCU in chronological order (Captain Marvel - Loki) on the same setup and generally all the films were fantastic.While there isn't anything particularly wrong with Black Widow, there isn't anything particularly good about it either. There's the standard paint by numbers plot and there is never really any sense of danger or genuine suspense. The antagonist never really convinces and the obsession with big cgi explosions evoked Iron Man 3, another dud in a generally excellent catalogue.The character Black Widow is arguably sidelined here as there is very little meaningful added to her background, and the film becomes about the supporting characters and their arcs. There is some witty dialogue, but in the end it feels like just another mission for Natasha Romanoff.I watched it to the end just so I could see the post-credits scenes."
660,7,"Agree with many others on average rating It's not the best Marvel film, and the weaknesses are there to be seen for any Marvel fan that expects greater things. I'm sure with hindsight Marvel see them too. But it's an important film for Hawkeye and continuing the MCU into the next phase."
661,2,"Unrealistic In 2021, people are not fools anymore. They can't keep on producing unrealistic movies and stories and expect people to accept them."
662,2,"Weak I could not get into it, the movie was ok but not great, her acting kinda sucks in this movie, she need a better acting coach or something, i did not feel this movie at all taskmaster could have been better as well, this movie should have been for free from start, the soundtrack was good though lol, i would not recommend this movie as great but as something to let the little girls watch when they are acting bad and and you need them to get quiet at home...boring boring boring."
663,1,"Thank god she's gone Pls tell why I would go see a movie about a non super powered dead bic who doesn't even scale to Ironmans mark 1 cave suit. Maybe if she was a political assassin pulling strings like a puppet master. But no that's too ""complicated and divisive"" but hey can we get a hallelujah for not ever having to see sj face in the mcu again."
664,2,"A ton of dumb marvel movies clichés. Gender swapping Taskmaster was the biggest insult to all comic book readers. And to add insult to injury, taskmaster was a pawn all along as opposed to being a formidable character from the comics. Marvel movies have started going downhill since Endgame."
665,5,Okay Film It lacks the punch and its a bit overly melodramatic.
666,6,"Widowed I refused to read any of the negative reviews before I had seen this first hand. For a side story, I enjoyed the story itself although part of me thought that some of the avengers would make a cameo appearance. This is was not the case.I enjoyed Florence Pugh's performance (Yelena Belova) in this. Both she and Scarlett Johansson (Natasha Romanoff) stood out. The cast did a decent enough performance and I feel the critics are gathering their pitchforks due partly to the delays & the omissions of cameos from the avengers franchise. The plot is predictable and the trailers may have shown too much to the detriment of the film.Overall, it is watchable and I shall miss seeing Scarlett Johansson from future MCU appearances! There is no doubt it will be compared to the DC's wonder woman film. It has more than stood its ground to its counterpart."
667,4,"Wanted to enjoy this so much, but I didn't Pros: Scarlet looking fine as always. The awesome remake of the song: Smells Like Teen Spirit.Cons: Bad and cheap plot, superboring villain, washed out jokes, bad acting except from Scarlet and the ""kids"" in the beggining, annoying accents, alot of loose threads, predictable, alot of just unnecessary scenes/happenings, CGI looking kinda cheap at points... I could go on forever I'm afraid...Really a big fan of Marvel, so this was really dissapointing. Feels like a high-budget action-movie, but with plot, directing and cutting made by 12-year olds."
668,10,"Natasha Romanoff Saga... Awesome... MUST WATCH... Cinema is back! Marvel is back! Natasha Romanoff is back! There's so much excitement going on all at once that it can be overwhelming. Marvel's latest-the long awaited Black Widow-is set during Natasha Romanoff's (Scarlett Johansson) exile period, after Captain America: Civil War left the Avengers divided, and Nat is on the run from Gen. Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt).As well as fleshing out Nat's backstory, the movie introduces us to Yelena (Florence Pugh), Alexei (David Harbour), and Melina (Rachel Weisz), setting the four on a mission to locate the Red Room and destroy it and its creator Dreykov (Ray Winstone). It gets a bit twisty! But how does it end, and what does that Black Widow ending mean for Yelena, Natasha, and the MCU? We'll have a go at unpicking it."
669,2,Sordid rubbish Me: Hi NatashaShe: (comes cartwheeling and doing jumping jack squats)Me: Why did you do that? You were two meters away from meShe: I am the most useless character in MCU so I am desperateMe: Walmart is hiringShe: I failed my interviewMe: So audiences pay the priceShe: I give them value though! I am the Black Widow in White!Me: (Vomit)
670,4,No thank you All the jokes and gags fell flat. The accents were painfully bad. The story and the acting was standard. This film isn't worth sitting for over two hours. BORING.
671,8,"It was a good shot by MCU It was a good movie , more realistic with a short story which is little bit eloberated, But still it was worth watching ✌ I'am now wondering why bad reviews are here , seems like MCU haters got organised."
672,6,Expected more Hardly any back story. Felt like the story was a bit rushed.
673,5,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT Honestly everything is unlikeable about this movie, i expected too much from this but it didnt crossed half of my expectations. How can you waste a character like taskmaster, probably the worst movie villain ever, the story was ok but its all over the place, i personally couldnt connect to the movie. Im giving 5 stars for casts performance and vfx but nothing special in this movie."
674,6,"poorly operated by creaters I might say it was disappointing watching this type of graphics, the plot of the movie is so good and interesting but the poor treatments makes it 6 to 7 in ratings."
675,1,"Fake case for publicity The screenplay and poor story of this movie, made it worthless for cinema. This movie predecided for OTT platform, Scarlet Johannson filed that case just for publicity of this movie,"
676,8,"finally we get WOMEN I don't know why the ratings are so low, i just know it's all men being unable to handle a well done female focused marvel film. Compared to captain marvel, i didn't love, and wandavision- which really did love up to the hype- black widow really served. I think some of the plot points felt a bit castaway (really wish there was more backstory to the black widows and Natasha's childhood pre-America). But i really loved the character and family interactions- the cast was picked SO WELL (i cannot stress this enough)"
677,6,Below expectations MCU I expect you bit more than what I have seen in Black Widow. The movie wasn't really bad but nowhere near to past MCU movies. Story was badly portrayed. You just wanted to infuse new black widow and for that you made whole movie... Things could be much better ...
678,6,"Invigorating and engaging Engrossing action sequences Exotic locations Exciting storyline, at least in the first half Emotional moments too.ENTERTAINING (okay as usual nothing kills protagonists) Well, this one ticks a lot of boxes according to me."
679,4,Not her Not black widow i know. Leave it. Even for marvel fans.
680,6,Its late If this movie would have came before like Endgame or just after it. It would have got so much more because its a great movie but the delay in release just lowered its connect.
681,8,"LOVED It. Don't Understand Why So Many NEGATIVE REVIEWS. As we all know it is set after the events of Civil War and before the events of Infinity War. A MCU fan like me shouldn't complain for the late release (5 years after Civil War) of the film. The new white costume of Black Widow was really looking great. Loved Red Guardian & Yelena. By the way, the identity of Taskmaster was predictable for me.Don't understand why it received so many negative reviews. It's funny, entertaining and very emotional. Many were complaining about the weak villain. But, I think as Natasha is just a trained agent and not a super soldier or a God or has power of any infinity stone, it was good decision to take a not so strong villain. I totally loved it.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.© MandalBros."
682,6,"A Nice Day for White Widow? So, along comes a Black Widow movie, a day late and a dollar short.Yes, the film falls short in my opinion and I just can't put my finger on the why...is it the writing, the acting, the pace, the production values? All the elements are there for greatness, and really, Black Widow is just a few scenes short of awesomeness. But no, it is the overall lackluster concerning the film. No one seems to be invested on-screen or behind the camera. It feels as if everyone just showed up to collect a paycheck.However Black Widow is not without merit - the action scenes are just great. A nice blend of live action and cgi, which is rare these days. And Ms Johansson, burdened with the bulk of the acting in the film, holds her own like the action star that she is. Actors David Harbour and Rachel Weisz do their very best to keep us engaged with their limited time on screen, I would have loved to have seen more of them.As much as we all love Scarlett Johansson, her presence cannot save this film from being just an also-ran. It gets a participation ribbon. It's checked off the list, so to speak. Which is kind of bittersweet really, Black Widow finally gets her own movie but it seems the venture is just a going-through-the-motions type of movie. But hey, they did get my money, and if Scarlett does another Marvel movie ever, I will spend money on that one too."
683,6,💩💩💩 One of the most overrated of Marvel movies in history.
684,10,"safe to say i cried. Overall this movie was amazing, i've been watching marvel develop this character for years and today ( actually on july 7th) i said my goodbyes (heartbroken emoji) i'm going to miss her soo much!"
685,10,Amazing film Forget all the bad reviews. I think every minute of the film was worth watching.
686,9,Full action packed 👌 Fully action packed fast pace movie 🎥 Action sequences are way too good. Don't know why people rating this movie very low. I think it's all about taste. Definitely deserve more rating. Scarlet did great just like always but Florence seriously surprised me. Wasn't expecting that level. Hat's off 👌👌👌👌👌
687,10,"Dear Natasha Romanoff When this movie started, I was having a lot of fun. As the movie progressed, my excitement increased and in the end, what I thought was that she left you. I really miss her very much and I know that I I will never be able to see my favorite Avenger really miss her so much#Blackwidow#Natasha."
688,5,Even Thor 2 was better than this boring peice I seriously expected alot from marvel movies. A huge letdown.
689,2,Logic is outta the window with this one The whole movie is an absolutely mockery of the viewer intelligence with a lot of dumb scenes I'm not going to spoil. I'm a Marvel fan and I appreciate the fact that other marvel fans are rally to defend this movie but you can't just support something blindly especially not this terrible movie.
690,5,"Action stuff... No story as other marvel movies, only action scenes can be appreciated. This movie made to introduce new characters that's it....."
691,7,"Stepchild Natasha Romanoff Marvel Presents:)) Iron Man,Captain America ,Spider Man,Black Panter,Thor,Doctor Strange, this movies lead roles never dying but natasha first movie dying too. Maybe too,Natasha is from russia, finally russia big enemy:)) Wish, her tomb in third movie , if we saw.. I'm unhappy for natasha but I'm hapy for Scarlett Johansson because the Best Actress Oscar nomination didn't come from a Marvel movie. You know what, I'm hopeful we'll see Romanoff somehow in the 2nd or 3rd movie or a movie set in a goddamn alternate universe. There are two types of movies, good and bad, and why isn't this movie better?"
692,6,"It is Ok, but not a good goodbye for Black Widow after her death I have seen it for two times and just felt good for first 20 mins. So sad for Taskmaster could not be described clearly and had no dialog. After watching this film, I still had many questions for it. It should have been made better because it's the last Marvel movie of Scarlett Johansson."
693,10,Awesome Loved it. Black widow is funny and action packed fun. My kids love her too.
694,1,More woke Disney garbage The first 15 minutes actually had me interested by 35 mins in I was like these idiots are so woke they can't even tell a story. By an hr in my wife said this is complete garbage and thats an honest review.
695,1,Actually the worst marvel movie in the past 5 years. Cheesy and the cgi was awful for a movie with a 200 mil budget looked like it was directed by michael bay.
696,1,"truly bad Somehow, marvel has made a film worse than the abomination known as new mutants. Just stick to aliens vs predator requiem please."
697,1,Bad Honestly found everything about this movie to be unlikeable. The storyline was all over the place. The fake accents were horrific as well.
698,1,"sigh When I left the theater, I felt both empty and annoyed, and I really wanted to get my money back! Why? Because Black Widow is All About Bashing Eastern European, White, Men! In the world of the Black Widow ALL the men (except for one minor exception) was White, Slavic AND either pure evil, pure dopey, pure mindless automatons or purely neglectful - or some combination of the above. There was not a single man I could identify with for more than a split second. Which is so ironic, since the audience for this film is gonna be made up of mostly White men. The women, on the other hand, are all good, severely victimized, mostly young and all beautiful in their multicultural glory. Why do bad guys only recruit beautiful women? If I were an average looking woman, I wouldn't be too happy with this outdated and ridiculous stereotype, either. And, without exception, every single one of the women in Black Widow was severely abused by older, White, Slavic men. Talk about needing therapy!One of the main characters is the usual, and totally predictable, evil maniac. He and his associates are, of course, all Slavic men, with bad Russian accents. I am a second generation American of Eastern European decent and I'm sick and tired of seeing Eastern Europeans with beards being portrayed in American films as homicidal lunatics. It's offensive. STOP IT! It's really bad film making. It borders on antisemitism. You cannot have the good people being multicultural, but all the bad folks being exclusively from one gender, one race and one ethnic group. That's only common sense. And I don't care that its only a ""comic book"" story. That makes it okay, somehow?Bash on a multicultural basis if you're gonna do any bashing. Otherwise, what you are accomplishing - supposedly ""Liberal"" Hollywood - is being racist, sexist, ageist and succeeding in portraying the most disgusting stereotypes imaginable. I can only hope Slavic people around the world will not see this vile movie. Or, better yet, Eastern European filmmakers will start making films where every bad guy is a pasty White, American male, Anglo-Saxon Protestant with a big beer belly and a really bad haircut! One can only hope!"
699,1,"I wanted to like this movie but Black widow does not even spare or even care about other black widows. After Endgame Marvel began to stagnate or even went downhill. Disney plus shows were mediocre at best and I honestly do not know what to expect further. Most of best actors went away and who can even take their place? Anyway, they should have done this movie in phase 3 because now it is just useless. We already know Natashas ending, so why should we care? It is a dissapointment and I hope that Disney will give Marvel a chance to make better movies because this one looks as cash grab without any deeper meaning behind it."
700,8,"Enjoyable and entertaining I had zero expectations for this movie, turned out to be fun and enjoyable.Not the best MCU movie, but it delivers a good amount of laughs and light atmosphere."
701,7,"A fairly standard MCU film that stands by itself. After the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), it was difficult to perceive where a Black Widow movie would fit in the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fortunately, even though there are over 20 films in this cinematic juggernaut, there is still room to fill gaps in the overall story. Taking place after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Widow (2021) follows Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johannson) as she takes some ""personal time"" to put to bed the demons from her past. It's a little weird to have such a standalone film in the MCU, but it's the only way something like this could work.Almost a decade after the ""Budapest"" incident was first mentioned in an offhand remark in The Avengers (2012), Black Widow finally shows us the details of this significant event-even if it was played as a joke in previous films. Natasha's past was brought up in other parts of various MCU films, but this movie finally stitches them all together into a coherent narrative. Of course, while it does give some much-needed background to one of the franchise's most secretive characters, it feels a little like a moot point by now.Regardless of its relevance to the MCU as a whole, two performances stand out in my mind. David Harbour makes the film endlessly entertaining as he chews the scenery, but Florence Pugh nails it with the back-and-forth comedy between the two ""sisters."" It's no wonder that I have enjoyed her acting as of late (especially in Little Women (2019)). And while most of the MCU movies that bookend this film's chronology explain what happens afterward, it's the post-credits scene that made me roll my eyes as Disney tries to push more of their Disney+ programming into the greater MCU framework.A fairly standard MCU film that stands by itself, I give Black Widow 3.5 stars out of 5."
702,6,"Not very good I'm disappointed. Why all marvel production disappointed me this year?? The red room and all the new characters were not very good portrayed, the chasing scenes were good but they couldn't compare to those in Captain America 2. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson is gorgeously handsome."
703,5,Unexpected My expectations is just too high.Jkkhwvejobwnkwnrbr ndkememowjwbw ekodk.
704,7,"Not peak Marvel but far from a bad movie! Super hero fatigue is a real thing at this point.Not for me, but I hear some people are getting tired of these movies :D In that respect Black Widow certainly isn't a mold breaker and is not the adrenaline shot to the heart in the ways Guardians or Ragnarok were.But what it does do well is tell a surprisingly touching story of family (cue Vin Diesel) and gives us a ""little"" more context of the character of Natasha Romanoff, with an overview of the events that led to her becoming an Avenger. The choice to set this film in between Civil War and Infinity War is a bit perplexing. As most of the events teased in previous MCU outings such as her training to become an assassin and the infamous mission at Budapest (which has been the inside joke between her and Clint for over a decade!) are merely glossed over. The Budapest flashback is 2 minutes long if that. It's almost as if the Director Cate Shortland never saw an MCU film and was just told ""hey you should probably reference a couple of these things at some point or else fans will be pissed."" But if so little effort is put into the execution what's the point? Just leave them out entirely.The plot feels more like a Mission Impossible story than a marvel movie and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Black Widow agents are dispatched on various covert op missions across the globe by a man named Dreykov. Who's developed a serum which suppresses free will and allows him to commit whatever heinous crimes he needs to without it linking back to him. Yes it's as over the top and ridiculous as it sounds. After Natasha's sister Yelena receives a (conveniently ready to go) anti serum they team up to stop Dreykov with the help of their ""rent a parents"" played by David Harbour and Rachael Weiz. Ray Winstone fills the ""Russian bad guy"" archetype fine, if a little forgettable, but it's not hard in getting the audience to hate this guy. Slapping women in the face does that. The stars of the show here are David Harbour and Florence Pugh! Who electrify every scene they're in and keep the movie constantly entertaining despite the relatively low stakes of the plot compared to previous marvel outings. Harbour especially shines as a man who hides behind blind allegiance to his country but inside is just a warm 6'3 Russian teddy bear who murders people for a living. ""You girls have killed so many people"" he says as he looks down at his adoptive daughters with pride. Awww???But what in the name of Stan Lee did they do to Task Master!? I had a friend say they really ""X-men origins Deadpooled him"" and I couldn't think of a more fitting comparison. Taskmaster had the potential to be one of the best villains in the MCU if handled properly but was totally squandered here. He literally can mimic the powers of anyone he's ever seen and this is the best use of ""him"" they could think of? The twist works within the context of the story, but is truly disappointing for fans of the character. Especially since it's seems they squashed any possibility of the character returning.Let's face the facts - Black Widow has never been the most compelling Marvel character. She's played well as always by Johansson and the film does succeed in adding more weight to her sacrifice in Endgame. That post credits scene really hit. It should've been you Barton! It has some cool action, some genuinely funny moments, that don't feel as contrived as other MCU outings and it all feels grounded by some great performances. If you're not all aboard the Marvel train by this point Black Widow is not going to be the movie to change your mind. But if like myself you've been all in since 2008 then you will have a good time."
705,5,"Unfortunately lower tier MCU Don't get me wrong I really like the Black Widow character but this movie was meh for me. I'm always about the journey of the movie. If the journey the main character(or characters) go on then I'm not as interested and this was sadly the case. The action set pieces are decent but nothing that really blew me away. That's the thing about this movie for me, it's just kind of forgettable."
706,7,"Not one ""Russian"" character was believable as Russian. 2 hours of patriotic, home-grown Russians - who lived in Russia their whole lives - talking to each other in English but with painfully forced Russian accents. I'm not even Russian and I know their accents are comically off.Good to watch if you can ignore it."
707,9,"Loved it! Such a great movie! It was hilarious, loved the whole thing!"
708,3,"Yeah yeah, mark this Unhelpful and move on I have just finished watching Black Widow, and as I was watching it I was writing down everything I hated about it. So this review is going to be a bit long. This is a very divisive film. You will either like it or hate it, depending on whether you're a casual filmgoer, a film student, an MCU fan or a Marvel fan (yes, those are two different things). Since I'm a film student and a big Marvel fan, I absolutely hated this film. Black Widow is a film that MCU shouldn't have started its Phase 4 with. Seeing the future line-up this is not only looking like a black sheep, but also a cash grab.First of all let's get the praises done with. The comedic scenes are hilarious. The part where Natasha, Yelena, Alexei and Melina are sitting across the table and discussing a plan was very funny, so was when Red Guardian was telling how he is a coward and the door suddenly opens, and also when Alexei says the helicopter has enough fuel and then it suddenly falls down (although that looked a bit awkward). Secondly the actors are really great. I really like the way they act, it almost feels natural (why it doesn't really do so, I will tell later). And finally this is the only film MCU has given which doesn't have CGI. It does have VFX, but that makes sense since there's a pandemic going on and shooting in exotic locations doesn't make sense right now.With all that said, let's move on to the negative aspects. I have always hated Black Widow. She is too overpowered for a person with no superpowers. She just does cartwheels to sit on the enemy's shoulders and topples them, which really makes me wonder how weak the enemies have to be, especially considering she beats entire armies doing this. In Civil War MCU was in a moral dilemma - should they show Black Widow getting hit for once, or should they show Captain America lose? They decided to go with the third option - put Natasha on Steve's side and then let her make him win. And finally in Endgame where she had to die, she didn't even die fighting. She basically committed suicide, and in that also she beat Hawkeye up before doing so. She doesn't even have the audacity to get beaten for once even when she's dying!I would have accepted that Black Widow's superpower is that she can't take a hit, except in this film she does it a lot. And over here MCU finally does blasphemy. Read this carefully, word by word - ""They show Black Widow get beaten"". First by Taskmaster, from whom she still manages to save herself using a shield, then from Yelena whom she beats up nicely, then from Dreykov whom she beats again and then from the other widows who, well, let's get real. She can't beat them because they are girls. This is the rule of every action film, right? Speaking of the widows, there are some widows who appear in front of the camera way more than the others. This really begs the question as to why it is happening. It almost feels like they have paid the director to give them more attention.The cinematography of this film is also terrible. There is no artificial lighting because of which all the lighting on screen is coming out naturally. The only time any colour grading is used is when the flashback is shown where Natasha blows Dreykov's daughter's school. The characters are always standing in the wrong place of the screen, which ruins the whole photography look to it. Normally if you are ever shown to come on the screen, if you're facing left you should be on the right side of the screen and vice versa. Even the shots of exotic locations look like they have been taken by a middle aged mom. In the climax scene when Natasha says, ""Don't do it!"" and Yelena says, ""It was fun!"" before thrusting the stick in the propeller, her head is in the bottom half of the screen and even the green screening can be seen in the background!And that's not where the bad cinematography ends. There are multiple jump cuts in every entertaining scene. This is the reason why I won't even call this film entertaining. There are many examples that I noted down while watching the film. When Natasha's Lada explodes on the bridge, just showing the car explode takes 10 shots. The scene where their car goes in the subway is done in 9 shots. The part where Yelena gets out of the operation theatre while talking to Melina takes a whopping 18 shots! All of these scenes could have looked so cool if they were done in one shot. Also for some reason the director decided to take every indoor shot from the bottom angle, because of which there were many butt shots of Natasha, Yelena and Alexei. And here we were laughing at Batman and Robin for having three such shots.The music is also terrible. Most of the time the music is very slow in comparison to the movement which is happening on the screen. Many times it uses the same Avengers-recycled music to show the climatic scene and also the ending scene when Natasha walks towards her new plane. There is also too much talking in this film. This is a low budget film. MCU had enough budget to make multiple well choreographed scenes keeping the fans on the edge of the seat as this film was literally meant to, but instead they wasted it all on just showing everyone talking, talking and more talking. Like I said earlier, the emotions of the characters could have been felt. But because of a number of reasons like too quick jump cuts, natural lighting and wrong background score they didn't deliver the impact that they were probably supposed to.The logic of the film also doesn't make sense in many places either. In the beginning they show the childhood versions of Natasha and Yelena. Natasha's childhood version looks just like her but Yelena's doesn't. It's like they were only paying attention to her while making the scene. Dreykov can't be killed by a widow who can smell her, but Natasha won't even try moving away from him till she can't breathe him and then shoot him? Since the story is set between Civil War and Infinity War, Natasha should have looked like she is between the two ages. But she looks way older, and that's a shame considering de-aging characters was done so well in Star Wars sequel trilogy. When Natasha and Yelena steal a bike, Taskmaster suddenly stops her tank in front of them, and waits for them to start driving away before chasing them. Why didn't she just crush them when she had a chance?Speaking of the Taskmaster, when she removes her mask and is shown to be Dreykov's daughter, her head looks so fake! Her neck is too long and her head is too forward, which doesn't make the head's shape to be like it will fit in the helmet. And speaking of characters who make no sense, there's Red Guardian. In the Gulag which is in remote Siberia, everyone is speaking in English? He is constantly talking about having a rivalry with Captain America, but that part is never explained. Unless there was another Captain America meanwhile, there is no way we aren't confused. And if that happens MCU will have a lot to answer for, considering it has not spoken about a Captain America having been there since then.Black Widow is like a black sheep in the MCU (see what I did there?). The problem with this film is that it has come out way too late. It feels like it was made only as a filler, so that they can grab some quick cash on a character who has been established for over 10 years. The film only adds lore to Black Widow and then goes nowhere with it. I really hope Shang Chi doesn't turn out to be like this, because that would be a disaster for this phase. I was hoping if MCU is being carried on after Endgame, it must be introducing something very big. Spider-Man: No Way Home looks more like that thing since that is what we want. This, however, skip it for now. It doesn't have anything in it that you'd want to see."
709,7,"An enjoyable movie but an underwhelming villain and pointless CGI action I went into this movie with high expectations (possibly too high) and for 2/3 of the film I was thoroughly entertained, the chemistry between Yelena and Natasha was great to see and the plot was an interesting one! Unfortunately the third act let the film down by going all out action with lacklustre visual effects and it took away from what was built up between the main characters in the early parts of the film. The interactions between Natasha & the villain were great to see and paid homage to the power of Black Widow we have seen in early MCU films!Yelena, Melania & Red Guardian are interesting additions to the MCU and I am looking forward to seeing them appear in future projects if they are able to show up again! I though Florence Pugh was fantastic in this and it was a great passing the torch movie from Natasha to Yelena.I was laughing out loud at small moments between Yelena & Natasha and enjoyed the family dynamics set up in the movie. If they had not separated all the characters for the final action scenes I reckon this movie would have had a better overall feel for me. The action throughout the movie was great with some of the best hand to hand combat we have seen so far (Shang-Chi is out later this year which will top this movie) in the MCU.I was disappointed by the cut at the end of the movie as it felt like a bit of a plot hole for me. On the other hand, the after credit scene was the perfect closure of the story and start of a new chapter for what has been one of the best characters (Black Widow) in the MCU so far.An enjoyable movie but not one I want to watch again and again like some marvel films. For me, this is because it falls victim to the large CGI action set piece which detracts from the rest of the story. If they were not falling through the sky at the end of this film it would have been a better movie which is not something you can say often."
710,6,"Fun but flawed This movie has great performances (Florence Pugh my favourite), great cinematography/visuals and ok writing. But it has poor writing at times, the Taskmaster reveal and some terrible charecters."
711,3,"The MCU does a generic action flick. This film was years in the making from what I've heard. It suffered many delays (not to mention that they elected to release Captain Marvel before this movie. And before she got killed off in Endgame no less!), some of them even COVID-related. But the important thing is that now, it's finally here. We finally get a Black Widow movie.Was it worth the wait? No. Sadly, it isn't.That being said though, the opening was really compelling. It had an amazing opening, great introductions to our characters, and even a unqiue title sequence. It really was shaping up to be an amazing film.After that though, it goes downhill faster than a maniac driving off a cliff. After that, it just switches back to full, formulaic MCU material. The kind of material that made Thor The Dark World, Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron bland and forgettable. Tons of Jokes, characters being used as punching bags, bland characterizations, a forgettable villain, and even a generic soundtrack.Red Guardian is so much of a punching bag that he just comes across as a joke rather than a compelling character. There are so many jokes that it just outweighs the dramatic stuff, it's badly paced, Dreykov is interesting but forgettable, They butchered Taskmaster, the CGI is way more noticeable and rushed, and Lorne Balfe's soundtrack is kind of bland and generic compared to his other work.The worst part though? Natasha herself is sidelined in her own movie. To be fair though, Florence Pugh does play the best character in the movie and does an amazing job with what she's given. But sadly, it's not enough to make up for the rest.We waited. We even waited after she died in Endgame. But nope, it wasn't worth it in the end. Another opportunity wasted. 1 Star (With 2 stars added for Florence Pugh's performance and the Opening)."
712,4,"Not that good CGI and action scenes. That's about it. Normally I can get into the comic book movies, but this one simply bored me. I'm honestly curious as to how, at the time of this review, this dreadful thing has a rating of 6.8. This was over 2 hours of ""meh ""."
713,6,"Like any other spy movie What makes it better than your standard action film is that it has a bit of comedy, bit more CGI and its Marvel Branded. But then again, what other plot could we have seen with a human avenger with good fighting skills?It's deff the most average movie in the MCU But they had to introduce a new character and send Natasha off so yeah."
714,8,"Confused on the hate Honestly I thought it one was one of the better marvel movies.A lot of reviews say it didn't have heart which is what confused me the most. It did a good job of setting up the emotion and family dynamic. I felt there was more emotion and character compassion than any other marvel movie.Humor was good. Action was good. I was entertained.Some scenes fell flat sure. And the pacing did have some missteps, but overall it's just a good film Only thing I can think is people are judging it as a ""marvel"" movie instead of just a film. Meaning it didn't live up to their expectations on what they know about the character or it didn't play into the overall universe like they wanted it to. I think if you just watch it. Be present. And not think of its implications and comic source, you'll enjoy yourself."
715,2,"Funny Trainwreck! You know you're watching a post-intelligence film when almost 90% of everything you're watching is impossible, over the freaking top and filled with some cringe sentimental ""family"" quotes!Black Widow is White SHerlock Holmes !The whole power of a superheroine is extremely convenient and pure non-sense.It's so bad it's amazing."
716,6,"This film could have been different and so much better. Not the most gripping of Marvel films. Whoever chose Ray Winston for a Russian villian, one of the most cockney Cockney's, needs speaking to! Glad I didn't waste money on cinema tickets."
717,10,The best action movie. This is very important to me and I still have the best result of the our website at the best action movie.
718,10,"Outstanding movie!!! I have no words!!! It is my favourite movie ever!!! Interesting plot, amazing performances, important meanings, great humour and lovely actors!!! It is worth seeing!!!"
719,8,Quite relaxing Positives :- 1. Action scenes 2. Funny momentsNegatives :- 1. Too emotional 2. Sometimes unrealistic.
720,4,Disappointing My expectations were low before I heard it was a good movie. I sure was disappointed. There is no investment in the villain and the writing was pretty lazy.
721,5,"Black Widow A minor motion picture for Marvel, but it mostly delivers. David Harbour and Florence Pugh steal every scene they are in."
722,9,"Who have given it 10 I don't rate anything 10/10. I'd have to say this is my favourite Avengers flick, a long time coming & now was the perfect time. Could you imagine how different the tone of the film would have been before 2017. Bad arse women running around in black latex kicking ass never gets boring. Since Black Widow was mortal not like himbo Thor (with his big hammer) or DC's fish guy (who always looks likes he just walk off the set of Magic Mike) the action in BW was like a Bond movie or Mission Impossible. Don't be fooled by the low meta score, well worth it; loved it."
723,9,"It's good! Twas an good farewell to Natasha. I don't get the immense hate for this movie! I do think if this was released after Civil War it would be more well-received! Overall, Wonderful!"
724,7,"Another predictable marvel spy thriller Well, Marvel is really trying to branch off into its own different ""genres"" again. Black Widow would fall into the spy category. Ya know, those down to earth movies like all three captain americas as well as falcon and the winter soldier. It's when Marvel infuses its universe with James Bond style sets and action.If you're into those kinds of films, Black Widow should be a thrilling ride back into cinema. Personally, I find spy films to be shallow, overly complex and wayyy to serious.Not rewatchable in the slightest but the passing of the torch to Florence Pugh's Yelena and post-credit scene fills you with the same potent anticipation for future films that every marvel movie is able to conjure, no matter how bad the film is."
725,6,Mehh... It was below my expectation. This movie was a very weak movie.Her story wasn't very good. Mehh in terms of action..Florence was great.
726,6,Not bad After a few days I had to think to remember this movie Not a good sign The start was very good The rest: meh Story was not surprising and to much of the same.
727,8,"Black Widow (She just came over cartwheeling and flying through the air) when she could have walked because she was right in front of meBut it cracks me up everytime she does it... she can't walk she does unnecessary cartwheels all the timeAnyway Sherlock Holmes, er I mean black Widow in white, was boring and just a lame attempt to fill Disney+Next up from Disney: the story of the taxi driver who gave a ride to iron Man for 20 seconds."
728,5,"It's not what we expected Despite the delays and the public's expectation to see this film, it is not what was expected. To begin with, the script is bad, the second half of the film is boring, there are bad special effects and bad shots, it has many conveniences that help to develop the story in a very simple way, the direction is bad, on the other hand the performances are good and the first half is entertaining. I think it's not a good ending for the character and it doesn't measure up to other Marvel movies. For me, it falls short of my expectations and the quality of what should have been delivered to the true fans of the character."
729,6,"An Unnecessary Movie Just To Make Some Money! I was afraid that the movie gonna be really bad or nothing new gonna be introduced, and well my fear become true after watching the movie.The movie's villain was really stereotype russian villian who wants to conqer the world, and his bodyguard Taskmaster wasn't a threat to our heros despite his abilities and powers, that make the image of Natasha bigger and become like superman consedering her abilities.Well the movie wasn't that bad, the comedy was good, and the action was the best thing in the film (not to mention the some problem in teh CGI and the logic)."
730,10,"Is there any empowered female lead movie with more than a 7 star average??!! My only complaint about this movie is that it wasn't a part of a trilogy.The main criticism I've heard about this movie - besides ""eww silly girl"" *I'm an incel* blah blah blah - is that it wasn't what they expected (in other words, of course). Well... because some people's telepathy to the PROFESSIONAL writers didn't get through us that a valid reason to take their review seriously????Also, comic fans that complain about the presentation of Taskmaster, it'd be impossible to put every comic onto film just as they were written (LAST CENTURY). Not as much interest would've been paid therefore the projects would've been tanked. Cinema is different to comics and people need to accept that.Now the movie:"
731,10,I hate it so much I hate it. I will never watch it again i. Will never eve see it again. Its the most awful movie i have ever seen. I hate. I hate it i hate it.
732,6,"Just a typical movie that you would enjoy watching I was expecting for more but overall, the movie was good."
733,6,"Disappointing movie It felt like the movie is about Natasha's sister and it was kinda useless, I mean, who cares what she did after Civil war? We already know she's dead."
734,6,"Enough with the ridiculous Russian accent The characters are supposed to be Russian and yet they speak English with a forced, unrealistic accent.Cast Russian actors or let the actors speak with their natural accent.It ruined most of the scenes."
735,2,"Its just a plain old story. Soooooo boring Why? Why? Why Marvel did this? There is sooooo much potential, new stuff to show off. I mean we saw the natasha's ability, but marvel cam add even more stuff to impress the audience, hook them to the movie. Such a disappointment. The story is just awful. We saw those plot hundred times already. Just a some random bad guy tries to destroy the world and MC stops them no matter what. Its like an Apple, launching same stuff for 10 years and nothing big has changed. Movie quality is excellent, but there are some times a bit cheesy acting and CGI. Maybe Marvel wants to quickly end this madness. Who knows?!"
736,10,"People who watched the whole Avengers series will enjoy the movie This movie is INCREDIBLE! It contents of comedian parts besides thrilling. I've enjoyed every minute of it. I was crying and feel happy at the same time, even I couldn't sleep for 3 days cuz of thinking about it. I'm surprised and unsatisfied about the rate I mean it certainly deserves more. I hate people who watch it as an action movie without watching the whole series and give their low rate 😟. At last, I've to say that Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh were stunning, heart-taking and I can't get over their beauty and the waiting for about two years was extremely worth it."
737,4,Missed opertunity Would of been a lot cooler if they took the chance to tell her backstory from a younger point of view like how she was trained by the bad guys and how she got out. Instead we got a mediocre good guys take down bad guys.
738,4,"If you like CGI and fast action... Just another non stop action movie with a lot of CGI effects in a superhero environment. And don't get me wrong some superhero movies I really liked but this one is all about the action. The character development is poor, all figures are kinda bland and the villain is your typical guy but this time surrounded by women fighters.I made it till the end but a forgettable movie that takes itself too seriously and hence won't make my collection of hero movies."
739,7,"Solid Black Widow can be described with only one word as the title suggest: solid. It's not the greatest thing that Marvel has made, it hasn't a big scope or a cerebral plot that tries to impress. No, Black Widow is a solid movie that entertains for all its duration and it perfectly fine this way. I liked it and I am looking forward to rewatch it in the future."
740,5,"Black Widow deserved better This movie could not accept what it should be, a spy film. Just a spy film would have been enough, but it also had to Marvel movie. And when these two things collide experience becomes more and more irritating with each passing minute, because the movie can not commit to neither one of these things."
741,8,"Bad but gooood I have been watinh for this movie for so long so of course I was disappointed but because it is black widows own movie everyone has to love it! So i love it! The opening credits was the best part if the whole movie! It was so good. Everyone says taskmaster was disappointing but she wasn't the villain, Draykov was. And I think every woman can say that he's scary. He literally traffics little girls."
742,9,"I loved it Great movie, there are things that could have been better but overall I loved it! The character deserves a whole trilogy. Great casting. Super relevant topics. We need more female super heroes movies. Definitely a moving experience for a girl. Maybe it could have been bette rod a woman had written it. I'm obsessed."
743,5,"Luke-warm writing This was an opportunity to really dig into just how brutal life as an assassin could be. Only 1 in 20 pass the program, and for the DnD players, that's a natural 20 every time. Should mean no explicitly whiny scenes and preferably none that could be interpreted as such.I guess that's the conundrum the writers face - how could someone so brutal really fit in with the Avengers? So everything gets watered down. Show a string of assassinations? Nah, let's just montage targets. Show a truly brilliant assassination? Nah, let's show her hit a button and display regret.Then the lazy exposition/hand-waving on what could have been better scenes. Like when she taunts the guy who's surrounding her building, then we cut to her escape disguise/tactic - flaunting the iconic red hair in the open. Are we to just assume she's ""that good""? This is her movie. We should see her actually being that good.Then all that luke-warm writing trickles down into all the character interactions. Can't have another Widow be more intense, so they're mostly all just sort of, there. Mentor character? Looks like he's waiting for permission to speak half the time. Bad guy? How about someone just sort of haphazardly programmed, but also with an unexplained cyborg side so we can have the face reveal later in the movie."
744,3,"It doesn't have a sense of unity. The beginning of the movie was good but the middle and last half turned boring. It was cool action but honestly, I couldn't understand the story."
745,4,"only mcu film i'll never watch again There was so much hype leading up to the release of this film, yet as I was watching it I just wanted to turn it off. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh did a great job in portraying Natasha and Yelena, it was really great to be able to watch them grow up, and see some of the conditions they were put under. However, there really wasn't a decent plot, dare I say a plot at all. I never really understood exactly what the point of the film was except for show a bunch of predictable and lazy so called action scenes that didn't really show the full capabilities of any of the main characters including the parents. If you must watch it, don't expect much excitement. The only good part of this movie was seeing Scar Jo and Florence together in one film."
746,9,"MEET I LIKED THE SIDEKICK SISTER MORE Okay so I did like this mostly I did cry when I watched it but I can relate to the sister. Yelena just is more of a cool thing we learn about her, when they say Its HER story ITS YELENAS ALSO HER VEST."
747,3,"Yep, Russians talk fullnames all the time (no we don't) Reminds me that fith element scene where Korban asks Leeloo for a sorter name ;)That just makes me laugh so hard - all Russians here are so evil, that they talk with each other using fullnames.If you don't get it: saying Alexei in Russian every time is like saying Timothy or Robert instead of Tim and Bob. Which makes it terribly official (non family/close relative kinda style)Common guys, you should have talked with Russian speaking consultant, right?Regarding the movie... Nah.. basic, nothing new."
748,8,"quite entertaining Black Widow is a popular movie in my country because people already falling in love with Marvel's Endgame, of Black Widow sacrifices. Before and once the movie is released, there are so many reviews about it. What I can say about is that; this is of course a good Marvel movie to show up deeper about the background of Black Widow, that is sadly enough to be known, and yet she is not the only one by tribe. She has ""sisters in the same destiny"" and how this movie is coming up the main story that Black Widow community is wrong, is quite entertaining. This movie perhaps is not good as the comic book, but please appreciate the art in film making, that is not always perfectly like the book. Also I notice the new comer Florence Pugh who is good enough to stand along with Scarlett Johannson. So welcome to Marvel for all young avengers, including Hailee Steinfeld for next Hawkeye series coming up in November 24 in Disney Plus App."
749,6,"Who is the Black Widow? Expected a Wonder Woman, we got a Black Widow. I felt like there was too much of unnecessary family drama added. Most of the film felt like a very normal family reunion comedy drama. Action sequences were also average. May be I need more comics education to completely understand the film, and the plot."
750,6,"Started strong, fell apart on the way Even tho I'm a hardcore MCU fan since I was 8, this is one of the movies that didn't live up to the expectations. The movie was supposed the bring a closure to Natasha Romanoff's character as black widow! Even tho the first half of the movie was strong it didn't keep it that way till the end. It should have been better. They wasted such a great villain (those who read the comics may know). The character of Dreykov was plain and boring. Atleast after doing all this he could have been interesting. Don't get me wrong I didn't wanted a all powerful supervillain, I just wanted a better villain just like zemo. Rest of the movie was great Florence Pugh's Yelena was on the Spot! David harbour also did a great job playing the Red Guardian. The movie wasn't bad but could have been better."
751,6,"Enjoyable brainless flick The best parts of the movie were when they all do something together as a family. Melina (Rachel Weisz) and Alexei (David Harbour) were the best characters in this movie followed by Yelena (Florence Pugh). The Villan and evil arc were extremely badly written and I have already forgotten about them by next day.Natasha by herself is the same old boring black widow from some other MCU. It was not amazing, but again it is not terrible either. I agree with what Redletter media has said about this title."
752,3,"Too much unnecessary CGI Yeah this was too much for me, the CGI was too much I couldn't wait for the film to end. I was even sleepy but I had to watch it since I was at a cinema and had obviously paid. It's not worth watching honestly, you are not missing anything by not watching it."
753,10,"Exciting and engaging I was really excited for another marvel movie focused on a female Avenger. It was exciting and at times emotional. Scarlet is an awesome, strong lead and I love the addition of her sister.Well worth paying for this film and well worth supporting a film with a great female lead."
754,8,"While in theory widows can be black, blue, white, red, yellow or . . . . . . chartreuse, in practice they must share a mandatory prerequisite: A dead spouse. However, BLACK WIDOW provides no evidence that title character Natasha (or the thousands of others in her allegedly grieving sisterhood) EVER enjoyed a single instant of wedded bliss. In fact, the younger sibling in Nat's ad hock household makes it a point to itemize how she was surgically stripped of the components necessary to become a bride during her training to attain her bogus widowhood status. In American, words have meanings. However, this film documents the fact that the Russian language consists of duplicity, prevarication and lies. So if you're tempted to slop ""Russian dressing"" onto your salad, better think twice!"
755,6,"MCU or MEH? We've reached the point where MCU movies can have great casts, solid direction, and truly hilarious moments...but still be just okay. Entertaining? Yes. Effective storytelling? Only sometimes. I had to pause a couple different times just to explain to family members when and why this movie was happening. That's not a good sign. The big reveals fell flat, the plot holes were huge, and the explanations took way too long. I still enjoyed watching the cast kick ass, but that is not enough. I miss the early movies when you didn't need internet research to understand why you should care (and when the endings were not quite as ridiculous)."
756,2,I wanted to get out of the movie theater This movie put my expectations in a shredder with a lot of boredom and predictability. I was so bored that I wanted to sleep (never happens to me). This was really disappointing.
757,4,"So much potential and yet... This movie is a veritable treasure trove of unattained potential. There are so many interesting themes that could have been explored more in depth which was left either completely untouched or completely unexplored. The fantastical action sequences showcasing a large budget can only do so much to make the movie enjoyable.So what is this movie exactly? I personally was hoping to see an action spy thriller with a character with a very interesting background and while it fits that criteria it comes out lacking substance. In my opinion this is because the writers attempt to explore too many themes without developing the characters. Even the titular character seem to be given no real development. The other characters central to the story remain largely undeveloped and one dimensional as well. Which is a shame because these charactes seem at first glance very interesting. Her Soviet super soldier father, her genius scientist mother, her kickass cynical assassin sister, the leader of a shadow organization and a mysterious assassin seemingly capable of replicating the powers of others. Yet for all that we spend an exorbitant amount of time on the theme of family which only really appeals to one character and even then barely. One character is reduced into ridicule and is despite of this given a massive amount of screentime which could have been given to more compelling characters whose motivations remain a complete mystery. So the family theme is given much dedication, but the characters make that theme uncompelling. There is perhaps a more interesting theme of sisterhood in the story, yet this is instead given far too little screentime to become truly compelling.For a spy thriller the villains objectives and motivations are completely untouched. What is their purpose, their reason for being? What have they been doing all this time? Beyond their recruitment and training methods we know essentially nothing. We are told it is capable of exercising enourmous power capable of starting and ending wars at a whim. Yet no examples are given for this and once this shadow organization is vanquished seemingly nothing happens. The other villain possess an almost completely neglected connection to the main character even though it could be very compelling.What you will get is fast cut action scenes, lavish CGI and an introduction to a new recurring marvel character so if that is what you were hoping for then you won't be dissappointed, but if you like me were excited for a spy thriller with substance featuring Black Widow. Well then you'll not be well pleased."
758,7,"Bit of a mess, still enjoyable Probably the biggest issue with Black Widow is the fact that it is clearly forced to become part of the Avengers franchise. The amount of plot details derived from this effort just crams up especially throughout the first half of the runtime, making it near impossible to keep up with the already complicated plot. Moreover, the main concept of the movie being really solid and grounded, it feels like the whole sci fi marvel tone just didn't fit in. Had the protagonist a different name, and the filmmakers not the need to satisfy the franchise needs, the movie would instantly become a near-masterpiece. And here's why.The technical aspect of the film is excellent (precisely what one should expect from a 200 million production). The cinematography is spicy yet coherent, doing an excellent job at creating both the suitable atmosphere and a brilliant looking piece of video. The visual effects well stand up to a modern big-budget action movie, with well-executed set extensions and proper simulations.As for the plot, the idea of bringing the aftermath of the cold war to the present day is meticulously interwoven with the topic of family, the latter definitely better executed than the average budget-driven cinematic disaster of our times. The characters feature well-written and distinct personalities, and for the most part decent arcs as well. The acting does no bad job of helping out in this area.To mention some barely significant downsides, the directing does fall behind at particular action sequences, where it gets hard to even tell the two opponents apart. Moreover, despite the plot being well-structured, there flow of information is not, resulting in the first half of the movie sounding more like an online lecture and the second half being pure chaos.Finally, we all know killing a protagonist off in-between installments is not a good thing, but killing them off in the final credits, that's a whole new level of a weird choice. Anyway, a ticket to the sequel would probably be a good buy for me."
759,2,Disappointment after waiting years. I highly recommend not to watch this movie. Taskmaster character was a joke. What do the executives do when the writers come with this kind of garbage story.It doesn't matter if the VFX and action sequences are great if the story is pure trash.
760,3,"Wokewood strikes again.. I was certain that Captain Marvel was gonna be the worst movie in the series cause it couldn't possibly get any worse than that, but sure enough..Don't let the title of this movie fool you, cause Black Widow is not only a side-character, but also a caricature of her former self all done for the express purpose of pushing ""Yelena"" into the spotlight for future films..There is absolutely nothing in this movie that stands out or that deserves any praise, the acting was atrocious par SJ, the writing is filled with plotholes and conveniences and the hilariously bad accents were very distracting...and least I forget, Taskmaster...had any other movie done the opposite there would be absolute outrage, but in this case, who cares, double standards amirite..They could have done this SO MUCH better, but no, it's just a shallow money grab propped up on the Avengers movies fame, what an absolute waste."
761,7,"Natasha Romanoff, aka ""The Black Widow"", finally gets to tell her story I was expecting a typical, CGI-infused Avenger movie, and it certainly is that. Black Widow, though, has a lot in common with James Bond movies. There's even a scene in which 007 is playing on TV. The Black Widow must stop a Russian General called Dreykov, a sort of SPECTRE czar megalomaniac who ""rescues"" unwanted girls and turns them into super assassins, called widows. Widows go through extensive training. A select few get chosen. The rest are killed. This makes Dreykov a monstrous misogynist, in a movie, directed by a woman, Cate Shortland, which has unmistakable feminist themes. There are two main Black Widows: Scarlett Johansson's character, and Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh. Belova is impulsive where Romanoff is introspective. The two are sisters only in that they grew up as part of a Russian cell, in an Ohio suburb, along with Rachel Weisz as their brilliant scientist mother, and David Harbour, as Red Guardian, Russia's version of Captain America, as the dad.The action set pieces, and fight scenes were good, but no better or worse than your typical Marvel Avenger movie. There are the standard wisecracks, as Johansson and Pugh riff on each other. Yelena teases Natasha's signature landing move, with one arm extended behind, the other hand on the floor, and legs spread apart, a fighting stance Yelena finds diva-like and pretentious, and is disgusted with herself when performing the same pose. The chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh is nimble and enjoyable. The scenes with David Harbour, arm wrestling people in a gulag prison, are also very funny. In summary, this is a solid, fun Marvel movie, with a hint we will be seeing more of Black Widow Yelena Belova."
762,6,"Okay But A Bit Boring I watched this after finishing Falcon and Winter Soldier. Wow, did Marvel going down now? They are equally boring.Okay, some good thing about this movie. Alexei and Yelena are the true star of this movie. Their performance are great. Background music is good. Visually entertaining. Decent plot. But the main star is nowhere to find. The Black Widow is underperformed.Actually they have good plot showing her background. A bit twist in the end about the main enemy's daughter. But they don't show it deep enough to make us connected to Black Widow.But, this is good enough to watch and spend your night with your friend or family. Maybe because Avenger has set the bar so high, other superhero movie feels boring right now."
763,4,Don't watch its really bad I was not impressed at all. I suggest you do not see.
764,3,"Awful ... Disappointed Can't expect this from a Marvel movie. Bad story line, bad acting, bad CGI.Movie seems ok in first half but second half totally waste."
765,5,"I left half way through the movie I was excited to watch this movie based on the teasers and trailers. However, I was extremely disappointed with the weak plot and endless girl drama that was the focus of the story.I kept giving it a chance that it will pick up while I was watching but couldn't wait any longer after around 90 minutes have passed.Could've been way better!"
766,3,Meh. I think this movie garnered more attention because of the lawsuit but I watched it and it was OK but nothing great. I found myself bored more times than not.
767,6,"not great, not terrible Don't expect too much from this movie. Very skippable movie It has its moments during the first half of the movie. The final act I do feel the movie kinda falls apart. Way too much CGI and lets forget something like physics exist. The stakes are also not that high since you know, Natasha will make it through this whole ordeal because of Endgame. Yelena is a nice addition to the MCU so I am looking forward to seeing more of her."
768,6,"It's only for MCU fans! Feels it is made for only for MCU, people who have not seen the previous marvel movies might feel boring."
769,5,Could have been better My first MCU movie which got so low rating for a reason Scarlett lost its charm in the movie while florence make a dent Overall story direction are average & not upto the mark as MCU generally have.Disappointed with Romanoff might be last marvel movie.
770,4,"Doesn't feel like a marvel movie Not sure why but it lacks the marvel touch, quite possibly the worse super heroe movie, definitely marvels worst."
771,9,"Brilliant I went into this movie with pretty low expectations, but ended up loving it! As many others mention, the character of Yelena is one of the best parts. Alexei is also a really fun character. It's a really rich story filled with great characters, great acting and great action."
772,6,Pugh...<3 I talked in a Russian accent for an hour after watching.Oh and the movie was aight.
773,9,"Loved IT! The establishing scene (before the opening logos) is (IMHO) amazing! So, before the logos I had already thought to myself ""I'm gonna love this movie"". I enjoy more grounded Marvel films (that feel like they are set in the real world). For me the question that drew me into Marvel films was ""what do comic book superheroes look like in real life"" so I love the more earth based, limited superheroes (that if you squint they could be real) and fights that involve guns and cars blowing up (not vague space things). The action was satisfying, and gave me ""old school action movie"" vibes. The ""heart "" of the film (it's characters and relationships) was it's greatest strength. It's deadpan, cold humour was also great. Although in one sense new characters stole the show, the way there stories and Romanoff's were grown together made it a fitting send off for her (and gave us new supers to root for).Just to help you out my top Marvel films ranking goes 1. Black Panther 2. GOTG 3, Black Widow 4. Avengers (1) 5. Winter Soldier."
774,4,Trying to be funny but not working Don't expect to much. Trailer is the only good thing about it.
775,1,"Awful and nonsensical with a pinch of obvious misandry. If that's what phase 4 has to offer, I'm truly, genuinely done with marvel. So much nonsense and clutter.But hey! We scored some cultural points because director is a woman! And her greatest work is... uh... hmm.. SHE'S A WOMAN! SUCCESS!Could we, P-L-E-A-S-E hire directors and screenwriters by their competency and skill, rather than their reproductive organs?"
776,8,"Well that was fun! Doesn't always make 100% sense with the rules of physics and such like, but what the hell! Struggled to fall asleep in this one 👍"
777,2,"Horribly dull and boring Not much to say. Boring plot, useless in the MCU, boring dialogues, boring characters, zero tension because it's a prequel.Skip it, you'll save 2h15 of your life."
778,7,"has it flows So finally movies are back in the cinema and this one was one of the first to watch. An Avengers spin-off.It's nice to see how Black Widow was created but after a while it became a bit too much of blah blah but towards the end it do picks up the action again.The effects are stunning and the fight scene's are spectacular too but as said, the story itself has it flows. And maybe some reviews are true, it's more about her sister to be honest.Still a decent Marvel flick but not the best one.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5."
779,8,"Excellent, and different, Avengers/marvel movie I'm not sure about all the hate this movie is getting here in the reviews. Me and my wife both loved it! A more reflective, deeper marvel movie, with a fantastic cast, story, dialogue and excellent action. Just don't go in expecting another Jon Favreau bonanza (although I love his style too, but for different reasons) and you'll have a great time :)"
780,5,"Well.. In marvel films Black Widow always seemed like a underdeveloped character for me. Quite boring I might say; yes, she's a spying badass assassin, but although rightfully so, overshadowed by Thunder Gods, angry green dudes and what not. It never seemed like she had a platform as a character in this messy circus. Until this was announced.. and oh boy they did not deliver.First of all - character played by miss Pugh is far more interesting than all the baggage we got for Romanoff over the years, and this was the time to deliver on her part; unfortunately they did more of the same.Second - the story. What is this the 90's? Generic antagonist - I am this and that cause I am evil. Pointless, stupid, intern level writing.""I will take over the world with all these women soldiers!"" Why?Third. I know this is a marvel film, but there is no real quintessential character development at all./ ** Sorta spoiler here Yes, there are sentimental moments of fake families reunite and children being abused for their exceptional predisposition to combat skills or whatever.**/ Only thing we get is supporting actress miss Pugh having moments ... lets just say moments, that lead to absolutely nothing story wise.Fourth. Visuals were great. Combat was pretty good."
781,10,"Incredible Movie!!! You guys are just sexist lmao The movie was way above my expectations! For those saying that it pushes an agenda, it by no means does so. It's literally just a superhero movie with female leads and people are unexpectedly pissed about it. Florence Pugh is absolutely stellar and I'm so excited to see her in this role! This movie also makes Natasha WAY more likable as a character as well!! Definitely would recommend and even see again in theaters!"
782,1,Utter garbage Absolutely disgusting garbage movie with no plot.Just some CGI and then occasionally a new character shows up with a stupid line.This movie is an utter disgrace and an example of Disney money making machine destroying the legacy of a legendary Marvel character - Black Widow.
783,4,Super extra exaggerated action scenes I really don't understand the latest tendency to ruin potentially great films with action scenes that are so exaggerated that just don't feel right as they are so unreal... It's like they are doing what was done to 007 for many years... Didn't they learned with the mistakes of the past? Marvel studios did great films but this and Aquaman are just mediocre...
784,8,"Not as bad as they would have you believe I think the one thing that I've learned is not to take too seriously other peoples views on movies. For a start if I'm watching an MCU movie I'm going to expect CGI, fight scenes and people doing stuff that we mere mortals can't do. If I wanted a serious true life story I wouldn't be watching this but if you want a fun couple of hours where belief can be suspended for a while and my expectations are for explosions, people getting bashed, and a few funny lines along the way then this is for you. Okay it's not Hamlet but we learnt a bit more about Natasha and I can see her 'sister' becoming an Avenger in later movies and I think she would do a good job. Don't think about it too deeply. Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is."
785,8,"Russian Ultra The most action-packed Marvel film I've seen in a while! If they're not running away, being chased or fighting each other, Black Widow and her family are fighting the big bad Red Room recruits! Lots of details about the making of a licenced-to-kill Widow, seem very Mk Ultra-ish. The brain-washing, sensory deprivation and lethal training sounded familiar- from every Spy and WWII film ever made- yet Marvel seem to give it a glossy new spin. But, instead of answering questions of Black Widow's past, it seemed to raise quite a number more! It even alluded to what happened in Budapest with Clint, but did not do any much-wanted backflashes! Amazing performances all round, surprising David Harbour comedy and Pugh's athleticism deserve a mention, along with Olga (Bond-girl) purposeful loss of face! End credit opens a hole into the next Phase for the Avengers, and the film firmly states that there is not just one Black Widow out there! A worthy addition to the Marvelous world of Superheroes!"
786,7,"A pleasant surprise. Usually when they do stand alones for smaller characters they tend to flop but this was really enjoyable. I know nothing of Black Widow's origins so I was really drawn into how she came to be. The action was great and rather raw for MCU but awesome. The story was well done and the characters were all strong. The movie transitioned well into what the future had in store for the franchise and it all worked. The best was Yelena (Florence Pugh), she was a great addition to the MCU and very funny. Pugh is a fantastic actress and a total babe, I'm glad they gave her the role as well as Red Guardian (David Harbour) who is always a great watch. I would rate this better than Captain Marvel but not as good as Iron-Man.7.5/10."
787,8,"A great film that offers more beyond the franchise! (NO SPOILERS) There have been some mixed reviews about this flick. And after watching it, I understand why. It basically boils down to... how much do you understand about the comic book genre and black widows journey in these comic books (or acceptable journeys) ?!My review: Plain and simple. It's bloody good! It really fits into the MCU. And has a great story that will fit well into the future. More on this later...But overall: It's a great flick that has it all. Action. Drama. Story. Emotion. And really good acting and directing/ CGI! No noticeable flaws. It's a good flick! FULL STOP!So to dissect the movie further... This movie delves into Natasha Romanoff a little further. Shows us a glimpse of her background, family ties etc. And what drives her ... and then years later what brings her backgrounds together, if at all!There is a good story line about her sister here. And I'm glad they did... It's a great opportunity for future movies (I hope) about her story. She's a great strong character as well.But the best thing about this movie (besides aligning the facts with the avengers storyline) is the emotional aspect of Natasha, and what drives her to do what she does. Where she comes from?! And why she pursues to do what she does. This ties well with the endgame movie and her choices then! (Hint!) ""The burst of new found emotions"".This movie is a great watch, and it will make double more sense to those who have followed what has happened in Avengers End Game.In a nutshell. If you watched endgame. You have to watch this! Her decisions will make more sense!"
788,6,"Not great, not terrible Not an equal film to other ""Avengers"" movies. Slow plot, nothing new, but still watchable. You ll see exactly what you expect, nothing more, nothing less. No reason for this movie to be made. Action begins in the last 20 min."
789,10,I'm surprised about that movie It's massive achievement for that movie to come with that skills of assassination the thing is jon wick was just the same but in women act are we talking about.scarlett johansson the dream girl it's certainly better than Gal Gadot .Scarlett johansson for sure she broke every move she made in that movie to one hell of work the valance was epic the fight was magnificent MY IDEA scarlett johansson vs Keanu Reeves ohohhhhh man that i would like to see on big screen the pretty and the dankness beast it's horror movie but as i say no wish can come true this my second review on this site and it will be the last 2 best assassins in the world god pls it's wish i won't happen waw scarlett johansson the soul to my heart.
790,7,"Marvel's movie return is just alright. Now this movie isn't bad, it's just not that good as other marvel films. Honestly this movie disappointed me a whole lot. Most of this movie is just dialogue, as if Quentin Tarantino directed it. The action is very good and the graphics are great, but overall it's just alright."
791,1,"Poor Marvel film... Its just a CGI film... We get zero to none information about Black Widow's training... How she become the black widow, what she stand for... All i saw was just a superhuman Black widow getting out of fights with zero damages... And falling from the 5th floor unharmed... You can do way better films Marvel/Disney... I think this movie needs re-writing...."
792,10,"Well crafted Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Starts at great pace, the action scenes are superb and the depth of the storytelling takes it away from just being a superhero story. Great casting & worth the wait to watch."
793,4,"Generic waste of time For me this movie is as generic as it can be. It's something i watched a lot. Same cliche, very weak jokes, weak action or action that i've seen million times. What sane person would like car chases in 2021. This is so 2010x... A bit drama nobody cares about.To sum up my rating is meh (5/10).And I wouldn't recommend this to moviegoers. Maybe for children that didn't see many movies."
794,5,"Black Widow Review Coming out of COVID 19 lockdown, Black Widow is the first film under Marvels Phase 4. With fan expectations at a high after the Infinity War saga completing, and the only phase 1 avenger to not have their own dedicated movie, all eyes are on the Black Widow Movie to close the Black Widow story from the avengers.Thoughts: This film really drives this idea of family for Black Widow that is extremely out of character when compared to the previous phases. Another review compared Black Widow being a side kick in her own movie. Its hard not to agree with that. As someone who has never read the comics, this still feels bad. It feels like Marvel setting up her sister Yelena for Phase 4 rather than closing the Black Widow Saga.The film is brought up by the introduction of Alexei and Melina played by David Harbour & Rachel Weisz respectively. This Cold War era spy family provides comic relief through out the movie with their ""every day"" family issues.One word to describe movie: Forced.Closing statement: It would be easy to blame the poor script on Disney if it wasn't for Scarlett Johansson producing & hand picking the Director for Black Widow. If your on the fence about buying a ticket (or Disney primer access) I'd recommend holding off until its available on normal Disney+."
795,7,Long await was it worth it......? I have been excited for black widow and when seeing it I was happy with it but there's one bit that I don't like. (SPOILERS) the reveal of task master being the daughter of the master of the red room was a good idea but I didn't like the ending of task master task master was a badass looking villains but how it ended wasn't it getting that red smashed into its face then it becoming good should of not been how it should of ended for taskmaster task master is and ongoing villain for black widow and the avengers and should of not been turned to good. But the rest of the movie was fun and enjoyable.
796,8,"A great escapist entertainment This MCU movie works for me, surprisingly better than my average expectations, because it knows exactly what it is: a piece of escapism well excecuted, with little tons of darker themes never fully explored and tons of funny stuff and thrilling set pieces. Scarlett Johansson is great as always (though I loved her much better in Infinity Way and her emotional send off in Endgame), but the real MVP here is Florence Pugh. This woman is amazing! A strong Marvel addition to me, I liked much better than I expected after reading some reviews.PS: Malia J ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" cover is one of the best things of this movie."
797,6,"Not bad, but not what I expected I would have expected more on her childhood training and her start at secret Russian agent.Other than that it was not bad, not excellent neither but certainly not bad."
798,8,Slightly underwhelming Loved the message portrayed and the action was amazing but the plot could've been better. Loved Flo and Scarlett as sisters !!
799,2,"Al men are...well.....you know. It seems that Hollywood can no longer make a film without portraying all men as losers, idiots, cowards, bullies etc. Etc. Only women are pure and good and noble and........well.....you know.This one is certainly no exception."
800,8,"Pleasantly surprised I went into this movie expecting to be bored and uninterested as Black Widow has historically been a misused character. However, I was so interested throughout this movie and am thrilled that Black Widow got an amazing send off."
801,1,So disappointed I really expected more of the movie. This was the worst mother movie I ever saw..
802,4,"Boring Over hyped PR... film was very lack luster, was expecting a lot more, especially with young jovovich breakout role."
803,4,Disappointed. I was expecting more from marvel.I was hoping to see a great movie to farewell an actor that has done great things within the MCU.Unfortunately Marvel in my opinion used her fanbase by producing a movie that was nothing more than a vehicle to introduce more phase 4 content and actors and less about Black Widow.With no super powers I was hoping to see some great spy story to rival James Bond. This was not the case.Very one dimensional story.The action was great but anyone can do that.We expect more from the greatest female spy in the MCU.It didn't do her story justice.It just introduced her replacement and set up more drama for phase 4 in the post credits scene.And that's about it.
804,9,"Brilliant, must-watch Marvel thriller This fantastic film has a spectacular balance of the inevitable darkness of Natasha's history, comedy, and action. It is one of my favourite Marvel movies and I don't understand how it has such low ratings."
805,10,"Super Entertaining - Great film Honestly, i'd give this film 8 stars, but the ten is to balance out the misogynists giving it 1-3 star reviews. The movie is great. It's funny, it's got action, introduces new characters, etc. I wish there had been more insight into Natasha's childhood in the Red Room, but honestly that's my only complaint.!Spoiler Warning!The people saying Taskmaster was a ""terrible villain"" or ""too political"" are, frankly, idiots. If you watched the movie, you'd understand that Taskmaster isn't the villain, Dreykov is. Taskmaster was another one of the girls he exploited for his own personal gain. And Taskmaster being a woman is not political. How would it be political?? It's not."
806,10,"Will definitely rewatch over and over again Yup. She deserves the role. Can't really imagine any other actress playing the role. Scarlett Johansson IS Black Widow herself from the attitude, passion, and greatness."
807,1,Your body odor controls the women That's it.... The entire movie was able how one man controls the world with his body odor. That the limit of their imagination..... what a letdown.
808,9,"American Super Pie It has the American Pie song so a 9 just for that... I also fell in love with Yelena (just make her the female Deadpool), i wanna see Red Guardian fight Captain America while telling stories of his father and i wanna see Olga be more Taskmastery in more movies without the mind control of her father and without the mask.As for Black Widow well... i always loved her so no changes here. Sad that there will be no more of her. I'll miss her.But seriously... a 9 for American Pie..."
809,8,I liked this movie! Good action and good story...not perfect but enjoyable to me!! Hope you like it too!!!😎
810,6,"Kinda disappointing It is a movie worth watching but it isn't as entertaining and intriguing as a lot of other Marvel movies. We have waited so long for a black widow movie and when it is finally here, I can't help but to feel a little bit disappointed. Tough the action wasn't very good the classic marvel comedy held up to its high standards. It is in fact a very funny movie and the dialogue between Natasha and her family is often hilarious.Overall this movie is pretty mediocre and it kind of felt like the whole thing was just filler."
811,1,"Cuba bad, communism bad America number 1 yeay lets go capitalism Lets make a movie about what USA does, did, will do, and sell it as the communists are doing it."
812,7,"""It Was Real To Me Too"" More than a decade after her debut, Marvel's first female Avenger finally receives a solo outing.It's hard to say the wait was worth the experience (though seeing a Marvel film on the big screen for the first time in nearly two years could arguably fit that description) because as good as ""Black Widow"" is - and it's really good - it almost feels too little, too late for one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most endearing characters and the woman who brought her to life, Scarlett Johannson.As fans remember (don't read past this point if you haven't seen ""Avengers Endgame"") Romanoff met her end on Vormir as the required sacrifice to obtain the Soul Stone to complete the Infinity Gauntlet needed to reverse Thanos' attack. ""Black Widow"" sidesteps the fact that her character is currently dead in the main continuity by serving as a prequel movie that takes place after the events of ""Captain America Civil War,"" which saw Romanoff and many of her fellow Avengers go on the run after refusing to sign the Sokovia Accords, and ""Avengers Infinity War."" The movie takes place immediately following the events of ""Civil War,"" with Romanoff setting up a new, quiet life for herself until she receives a strange message from her sister, Florence Pugh's Yelena.Black Widow's past has only been hinted at in the franchise up to this point. Everyone knows she was a former Russian operative working for the Red Room, a secretive group of highly trained assassins, but nothing beyond that has ever been revealed - until now. The movie opens with an almost surreal picturesque family life of 1980s Ohio with young Natasha and her sister playing in their backyard before dinner. David Harbour makes an appearance as the loving father before receiving a phone call that reveals this family is nothing more than a Russian plant. Think FX's brilliant ""The Americans"" show. Romanoff's picturesque family life was never real. They were never a real family, but were instead put together for the mission. Natasha and Yelena were never sisters and Harbour's Alexei was never their father.For the vast majority of the film, the script keeps the stakes relatively limited. At its core, ""Black Widow"" is a movie about family and accepting the people around you as your family. The story beats emphasize this, as Romanoff reconnects with Yelena and then Alexei on a mission to free the remaining members of the Red Room, who are now brainwashed. Romanoff is in conflict with herself about the nature of her relationships to these people as she is with the enemies that are trying to kill her. It's only when accepting that Alexei and Yelena are her family bound by something more important than blood - just as she was bound to the Avengers - that she is able to overcome her challenges.And then the movie devolves into a CG-filled final act that features the trademark Marvel Studios quota for explosions and weightless action. For the last 30 minutes, ""Black Widow"" forgets all of the soul searching its characters have done and all of the revelations they have uncovered to throw them into a meat grinder of non-stop action. It's well directed action, but it feels like a tonal shift from all that's come before.""Black Widow"" at least tries to offer something slightly deeper than the standard Marvel fare. The opening credits are downright haunting with images of the girls of the Red Room being abducted and subjugated to abuse and torture. As much as the movie is about family, it's also about how society treats women as things before casting them aside when they're no longer useful. But as is the problem with many films of this type, the imagery is there, but more so as window dressing to serve the narrative, than as a political statement.The relationships at the core of the film are better developed than perhaps any other individual movie. Johansson and Pugh have amazing chemistry, and the latter absolutely steals the spotlight - perhaps setting herself up as the Black Widow successor in the upcoming franchise. Even Harbour's failure of a Soviet super soldier is entertaining to watch, as he's constantly trying to compare himself to Captain America, Steve Rogers.""Black Widow"" is the solo film that Romanoff deserved, but it just feels as if it's fulfilling a long overdue obligation, rather than as a true entry in the MCU. Certain story beats hit a little harder knowing Romanoff's ultimate fate, and its overall theme of identity and discovering self worth fits in with the current slate of Disney+ MCU shows, but it still feels like this movie would have been much better suited to release before the ""Avengers"" duology."
813,4,"Action Movies Turning Into Video Games It started with way too much drama and turned into a video game. Kill the man, and the next labyrinth, kill the man and the next level, an armour upgrade etc... Blonde girl was under a bit spotlight that is because obviously that they will make a follow up movie. It doesn't worth of your 2 hours really."
814,4,$30.00 for premier access!?! All I can say is I recommend NEVER EVER pay 30 dollars for this. CGI was fairly decent HOWEVER the titular character sucked. Wasn't even a story about the main character-all the other characters carried the main character and thus was really about them not nat.
815,6,Good to pass time but not a great movie An average action movie. A below average MCU movie.
816,3,A disappointing waste of opportunity Remember when marvel movies used to be good? I reckon they squandered the best opportunity for a good post soviet spy flick where we got to see Natasha's journey from a child to an avenger.The writers of this one can buzz off.
817,1,Worst MCU so far I don't get how you can get money to make such a bad movie with such little talent at written a story. Who gives money to these people ?
818,4,"Yelena stealed the show Well i love Scarlet Johnson she was great no doubt in that, But the name of the movie should be black widow's sister, Yelena easily stealed the show for herself. I didn't expect that i wanted a great movie just about Natasha, i needed better acion scenes, we all watched a lot of great action scenes from MCU i really disappointed after watching this one."
819,10,"Jump out of your seat action Ya, I jumped out of my seat about three times.The family drama was a bit over used as the glue that held the movie together, that aside the action was inspiring. Im going to need to see this movie in slow motion to analyze the scenes. I give it a ten for all the explosions and jump scenes."
820,9,"My first ever MCU movie Never seen an MCU movie before, had to watch this because of the hype. Fell in love with the Romanoff sisters so had to go and watch all the movies with Natasha. Crestfallen to find out she's already been killed off, and given the spat with Disney we'll never see her again, even if Scarlet decided she wanted to reprise the role. Not quite the same sadness as when Root died in Person of Interest but still pretty sad. Loved the chemistry between the two sisters and the helicopter rescue scene was really good!"
821,6,"Quite an average marvel film😕 The film was good but what made it bad was how it did not tell you all the storyline till half way through the film also I thought alot more comedy would of made this a hit movie,I love how the main characters are women and the message it shows to people."
822,4,"Not a good movie. This is not a good movie. It wouldn't be a good movie as a stand alone story but it is totally overshadowed by so many higher quality entries in the MCU universe. For comparison, 2011 Hanna was a better movie, by a long shot.Black Widow deserved so much better. No super soldiers, tech, or lame super suits. This is one origin story I really wanted to see. I wanted to see her take on the people who supervised her during her Red Room years. There is a brilliant, intimate vengeful storyline that could've existed here that stood it apart from the world ending storylines that the MCU favours.I'm sad to see ScarJo's Black Widow time at the MCU go out this way."
823,4,"Not Marvel-lous, but VERY Hollywood. I only made it to the 40th minute, this snapshot of the movie consisted of = CGI chase scene, OTT fight scene, CGI chase scene, OTT fight scene, CGI chase scene.... If you look very closely you can see a pattern emerging. I noped out of the rest before seeing if the mind-numbing pattern continued for the rest of the 135 minute run time before my brain turned completely to mush."
824,7,"Florence, my beloved. The opening scene was incredible... the rest of the film was just a Marvel movie."
825,10,"Outstanding Action-Espionage Thriller Loved the Movie, at times the action seemed non-stop, almost like Terminator 2 where it comes one after the other.Overall it reminds me a lot of The Winter Soldier where it is mainly an Action-Espionage Thriller. I love the Twists, very smartly done.It also has a lot of Heart in it, especially the Scenes when the Family was together. A Must Watch for me."
826,7,"I suspended my desbelief to the maximum degree and enjoyed it It has idiotic over the top action (like all the Marvel movies). The heroes have plot armor (like literally in all the Marvel movies). The villains are serviceable at best (like in every Marvel movie except Avengers, Infinity War and Black Panther). And the humor is too childish for the most part (Marvel formula).And yet you are all bother by this ON THIS ONE?You all love Black Panther, with the villain being a gazillion times more interesting than the protagonist, yet you are bother by Natasha's sister being more interesting in this one? You suddenly care about the realism of the action sequences? Hypocrites!The characters motivations are some of the best in all the MCU, the conversations and quiet scenes might as well be the best in the whole run, and the twists at the end were good enough to create a fairly surprising ending."
827,10,"A Silent Commentary to powerful women Black Widow may not be the comedy filled scripting that we see in Avengers, Thor, Iron-Man, but that doesn't mean it any short of a good action movie. A VERY strong choice of female protagonists and a story that transcends the value of girl in our society. The story is worthy alone of how exciting the origins and depth of Black Widow. Male viewers may not like it as much as other Marvel movies, but this movie really struct a cord for the female demographic. I wish that Black Widow had a tv series to expand more of the character how how Scarlet is kinda of overlooked of the Avengers. This might be a action pack movie, but the story really puts perspective of some social issues that need to change. I hold this movie very dearly, more than any Marvel movie. Watch it!"
828,2,Boring In France they call this Le BoringDisney interns can downvote honest reviews like mine all they want but the truth is outScarlet Johansson should retire.
829,7,"A Formulaic Yet Entertaining Marvel Movie The first half of Black Widow is an interesting spy drama with a focus on Natasha's mental state after Civil War. The second half of the movie, on the other hand, is just another bland, formulaic yet entertaining marvel movie with a weak villain and weak resolution to Natasha's moral conflict throughout the film."
830,5,"Average Marvel flick Another fairly entertaining, but mostly disposable half-assed Marvel film. Perhaps it could have been a hit if it was released a decade ago, but these formulaic superhero flicks are definitely starting to grow outmoded. It's never terrible but just too naively written and visibly lazy in execution. Yet, I feel that it's the flaws that made the film so enjoyable to my taste.The usual Marvel template gets updated with a bunch of spy thriller stereotypes in the veins of ""Mission: Impossible"" and a beating heart for family affairs that made me inevitably think of ""The Incredibles"" or even ""Spy Kids"". The ensemble cast has good chemistry, and, despite the emotional moments falling terribly flat and the gags feeling like they were written in the 90s, watching the characters interact was more than pleasant. The Russian accents coming and going for no apparent reason bothered me at first, but after hearing Ray Winstone's, I just stopped caring about it altogether.Needless to say, the action scenes are always fun to watch. I just wish they would stop relying on confusing fast cuts and distracting CGI flourishes, though. I was actually surprised to read so many names in the special effects department as some of the chroma key shots were absolutely atrocious (the one with Yelena getting blasted away by an explosion deserves special mention). Still, the most distracting thing of the whole movie was Natasha's smart solution to resist the villain's pheromones, possibly the most WTF moment since the infamous ""rubber lips"" in ""Batman & Robin""."
831,4,"Chose a leg to stand on This movie suffers from indecisiveness. They wanna tell the story of a woman stripped of her humanity through childhood trauma and brainwash. They wanna tell the story of the pain of being human without emotion, of how love can overcome the scientifics of mans greed and lost for violence. They wanna tell the story of the saultry, ice cold, sexy, kick-ass Avenger Black Widow.They don't. They tell some random filler-episode in between the other, real Marvel-movies. You know, the ones with the money and the nice scripts and strong female characters. And the actual educated CGI-team.It's like they made this movie three times, -a comedy, a drama and an actual Marvel-movie-, and trashed it one after the other so the end product is a mishmash of them all and therefore doesn't excel as any of it.We don't get the BW origin. We don't get to see her get snatched from her mothers arms or shaped by stone cold Russian matrons in an all girls secret agents school. We don't get to see her struggle to fit in, to achieve goals, to form bonds with others in her situation. We don't get to see the ruthless BW before she met Barton and reformed some kind of humanity again. All we get is a medley of pictures with fakes christmases and girls moving in unison.Wtho even is the protagonist? Scarlet show us sides of a character we sure as hell have never met before. And the blonde girl, didn't even remember her name, she's the one starting, AND finishing, the plot line. And the antagonist?! Who is this man in a suit who, for some reason, in a ""twist"" of events has the plan to reduce the world female population? It's like they're making a parody of a ""go girls go!""-marvel movie. Any breathing person on this planet knows this was to be ""the first female superhero movie"" - and that they missed the date with about a decade. And they missed the mark, but seriously, I didn't watch this to see some feminist angled action (and I've got both pink hair, thick glasses and a nose ring!) but I put this on to watch Marvel! And I got jack poop.Not even the wonderful Rachel Weisz could save this. And the dad from Stranger Things, who's main thing is burly charm, gets the possibly least charming burly man ever to play. It's like they went ""oh no, children being brainwashed, a family who can't have real relationships - man, this u getting kinda heavy! We need to lighten it up! Let's make the dad, the one who betrays the little girls to the core, and make him the comic release! Let's get him a known face who'll make people live him just the same. Great idea, Frank!""Idiots."
832,6,"Starts bad but gets better I found the first half hour or so dragging on way too long, but it gets better once all the characters get introduced. Harbour and Pugh were both great additions to MCU, and their performances were the highlight of the film in my opinion.For me, the biggest flaws of the movie were some of the visual effects. The fire/explosions look really weird, and they often don't even shine light on the environments. They're also way too dark for the scenes, and they always move in slow motion for some reason. Also, some of the green-screening is great, but some of it looks really weird, too.Aside from some other minor gripes with the story and consistent physics rules, it was enjoyable. The story stands totally apart from the other MCU films, so you don't really have to worry about being confused on the timeline if you haven't seen them."
833,5,"Weakest MCU movie yet... Way too much unnecessary cgi, and overused slow motion, that really makes this film feel like a tacky timeline filler. There were some alright moments and Florence Pugh was probably the one redeeming quality of the film, But the overall plot was dreadful and uninteresting in my opinion."
834,1,"Disney hates their fans & disrespects the fans again!!! More ""WOKE"" agenda garbage. Such a pity Disney cannot make content for fans anymore. It's all about ""the message"" now. Fans want good storytelling & true to the source material fantasy guys. Get a grip before us fans are completely alienated & you lose us forever. You're living on borrowed time now Disney, last chance!"
835,8,"Great fun! More Florence Pugh please! Ignore the haters; enjoy a cool movie.Cool and beautiful chicks being smarmy and violent? Check.Outrageous and unbelievable action set pieces? Check.A good pace and no lifetime channel tragedy filler? Check.Now for the disclaimers:This movie obviously cost slightly less than the zillion dollars each Avengers movie did.It doesn't flow perfectly at times.Some of the resolution is a bit underwhelming.Still deserves an 8.And yes, Florence Pugh steals the show."
836,5,"Get a life marvel and stop being so un-realistic We have an immortal running around in a mission that is completely unrealistic and lame. To be fair my main character was the blonde. She was the only realistic thing about the movie. Yet another waste of our time by marvel. I say it again"" the Disney effect has struck again."""
837,8,"avarage plot Well most of it is predicdable, but still a very nice flick and i greatly enjoyed the background storys. It does give a depth to the character. With less then 10 min left of movie i do still feel like there ALOT missing, leaving me abit unsatisfied. Wich make me a belive a spinoff might occurs?But as for the real raising star, i really like to see Florence Pugh in her own story, lil sis of black widow. She stole the scene so did David Harbour , i like to see more of their view of story.Rachel Weisz did what she do best look confusing most of the timesAnd at some moments it felt like Ray Winstone borrowed alot of Gandolfinis potrait of goodfather and that alone was a huge turn of. There is only one Gandolfini. As overall movie has alot of satisfaction but loose abit of crem*e in the end due to unsatifaction."
838,5,"good for one view, but WHAT HAPPENED IN BUDAPEST? Average flick, don't worry if you miss it, but if you're a Marvel fan it's worth one watch. Speaking of Marvel fans, even casual ones will be familiar with Clint and Natasha bantering ""We remember Budapest very differently"". I wouldn't bet the farm that this film would pay off on that wonderful tease, and when they made a point of how the characters pronounce Budapest, and the movie spent most of its time there, I couldn't wait! But no. No payoff. Nothing. It was good for a popcorn flick but Marvel's best? This ain't. The best thing I can say about it is the nearly-all-female cast and the constant, well deserved pot-shots at masculinity that are peppered throughout. But as another reviewer noted, it all just feels so forced."
839,1,Boring Given the fact that her character was so amazing in her other films was probably the reason I was so disappointed. It was just a boring very boring movie. I think I'm done with the avengers series. After watching Black Widow I realize they're running out of material!!! So disappointed.
840,6,I'm not sure Very good movie but the star is getting her a.. kicked by everyone not good everyone is a match to her powers come on do better then this.
841,7,One more MCU film One more MCU film It's a film with little to highlight. The chemistry between Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova is the best part of the film along with the opening. After that it's more of the same.
842,5,Marvel but not marvel Watched the movie and felt like nothing is connecting... The movie was bad and boring and not like other marvel movies.I think after they pulled out the Loki series and Wanda vision and falcon they could atleast try make something good as the series.
843,9,"Just Loved it!!! According to my own personal opinion this movie is really great. I have waited long time to see this. I know that the storyline of this movie is kinda flat and we can guess what will happen in the end of the movie before even seeing that. But my opinion is just that thing dont define what a good film is. There are other things to consider too. That's why I have given it 9 star,without giving it 10.Now about the movie, I really liked all the family scenes. Also the actions were pretry much great too. Love to see Valentina here too as well as in the ""Falcon and the winter soldier"". Maybe she will be the new leader of the new generation MCU faces like Yelena and American Agent. Also I will love to See yelena and barton's rivalry in the "" Hawkeye"". Eagerly waiting for future MCU projets!!! 😍"
844,4,Saw this today with my 11 year old son My son liked Black Widow. I think his appreciation for the video comes mostly from how many shots are fired and how many explosions there are. I have more complex views to evaluate.I thought this was the worst Marvel video out of the dozen or so I've watched. I blame it all on the director.There were many scenes where the camera was in way too tight. It was difficult to follow the action to even get a sense of which of the two fighting was winning or not.This video would have been much better if I had seen the Marvel comic behind the story. The video did not do a good job of standing on its own. It was difficult to figure out the overall story.Even though my son enjoyed the movie even he spoke up a few times saying nobody could live through some action scenes. Do super heros feel pain? Do they heal a few instances after being badly beaten?There were a few good Marvel sized action scenes. Way too many frames devoted to non-action.To me the movie was a disappointment.The best thing about this move was my son and I spending time together.
845,3,Almost fell asleep Almost fell asleep in the cinema watching this and wanted to just walk out at some point but decided to remain in the hope the it would change for the better. One of the most boring marvel movies out there with an uninteresting plot.
846,10,"Amazing marvel film- ten years in the making Loved this movie. I loved the acting, the stunts, the humor, and the little piece of back story we gained on Natasha Romanov.I don't understand the bad reviews and quite honestly I'm going to guess that it's due to a bit of sexism as this is the first mcu female director, and an all star, primarily female, cast. I had to make an account in here just to disparage the totally wrong, poor reviews.Black widow has possibly one of the most tragic backstories in mcu and while I think she deserved more of a movie regarding her origin this was so good. Also fricken finally marvel, this has been a long time coming.Natasha Romanov is probably the best avenger. She comes from a tragic back story and tries to fix her ""wrongs"", as she was a trained, abused, and manipulated assassin, by serving as an avenger and protecting her friends and civilians.Black widow has heart, it shows some real intricacies regarding how the world views girls as totally ""disposable"" and where Natasha's original protective instincts come from- protecting her baby ""sister"".I've seen this movie twice and will probably watch it many more times. The chemistry between Johansson and Pugh is amazing and again, the humor and action are unbelievable and amazing.Watch it, you won't regret it."
847,8,"Not so good and not so bad too. Black Widow (2021) is not as great as other Marvel movies like Avengers, Black Panther, Ant Man, etc, but it is not bad too. As always, Marvel did a great job this time too and I think the story was good. I am a big Marvel fan that's why I usually like the movies. I will say the same for others who are Marvel fans they will also like this movie."
848,3,"Roman Tiles The Roman's used small ceramic tiles to create pictures. This movie had so many segnented tiles or bits of unrelated mini-mini mosaics of storylines, it became a jigsaw puzzle of action flipflop meaning . If you like studying minute infinite GFI creations that somehow embodies a whole with the barest of dialog, that strings along in a choppy fashion, you will like this movie."
849,7,Average and OK movie... Disney side kicked Scarlett Johnson even in her own movie...😂 The plot was always around Yelena and it felt like Black Widow is just a supporting character which is present only to help developing Yelena's character.Loved the way Marvel included a kind of family drama in movies.... And those sarcastic lines in some scenes impressed me... But yeah.... It could have been much much better than it is.
850,2,Just extremely boring I did not know if I want to watch it to the end. Just wasted time. There were really interesting Marvell movies before... This is not the one of them.
851,6,Black Widow Black Widow gets a standalone prequel that owes more than a nod to James Bond. There is even a glimpse of Roger Moore in Moonraker.I wonder if Disney were eyeing up a purchase of MGM before Amazon swooped in. It was one way to get their hands on 007.The movie opens in 1995. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) and their daughters Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) suddenly have to leave America.They are Russian sleeper agents and they have been exposed. The family have been working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) and they are not a real family.In 2016 after the events of Civil War. Natasha is on the run. Yelena kills a rogue former Black Widow and comes in contact with a synthetic gas. The frees her from a chemical that controls her mind. She is an operative of Dreykov.Both Natasha and Yelena reunite and then later get together with their surrogate parents. They want to bring down Dreykov who Natasha tried to assassinate some years earlier.After the events of Avengers: Endgame. There is something small scale about Black Widow. Nothing high stakes such as the fate of the entire universe being in peril. The movie suffers from not being a bombastic superhero movie.It really is an efficient spy/action movie with a couple of twists and turn. Harbour provides comedy as the Red Guardian. Weisz if effective as the mother figure but is underused.Winstone though seems to be coasting as the villain with a shifting Russian accent.
852,6,The only way from the top is down. This picture didn't give us what we expected from marvel about this character The movie wasn't that good if you like fast and furious franchise then you will like this movie but it's not as good as any marvel movie not like iron man or thor or captin America.
853,9,Great film with loads of action and an awesome story line I never use to be a huge fan of Marvel films because I was never in a super hero's that much. I think marvel have been doing a really good job with expanding their films into a wider audience but keeping to their routes at the same time. They have managed to make Super heroes fit into the more modern generation of films.I didn't watch expendables but this never effected my enjoyment of this film as the script was written in a way where you understood what you needed to if you didn't watch any of them so props there.Definitely give this film a watch if you haven't done so already!
854,1,"Just awful, one of the worst of the MCU Way too much CGI. Waaaay too much dialogue and exposition. Too many little quips and attempts at the usual MCU humour that got old after Iron Man."
855,9,Don't listen to the bad reviews I was so positively surprised after reading the bad reviews and then watching the movie!!!!This is a great MCU movie and a must watch.Scarlet is stunning as usual.
856,4,"what a waste Good actresses, but no plot boom boom is not a scenario."
857,3,"Took a generic film and attached some Marvel names to it! No. This is the worst Marvel movies created so far. Yo, director....there are more to film other than her bottom you know. But in lack of a story we film some behinds to get (some) male audience. If the sound track didn't include some of the Marvel theme song i wouldn't know that this is a Marvel movie. I can understand why Scarlett Johansson sued them...."
858,8,"Great relationship between Natascha and her sister Yelena! I found this movie to be very entertaining, and I reveled in seeing Natascha's character getting some more screen-time and character development. If you want to see a pretty fast-paced movie with some funny side-characters, and watch Natascha and Yelena's complicated but ultimately sweet relationship develop, this movie is for you.My two main complaints about this otherwise great movie-experience are: 1. The action stunts towards the end of the movie seemed unfitting, a human body could absolutely not sustain the injuries. We suspend our disbelief when there are ""super soldiers"", demigods etc. But it was a shame to see that with one of the few human characters they still went for a ""brute force"" narrative in terms of action.2. We get a glimpse of what Natascha's old moral code used to be, and to not give away spoilers I simply would have loved to see more of that. She is a morally ambiguous character who changes during her time with the Avengers. Give me that deep character development! Let me root for my morally ambiguous character! Let her be gritty!All in all, I still had heaps of fun watching this movie and I personally dont think it deserves some of the heavy criticism its getting."
859,4,"Weak film Alright, let's go straight to the point this is one of the worst Marvel movies, with a terrible script with everything being resolved very quickly, I liked Yelena a lot but the other characters are very silly and not at all charismatic, besides the villain who is a serious rival to Mandarin in Iron Man 3 as Marvel's worst villain, in short it's a movie far below the standard Marvel quality a real disappointment, and please Disney stop being deadbeat and pay Scarlet."
860,4,"Fell asleep The worst MCU movie made so far. The action is few and far between and it seems almost unnecessary in some of the places it does exist. I fell asleep an hour into the movie because it did such a terrible job of grabbing my attention. I asked my Marvel-loving friends and most said I wasn't missing much by not finishing the film. I am sure I will eventually finish it, but I don't expect my review to change much."
861,2,"Trash Fest!!! One of the worst Marvel movies out there. Did any of the producers actually see this movie before release? The level of cringe-drama sets a new record high. Make sure before deciding to watch this, that y ou won't get that time back. Ever."
862,7,Pugh to the rescue Self awareness all the way is exhausting. Pugh often carries them out of their own black holes.
863,1,Boring boring boring I was so excited to watch this movie. The first 45 mins was soooo boring. This had so much potential. Disappointed.
864,5,"A missed opportunity and slight disappointment Chrisblogger8g 2/4 Black Widow (2021) Review date: 12 August 2021When I first took note of the character Black Widow, which was in Iron Man 2 or The Avengers, I was wondering - other superheroes like Captain America, Thor and Iron Man have their standalone movies, but where's Black Widow's? Ten years pass and here I am, sitting in front of the screen, disappointed, after watching Black Widow.Black Widow just feels like a missed opportunity to expand more about the character of Natasha Romanoff, and instead swerves into a search-and-rescue mission of trained assassins held captive in the 'Red Room'.Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016) and before Infinity War (2018), Black Widow talks about its main character, Natasha Romanoff, who has to confront her past linked to a dangerous conspiracy (long before she became an Avenger), and in the meantime is also is being pursued by a force that will take her down no matter what.At first, we get to see two children playing with each other, while they learn the word bioluminescence, which contributes nothing to the story at all. Later, during dinner, they are informed that they have to leave the house and boards a plane to Cuba (am I right?) and the plot just gets even more confusing there, with 'Resident Evil'-like editing which makes me wonder whether the editor was having a fight with a grizzly bear or ferocious tiger.I won't give out too much spoilers here, but the plot gets even more absurd, especially how the movie resolves little to none during the first half-an-hour, besides slapping us with action scenes. The movie feels slightly better when the characters talk to each other, we can start to see a little character development, when all of a sudden, we are disrupted with another action sequence, which wasted the whole potential build-up scenes. This, I think, would happen three or four times more in the movie.Weisz's character Melina takes a drastic turn as she suddenly becomes 'evil' but then Black Widow bombards us with another laughable flashback that makes the plot ridiculous instead. I laughed again in another lame flashback to 'sever the nerve'. Besides these flashbacks, we are struck with information overload when Romanoff, dressed as Melina, learns more about how universal the members of the Red Room are.To summarize things up, I felt like Black Widow could have explored a different aspect, like Natasha and her sister growing up in the Red Room, and how she escaped it and became the Avenger, but I guess, reality is often disappointing.Ah, I just remembered. Florence Pugh's performance is not convincing enough. It feels like every dialogue she speaks is monotonous and dull, except for the part where she used a stick to mess with the helicopter. I just feel that she doesn't have the energy or spark in her, while other actors at least give decent performances. One more thing before I finish this review, the villain called the Taskmaster feels very wasted. In what could have been a deeper exploration of the character itself ends on the wrong note.You may disagree with my review here. Black Widow currently has a 6.8/10 on IMDb, a staggering 80% on Rotten Tomatoes or a Metascore of 67, but believe me, Marvel can do a better job than a search-and-rescue, confusing, information overload movie."
865,3,"Why comment since it will not be broadcast due to censorship. Ask the people for 200 million for health and they will laugh at you.Ask him $ 1 billion for a movie and he'll be happy to pay it.Another lousy movie, but one from Hollywood. So, something divine and scenarios worthy of the Gods.A lot of money at Hollywood. Your money!Thanks People."
866,10,"You must be joking Several reviews referenced how this movie doesn't coincide with the real timeline.These people are idiots.THIS IS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE!Of course the Natasha's history is different.Are you basement dwelling morons serious?My God! It's a freaking movie!Stop acting ""holier than thou"" !I will never understand you ""fake"" purists. Either the movie is good or it's garbage.You trolls should be grateful that there is even a movie for you watch.It's insulting that you, wet behind the ears dopes give negative reviews!Grow up and be thankful!You are not privileged!Hell, you are not even special!You are misguided spoiled brats.And honestly, everyone one of you are a huge joke!Your opinion doesn't mean dick! Especially because you have not earned one."
867,7,"Sisterhood And Family I know...you are sick of it. Vin Diesel has the monopoly on family and outrageous plots.Admittedly I am NOT a Marvel fan or comic book fan in general but I was moved by the core of this movie. Which is...family can be built from past trauma. And boy...is it traumatic. Part ""Salt"" part ""Moonraker"" (which they put into this movie!) It is about human trafficking...and about using it for nefarious means. Again, I know nothing about Natasha or Yelena or whatever so I'm basing it strictly on what's in front of me. Which is A family drama. Well...sort of. They were never a family yet find ways to be one and if you come from dysfunction...it's as moving as it will be relatable. The rest...well...it's obviously still a comic book. To me...this makes more sense then say...an entire group of folks who have no connection. So to me...this was a solid stand alone flick. Nice bum shots to please the incels. Good drama for the adults. Not really for kids."
868,10,How wrong are the critics!!!! 50 years old. Collected Marvel & DC comics since I was 10years old. Love and appreciate most film genre's..... In a nutshell..... This film is absolutely brilliant!!!!
869,5,"Even without the hype, I still got disappointed This movie is just weird. It tries to be a dark spy movie, but using the Marvel formula. At first, you think it's going to be a dark action movie, judging by the amazing opening credits, but it turned out to be a half dark, half colorful messThe plot is absolutely pointless, and the villains are completely forgettable. Taskmaster was a massive disapointment, and not to mention Dreykov and the widows. Halfway through the film, the dialogue was so boring that I was forcing myself not to fall asleep, and the third act is completely nonsense, with noticeable CGI.The comedy is OK. Red Guardian is the comic relief of the movie, sometimes he gets the jokes right, sometimes not. The action/fighting sequences are lame and the score is meh.The best scene of the movie was the post-credit scene, which didn't fail to get me excited for the future of the MCU. Also, there were some nice comebacks from previous movies, which I enjoyed very much.The star of the movie was definetly Yelena Belova. Even with the bad script, Florence Pugh still managed to portray her character amazingly, I'm excited to see where her character is going from now on."
870,8,"Love it Loved the storyline. I liked the humor in the film, they didn't take themselves to seriously. The pace of the movie was good. Had me on the tip of my seat most of the time."
871,1,What a piece of stinky garbage. Marvel is known for its stupid childish CGI comedy movies. They made movies for 10 year old. And this is just another piece of garbage in marvel trashcan.
872,7,"It is what it is. Regardless of how much I specter of this movie, I still enjoyed it. I expected a better plot and a better goodbye for black widow.I did however enjoyed her sister, she was the best part of the movie. I would watch again because I'm a huge marvel fan but definitely not my favorite."
873,4,My thoughts My thoughts on black widow are that this movie is very predictable and boring. I honestly tried to give this movie a chance but I did not like it at all. It tries to be captain America the winter soldier and it does not succeed. They ruined taskmaster by making her bland and gender-swapping a really awesome comic book character. You could see all the twists coming. They action was very over the top and nonsensical and very hard to believe. It felt way too long and it was hard to stay awake through it. I think if this came out before endgame it would have made more sense and probably been a lot better. I give black widow a 4.5/10.
874,6,"Very mediocre. Cheap thrills, little substance. First thing: HOLY CRAP DOES EVER EVER LOOK LIKE HER MOM! While unfortunately not as ravishingly beautiful as Milla was as a pup, I literally recognized her as Milla's child and had never even seen her before, and looked it up and sure enough, tada. WOW. Some very genetic Milla eyes! (I always felt Milla should have been cloned) . I also appreciate what they tried to do casting Natasha's sister, you want to get someone similarly proportioned, but don't want to outshine her, which could be difficult given Scarlett isn't your typical supermodel build or beauty. It would have been interesting to have seen Oleysa Rulin in the role. I tried my best to invest myself in the story, but it was a little simplistic and linear, and by the time they got around to doing anything significant I just didn't really care what was happening anymore. This sort of storyline concept would have done much better if it was drawn out into a longer television series, you could have put a lot more stakes on the whole ""mind control"" thing and ultimately made the rest of the ""widows"" into characters worth fighting, fighting for, and saving. Here they try to condense the concept into a film, but what happens is just volley of plot information followed by a bunch of action sequences and there is never much investment aside from the very forced attempt at the familiy drama surrounding Black Widow, Red Guardian and the fam. One of my biggest beefs with the decisions made making this film was opting to make all the characters speak with a poorly-imitated Russian accent - honestly, at that point, just have everyone speak English with their normal accents or whatever, because the accents were so poorly acted that none of the characters could develop any semblance of nuance, making them very cardboard-like. I really wanted to enjoy this far more than WW1984, but it was very comparably mediocre. It's like they just want to throw budgets at fluff and see who comes to pay for it, particularly with films of the superhero variety these days. Honestly, post-Avengers/X-Men/Thor it feels like the well has run dry and sadly the best of the superhero films from the major comic companies are behind us, and we're sliding into another superhero film dark age as the best the genre has to offer has now taken the form of TV series like The Boys and Jupiter's Legacy, which follow in the footsteps of great series like Heroes, Playstation Network's Powers and Netflix's Daredevil. Honestly Black Widow should have been a series, same budget, longer investment and more depth to the story. As is, it wasn't very interesting, and certainly was no better than one of the Hulk films, which were widely considered a bust (though personally I still very much enjoyed Ang Lee's)."
875,3,"Painfully disappointing Things move along well enough until the ""family"" is reunited. From there the movie loses any understanding of itself. Is it a comedy? An action adventure?The childish feminist tropes like ""men only think women are mad when they are having their periods"" is dated and childish.I got out to check on my dog and missed 15 minutes of the movie's ""family reunion"" scene and didn't miss anything plot wise. Just a waste of screen time."
876,10,"Excellent movie! Action packed, funny, brilliant acting. I fell in love with new character, Yelena straight away. The plot was excellent, the stunts looked phenomenal."
877,9,"Satisfying After waiting so long we got this movie, and it doesn't disappoint. Action scenes are very good, story is also good and not just action/adventure, it include emotion, Natasha's re-union with her family."
878,3,"Disappointed Ok let's get the obvious big stuff out of the way.Yes Disney didn't pay scarlet what they contractually agreed to so they deserve to be sued.Right on to the film.It's an almost pointless story, that butchers the character of taskmaster because the writers and producers couldn't work out how the character from the comics would work in a movie (they've been at this more than 10 years though).Scarlet plays her part fine, the other characters are almost entirely replaceable (I don't buy into florences hype) and red guardian is the only redeeming thing here.Honestly by the end of the film I was just tired. I expected winter soldier levels of action and suspense and got about 30% of that.Two questions, first: why on earth was the taskmaster change approved?Second: why on earth choose ray winston? Was no one else, literally no one on earth available? A cockney Russian? Wow.Anyways to summarise, just like solo a Star Wars movie was an origin story for his gun, this film is an origin story for a utility vest that no one paid attention to in infinity war. I'm serious, that's really the only takeaway from this movie. I won't be revisiting it."
879,7,"This movie is average compared to other MCU movies. Very Average.Going in, I didn't really know what to expect. MCU movies are usually awesome, but this one was average. The plot wasn't that interesting. It was too bland, and it sometimes fails to explain things so most times I don't even know what is going on. I also think that Taskmaster had a lot of potential, but just ended up being an average character that was ""meh"".This movie was wasted potential. Still somewhat liked it. Definitely not worth premium access though."
880,5,"Once was enough This is the first MCU movie in ten plus years that I have absolutely no desire to ever re-watch; simply put, it was dull with too many unnecessary plot elements and characters. I at least give kudos to Scar-Jo for not attempting a horrible Russian accent."
881,10,"Fitting end for an incredible character. Other than the post credit scene, it is the perfect send off movie."
882,8,"It deserves an easy 8.4. An outstanding film This movie is I agree , one of the best movies to come out of marvel . Though it released two years after the last Avengers . It elaborates the story of Natasha Romanoff a.k.a (also known as) Black Widow. Surprisingly when we look at the original Avengers team . It comprises of the Widow , but she surely deserved her separate movie . Just like the rest of the Avengers . So here's where we see how it turns out with her origin . The action, stunts, drama, emotions, casting, story . Everything from A to Z absolutely sizzles, dazzles and is remarkable . This has to be one of if not the absolute best movies of Scarlet Johansson. The only thing which I wasn't liking was the weird connection which they were making with the Avengers movies which awkwardly was screwing up the story. Cause the story of this film takes place in between Age of Ultron and Infinity War. So it was mildly confusing many things ."
883,2,"Convoluted CGI catastrophe. Put simply, this movie doesn't need to exist and it's so badly written, it simply shouldn't exist. In parts boring, everywhere else mostly meaningless action. The MCU's best character has been given its worst movie."
884,10,best Best of beeeeeeeest.work best nice.thanks for all your movies.
885,9,"A beautiful homage, A spectacular send off I saw this movie twice, when it first came out, then after I binged all the other movies in the MCU. A lot of people are complaining about her not having a ""full role"" or being a ""sidekick"", the thing to really embrace about this movie is, that it isn't a traditional ""superhero movie"" it's an action packed hallmark filled with these small details that make it feel melancholiac. When it comes to The film , it's easy to sit there and criticize it. But alas that doesn't do this splendid film any justice. Everyone who complains, is looking at its face value, they're most likely not drawing parallels to the Marvel Comics Universe. I honestly liked the format and story direction in the movie, me being one who was always curious about her involvement in the MCU, let's just say I was pleased. And I hope Scarlet Johansson gets roles that amount to the great pleasure she gave dedicated MCU fans. She will always be our Black Widow."
886,3,"Cringefest + Clichés = Black Widow Had semi high hopes for this movie but unfortunatelly it was all for naught.The movie is from the very beginning a walking talking 90s action movie cliché with your generic Russian bad guys, fake russian accents, fake russian names.. the works. Add to it a forced ""bad-ass"" girl hero(s) that at 45kg super model body can defeat 100kg+ super soldiers and a very predictable plot... Total cringe-fest.I was only able to watch until the predictable and useless, but classic, reunion + making up fight between the main characters.This is the one MCU movie I will gladly skip."
887,7,"Not as bad as feared, but DC is doing it better right now. The bummer about this one is that the acting was really good, but the CGI fighting just overwhelmed the story telling and really was way too busy and jerky to enjoy. Most of the action sequences could have been trimmed way down and not lost any of their impact.Glad to see marvel give us a straight up villain who isn't complicated. He's a bad guy who needs to be defeated. Nice change from the TV shows.The weirdness with the Taskmaster being played by two different people thing was annoying. They should have matched the physical sizes of them better or spent some of the CGI budget fixing difference.It's a shame the we didn't get a Black Widow movie until it didn't matter in the story line and that Marvel felt the need to bury some really good acting under so much CGI spentabulousness."
888,6,"Fine action and nothing If you want to see some furious super heroic action sequences, then it is for you. Story is very predictive. Not so good. But it is entertaining nicely. Just go for it..."
889,1,Dumbest Marvel movie so far. Dumbest storyline ever in a marvel movie. I seriously got sleepy after 20 minutes of the movie.
890,10,The Black Widow Movie I've Been waiting for! I don't know why everybody is hating but I thought it was so good and cant wait for the continuation movie with Florence which you Know they will do.
891,3,Boring Boring story drama and quite good at action sequences.Just wanted to make Her solo movie.Extremely disappointed Tasky.
892,3,Boring Boring story and drama with good fighting sequence.Marvel just wanted to make her solo.
893,4,"The Winter Soldier 2.0 U wanna know how to destroy a villain? Just watch Black Widow! Its not a Natasha Romanoff solo movie, its a movie made to introduce the next Black Widow.The movie could also be called The Winter Soldier 2.The highlights of the movie are Red Guardian and the post-credit scene."
894,7,"A Not Bad MCU Entry The story of Black Widow in between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War.The movie was okay, but it did not contribute as much to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as I had hoped. It mostly works as a standalone film, and an introduction to the character Yelena. The highlight is Florence Pugh as Yelena, who I hope we see more of.The movie has lots of flaws, but works well enough as a standard summer action flick. I think the average person would enjoy it, and it could be a good entry point into the MCU. It's not bad by any means, but there are far better MCU films."
895,4,"Much Ado About Nothing. Let's see... The family-drama elements are no more potent or involving than an episode of any network TV series, the supposed touches of humour are uninspired & weak and the action is no more impressive or dynamic than every other Hollywood action film in recent memory.Let's also not overlook that if you lived undercover in America, with an American accent for years, you would not then in the space of a few years revert back to speaking barely decipherable broken english in a thick Russian accent."
896,6,"#Movie Review Black Widow (2021) is not what I expected. There were many things that bothered me with this movie to the point where I actually checked my watch a few times. I usually praise Marvel for their clever funny jokes but in this movie things are different. The jokes were not funny at all, a more adequate term would be lame. The concept of the story seems appealing but they messed it up big time to the point where I had no interest in the story anymore. There are huge problems with the pacing, the emotional connection and the overall plot is weak. There is a lot of talking and explaining stuff so when you finally get to the action scenes it's just some average random 0 emotional invested fights. The movie never actually takes the time to build a strong emotional side and this mistake backfires hard.Black Widow (2021) is a wasted opportunity of a great movie. It's a sloppy work. The important good parts are missing or are way too short and rushed while the bad parts are overly drawn out. Any attempt of building emotional connection is cut with a lame joke turning Black Widow (2021) into an empty shell."
897,3,"Dont watch I had some expectations bcs it is an MCU movie,but it was a disaster. I mean the CGI is bad,very bad,she is isnt even the main character in her own movie,lmao XD and why they have turned taskmaster in a women?"
898,8,"Super hero action fun, with great (true to life) characters starring in an original enticing story, which can definitely be enjoyed by adults as well. Recommended! I love it when an action movie has some good jokes, but I love it even more when a super hero movie has got GREAT CHARACTERS WHOM I CAN BELIEVE IN. Usually these superhero movies are only suited for kids, but this movie can be enjoyed by adults as well, because of these great character performances.The good: great characters, with true to life dialogues, who star in an original story that enticed me from beginning to end. It charmed me, it made me laugh, it excited me, but foremost it touched me because the characters arent made out of card board, but are real and human. This is quite UNIQUE (and praise worthy) for a super hero movie!Any bad? It is full on ridiculous CGI action, but however silly, it is done in a quite exciting way, because of the splendid editing and because of the terrific photography. The action ROCKS!The story of this superhero movie is (fortunately) not only about the superb action, but is mostly about the characters, who all fervently desire to belong to a loving family. Being cut out of ones family and finding your loved ones again is what this movie is all about.End note: WATCH the end credits till the very end, because there is a very touching and funny end segment, which many wont see otherwise!"
899,7,"Flawed but enjoyable farewell to Natasha The Good The banter between Natasha and Yelena is amazing. The one liners from Yelena is typical MCU. The bit about the female reproductive system is truly a highlight.The Bad Natasha is almost a sidekick rather than the main attraction. Which is sad. She totally deserved an amazing movie dedicated to her character. The other members of her family are sloppily handled. Alexei looked promising in the opening scenes, but was then poorly handled in the back end. The Red Guardian could have been used much better.The Ugly Why oh why did Disney and Marvel destroy Taskmaster so badly. Taskmaster is a well know villain and occasionally anti-hero. A mercenary with exceptional training. Taking the best price to sometime work for good, but most often for bad. And he, yes he, is a male character. In this movie, the MCU version is a mind controlled puppet who's able to learn the opponent's moves through bionic enhancements rather than being a skilled fighter. And they made the character female.I get that there a different storylines through the years. I also get that everything in the current era we're in demands more and more female characters. But changing a beloved character and butchering it like this is just poor decision making.Conclusion To enjoy this movie you need the following: 1 - Don't know who Taskmaster is, or accept that Marvel destroyed everything about the character to fit the script.2 - Realize that this is a nostalgic farewell to an amazing character and actresses who portrayed her.3 - Yelena plays a more significant role in the movie to set her up for future appearances in the MCU."
900,6,"Delayed, delayed, delayed..., but was it worth it? Thanks to the Covid pandemic, we had to wait ever such a long time for ""Black Widow"" to finally reach our screens, that additional wait only helped to build more and more hype for Marvel's next big feature film, but once it finally arrived, was it actually worth all that waiting?The answer is simply meh, ""Black Widow"" is okay and an enjoyable watch, but certainly not worth all the hype that it generated, and certainly not one of Marvel's strongest outings.It's basically an origin story at the beginning, then quickly moves to a period of time just after ""Captain America Civil War"" ends, so we're able to see what Natasha Romanoff got up to when she was away from The Avengers.In all honesty the film was pretty needless, although it was nice to see Romanoff get the spotlight for a change, instead of being outshone by another Avenger.The action scenes are pretty average, the CGI is typical Marvel level stuff, so not bad, the best part of the film though was being able to delve into Romanoff's backstory, seeing where she came from, what's happening with her and why, seeing her younger sister being introduced into the franchise, as well as seeing her parents and other characters associated with her.I cannot unfortunately rate it any higher because that would be an injustice to Marvel's better films, but it is a much needed return to the Marvel Universe after the pandemic, and essential viewing for anyone who follows the Marvel Universe."
901,8,"Much better than expected! My wife and myself watched it on Saturday. My expectations were low because of some of the reviews but we both really enjoyed it!Story line was good, character building was good, humour was very good, and the acting was good (yep even Ray Winston).We gave it a solid 8.Looking forward to getting the dvd and slotting it between Civil War and Black Panther and then watching the whole lot again."
902,6,Not what I expected but it was interesting. It sort of a flashback storyline. Natasha at the end took of for the skies. Scarlet Johansson was in tremendous shape and you could by her outfits that she had 5-6% body fat!
903,7,"A solid meh When it was announced that black widow would be getting her own movie, I went in from the start with meh expectations. At first, I wasn't even excited enough that I'd think to go see it. But after a two year break from cinema, I couldn't resist.What greeted me as I sat in my chair with a bag of malteasers and the lack of a cupholder on my chair, was what I can honestly only describe as the most textbook marvel movie to date. With all the expected beats and absolutely nothing surprising. By about 1/3rd into the movie I could assume just about everything that would happen following.Mind you I still enjoyed it, heck I enjoyed ant man and the wasp which is the definition of a by the books movie to date. But honestly, if it weren't for refreshing representations over on disney+ like wandavision and loki, I'd be beginning to write off the mcu going forward despite my huge fanboyness towards these movies. But hopefully the movies going forward will have a little more passion to them."
904,6,"Meh movie First of all, when you know this movie can't affect the main timeline in the MCU you aren't excited about this movie, so you need a great film. This is not the case, the movie was slow-paced, pretty boring. It's a good story, but nothing special, Scarlett Johansson's character deserved more. This is one of the weakest movies of Marvel. It is still watchable, though."
905,7,"I went in without expectations and enjoyed the film Personally, I thought the film was enjoyable at best. Yes, the story was a little slow, but the comedic relief moments were excellent. And getting insight into Natasha's past made it all the better. At this point we shouldn't be expecting complete comic book accuracy. It might be because I didn't expect much post-Endgame, but I thought the film was good. No better, no worse. But good and not a waste of a watch."
906,5,"Is this the Black Widow memoir you want? It was alright...that was about it. After the gravitas of her character choosing to bite it in Infinity War, it was a bit of a shrug. This may have landed a little better if it was done right after Iron Man 2. Give this character and her world more context while continuing to build the Infinity Saga, not post."
907,9,"think ""Bourne"" before you think ""Marvel"" When a movie impacts you the day after, you know it did something right.It was hard not to notice the similarities this would have to the Bourne movies in ScarJo's first scene, but that's a GOOD thing. Florence Pugh is absolutely amazing, and what's-his-name brought some nice levity to it overall.Coulda used an intro to establish it's place in the MCU timeline a bit. But let's face it, this should have been MADE in it's place in the MCU timeline... Has a somewhat typical Marvel too-much-going-on third act/last action scene, but Black Widow facing the other widows in the midst of it was awesomely brutal.Overall, I was pretty happy with this."
908,5,Do We really need a movie on Side kicks Tired of weird scientific project stories. Marvels if you need to make movies on side kicks you better come out with better scripts. This one does not cut any marks.
909,10,"This made my heart so happy and sad The intro is literally the best thing I have ever seen, love the slowed smells like teen spirit. So perfekt.The characters was just so cool, intresting and funny but had also a dark side, everything you want of the characters.Scarlett is a legend and this movie got me gossebumps the hole time. Love the dark story."
910,1,"""Supersoldier"" You show us the russian supersoldier, so strong that he can throw cars around and he crushes male soldiers like flies. But when he has to fight against a woman he is only aloud to wipe the floor with his face. Seriously, why did you make him a supersoldier? I am angry that I paid money for this trash."
911,2,"Worst movie ever? Hours of nonsensical cgi fighting, I gave this a two for the possibility that there is a movie I have seen in a theater that is worse and I have forgotten it. Within first 15 minutes, you know this isn't making much sense, and it goes downhill from there. No consistent plot, everything just thrown in as if an afterthought. Would give examples of how insultingly horrible and boring this was but guess would be spoiler and want to help others out there not waste hours and money watching what was more boring than my corporate law class. So bad, companion and I couldn't help laughing uncontrollably through much of second half. Bill Hurt -- how could you let yourself be in this (almost)? P. S. I very much enjoyed Ironman, so it's not that I can't get into a comic book movie."
912,5,Will they have a prequel to a prequel? This movie is so formulaic that is the same old story. They need to keep an object of power out of the hands of the lead villains. Have you noticed how these villains all have giant airships up in the clouds? Maybe they buy their evil lairs Criminals 'R' Us. For a human being Black Widow can take quite a beating and not even chip a nail. Don't get me started with Melinda who performed mind controlling experiments on innocent girls but gets a happy ending just because she helps Black Widow.
913,1,Marvel being marvel Worst movie I seen In a while. Marvel is bad at making movies. It's only for money and agendas now.
914,7,"good but not the best This film not meet my high expectations as a fan of all marvel's movies, so weird comedy put in the natasha's background family, usual fighting arts, and lack of scenarios."
915,5,"To much superhero stuff To be honest the last few years we had way to much superhero movies. Its not that the movie is bad, but im sick of superhero stuff."
916,7,"Solid MCU movie with poorly executed villain This was a solid film with a few inconsistencies and bumps along the way. Yelena and Natasha's dynamic is the emotional axis that this film revolves around, and in that respect the film does a great job. However, this movie felt like two different films edited together. Its opening credits were stunning, horrifying and emotional, and the first half of the film was action-packed and tightly paced. But what let this movie down was a poorly executed villain and a patchy finale. Taskmaster, while great conceptually, did not get nearly enough time for us to really appreciate the role she played in Natasha's guilt and haunted past. Freeing Taskmaster with the red gas was far too quick and easy a resolution, and felt underwhelming considering how much of a psychological threat she had posed to Natasha just moments before. I appreciate the concept of making Taskmaster Dreykov's daughter, but it felt like they didn't really embrace all the narrative possibilities that could entail.Still, overall, a decent superhero movie on par with the average MCU movie. Cut the scene with Scarlet Johansson's horrifying blonde wig (and also that gratuitous butt close-up while you're at it), and it could even be a little better."
917,6,"""Don't judge a movie by its poster"" A respectably decent Marvel movie worth the watch for some past-psychological emotional experience (since this movie takes place in 2016).The chemestry of is ""widow"" family converts nicely in what I'd believe is a realistic reunion. I loved the portrayal of the father (Red Guardian) and sister (Yelena). The comedy was pretty much on point where it was needed - and usually Marvel movies are too messy with this.However, the action scenes removed too much off the topping... As another IMDb reviewer wrote; the editor(s) struggled too much with covering the stunt-double from the camera, making the sequences giving headaches...this is probably one of the most unsatisfying movies when it comes to that; action. Though I at least have to give them credit for the ""intro sequence""...loved that, very iconic.But they overdid the music...as if they had to use every song on the soundtrack in order to not piss off the composer. Empty and slow sequences are often the build-up an emotional scene needs, but here they went all out trying to fill in as much as possible.But when it comes to the villain..? Where is the intimidation! Where is the build-up we as an audience expected? It was so lousily portrayed I felt like he was inevitably going to lose. With Thanos for example; we had no idea. He was so terrifying because his goals were so clearly set with meaning, I felt my jaw dropping.Yet, with all these psychological pasts of the main characters that felt like had to be redeemed in some way, this villain removes this satisfaction.And not to mention the villain's powerful minion who is pretty much only used for the action sequences.Felt like 7/10 was too generous...here you go Marvel (6/10).Love the poster tho."
918,8,Great movie. Really good movie with a few slow parts. But over all it's a must see.
919,8,"Great film! 4th time seeing Black Widow at the cinema and I can't get enough!!I've loved it from beginning to end, Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh made an astounding duo! Fantastic chemistry of the 2 actresses on screen! And Rachel Weisz and David Harbour completed the cast perfectly!!I usually enjoy MCU films but Black Widow is above the rest in my opinion! There was a perfect mix of action and funny moments. Florence's character have most of the best lines, she shines through this film but without stealing the spotlight from Natasha!I don't get the bad reviews, bad cgi, bad acting, too late for her to have her film etc... Really?? Misoginy at its worse! Somehow not surprised!!It was about time to get the focus on 2 female heroes!!! Not to mention how Disney did them dirty with the release on Disney+I had a great 4 times seeing it and it's very likely that I will see it again!"
920,2,"What's going on with Marvel Movies? Worst Marvel movie, 99.9% CGI...and not half of it good cgi. And by the way, she's not the main character in her own movie???"
921,4,"Boring Pugh (sister) was only decent performance, really boring, pointless movie."
922,7,"One of the better Marvel-movies Definitely one of the better Marvel-movies. Funny punchlines, logical actions, amazing fighting scenes, natural and believable human relations. We laughed several times of the awkward, but not cliché, lines from Red Guardian.I believe, as seen in Wonder Woman: 1984, the relatively low score to this movie is because the movie spent time focusing on human relations, and not only fighting due to too much testosterone. :-)"
923,5,"Bland. It wasn't that bad, it was just bland, didn't like the adaption of Taskmaster but it fit with the story, and some writing was stupid. The post credit scene set up a lot. I'm excited to see what happens. I rate it a 5.5/10."
924,3,"Pugh shines in a very disappointing film Slowest fast pace film you will ever watch. Scarlett johansson is terrible and such a side character. Florence Pugh shines, her accent her facial expressions are all class. Waste of rachel weizs too. Hard to connect with thier trauama which takes up a lot of the film."
925,5,"Big Budget.........Little Substance For the big effects and action sequences this 2 hour plus film gives you it leaves you pretty flat and unfulfilled. Scarlett Johansson was born to play the role of Black Widow but it looks as if the role is taking its toll on her as she pretty much sleep walks through the film. The great Rachel Weisz is hugely underused and David Harbour starts off as a troubled father/undercover agent then turns into some sort of bumbling aged superhero with one liners that are just not funny. Florence Pugh is about the only saving grace in this film acting wise but even her russian accent is as bad as the rest of the casts.When watching this film you find yourself waiting for the next action sequence and the monologues in between just filler until the next cgi explosion. Marvel have done a pretty decent job in most of their previous films developing characters that u actually care about so that the 2-3 hour run time that all Marvel films seem to have now don't seem so long. Unfortunately with Black Widow they failed miserably and even the half decent action sequences can't save this film from itself.Marvel need to realise not all their films need to be sprawling epics, sometimes less is more and i feel if some of the unnecessary drawn out scenes would have been left on the cutting room floor we would have ended up with a 100-110 minute more polished action flick."
926,8,"I liked it! I honestly don't know what everyone's complaining about. Aside from some timeline issues, I thought it was a really fun movie. I like what it seems to be setting up as well. Would watch again."
927,1,"Compared to the rest, awful Compared to the rest, awful.Compared to the rest, awful."
928,7,Here for Scarlet Johansson She saved this film. An average marvel flick but thankfully Scarlet Johansson made it worth watching. 7 from me.
929,6,"Disappointed The movie got me hyped for almost 2 years, but it wasn't what I expected, this is an average Marvel movie that was more of a way to put an unnecessary story of black widow, the only purpose that I found in the movie is to set a future marvel project that you will now in the post-credit scene that I will not talk about because it will be a spoiler, but the post-credit scene is the only one that affects the MCU."
930,5,"Mediocre movie top 5 worst MCU easy It's not a bad movie but it's not a good one by any means It's a pity the first and only Black Window film was so soulless The movie is 5 years late easy. The ending especially is just loud action scenes and explosions no meaning whatsoever.She had a perfect character ending in Endgame, and then they make a prequel movie right after the events of Civil war which didn't contribute to the character or the overall story The film was purely made to make money with a generic plot.Little they know COVID happened and they didn't even make that, such an irony."
931,10,"Exactly what I wanted for Natasha. First off I do not understand why this film has gotten so much hate...I have been waiting for this since Natasha first appeared in the Mavel universe and it did not disappoint at all.It was a film that explored family in a different way and for the character of Natasha that has always been a big part of her. So they did an amazing job in my oppinion on focusing one what was important to Natasha.The characters, script and story is amazing and Marvel definitely hit the right note with this film. I can't wait to see it again.From start to finish I was hooked. The action scenes were balanced with heartfelt and comedic ones perfectly. The story itself was brilliant too, the idea behind the controlling villain was done really well and his connections to the family were also well thought out and made the story much more intricate than it otherwise would have been.Yelena comes in as a new character but honestly was fantastic opposite Natasha. The sisterly bond was done to perfection and I can't wait to see where Yelena goes next...maybe she'll get her own film too? One can only hope that's the case and that she isn't sidelined to the t.v series as I think she deserves more than that.This all may sound a little enthusiastic but I have been waiting for this film for so long and it was exactly what I wanted. I'm not sure why people are review bombing it to be honest. Maybe people expected something more Thor or Iron man like but Natasha is Natasha and this film explored her character arc perfectly for me."
932,1,"Terrible boring movie Just a boring movie, a silly story, that you can tell in five minutes, so they filled it with a lot chasing and fighting, boring, boring, boring."
933,2,"Black widow in white Well, doesn't matter. Disney has no clue and never did, but Black Widow was always a minor useless character in marvel anyway. This won't change it.Film brought to you by The Mall Owners' Association Of America. ""make a purchase today!""PS: why does she do cartwheels when she can just walk over?"
934,5,"Discrimination for Black Widow I was really looking forward to watch this movie, especially for The Black Widow. But after watching it I can clearly see the discrimination done by Marvel if we compare with the Captain Marvel movie. Black widow was with the Marvel since Ironman 2. Appeared in Avengers franchise with some less notable contribution and footage. But when the character got chance to flourish herself Marvel pulled the chain again. In contrary, Captain Marvel got much better storyline than her. In my opinion this is a discrimination. The end of the story could really use some more logical actions."
935,9,"One last good ride with Nat Actually, I watched it the day it was out. I enjoyed the whole movie, a nice storyline, potent character connections. It just decently fitted between previous Marvel movies. Although, Nat could have been interpreted in much more depth and detail."
936,5,Thanks David Harbour to save the movie Terrible movie. Characters are uninteresting. Villain is pitiful. David Harbour with his role as Red Guardian made the watch more fun nevertheless.
937,5,We love Scarlett Johansson but... We love Scarlett Johansson but the story was not really impactful. The only thing that hyped us was the last fallen scene.
938,1,"This is a good example... ... on how to ruin a character... So, first of all, the movie lacked the faithfulllness to the comic... Then there's the choreography... So bad... very very bad... And the real Black Widow is a tough character, a violent one, not a ""family-friendly"" character... For me, this is a major letdown... but unfortunatelly, this is what happens when Disney buys Marvel or other superhero-labels... they completely destroy it."
939,6,"Unfortunately, They Have to Worry About the Bigger Picture Released: July 9th, 2021 Viewed: July 31st, 2021In the ever changing landscape that is Hollywood, no matter what kind of film you are doing, usually the results fall to ticket sales. So, if you are the MCU, you also have to look beyond the film itself and look ahead at franchise preservation. As you know 2019s Avengers: End Game (with an epilogue companion film in Spiderman: Far From Home - 2019), ended a three phase, 11 year, 24 film run, which ended in a critically acclaimed, fan supported, general audience box office smash. How do you top that? Well, for now, you don't.When accomplishing a feat that Kevin Feige was able to pull off, you need to understand your audience and fanbase well, which he does. In order to accomplish your success a second time you need to pull back and reign in your audience's expectations a little. You want to recreate that build up that made the first three phases so successful. That also includes tempering expectations for the audience. This is where things go off the rails for Black Widow (2021), when looking at it as a stand alone film. As part of a franchise, it does what it needs to do.Black Widow (2021), is meticulously and painfully crafted as a quiet entry in the MCU canon. As the first film of phase four, it tries not to dazzle or even really entertain, but more than anything else, it wants to tell the missing story of one of the Avengers' legendary characters. The film slowly begins the next Marvel saga off to a future, much bigger build up, over the next 10 years, which will hopefully dazzle us again, like Avengers: End Game (2019), did. It is the sacrifice that Black Widow (2021), has to do for the greater overall picture. As fun, enjoyable and pioneering that the first Ironman (2008), was, it still was mediocre fare by the time we got to End Game. Weather it was intentional or not, the early MCU build up from the early films, is what was needed for the overall spectacular event that happened at the end of the Infinity Saga.Now let's look at Black Widow (2021), on its own. Being as it is an established character, the legendary Black Widow/Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson), what we need to learn from the film, we do. In flashbacks we learn about Natasha's early childhood. We meet her pseudo-family, who are actually Russian spies, posing as her and her sister's (not related by blood), parents, who end up being on assignment a little too long and when the time comes for them to go home, the years have added way too many emotions and feelings to the girls psyche. So how do these assigned parents break free to return to the motherland without crushing the feelings and beliefs of their ""daughters"" Natasha and Yelena (Florence Pugh)?Intertwined between the flashbacks to the mid-1990s, was the time period that the Marvel fans really came to see. The film actually takes place in 2016 and contains the information that filled in the early missing years between Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Widow is on the run from the Sokovia Accords and after a few safe houses, she manages to track down her pseudo-family again in order to take down the Taskmaster and a handful of rogue Widows. We also get to learn more about the Red Room, the society that takes in the young women to be trained as Black Widows and what implications this life had on Natasha and Yelena. Their father is an aged, over-the-hill, ex-superhero himself, the Red Guardian (David Harbour), who is the Russian version of Captain America. Their mother is an original Black Widow (Rachel Weisz).The film accomplishes what it needed to at the expense of its own critical success. It needed to pay full attention to the character's history, her overall story arc and not worry about dazzle and flair. The film looks just as professional and polished as any other MCU film, it's just boring. I am giving this film a 6/10, which to me is still a good enough film to go see in the theaters. It should be seen in the theaters, because it does contain some big screen moments, it's just slow. As a Marvel fan I did not like the approach that they took with Taskmaster, but I'll let you decide if you care about that. It is important that the film paid homage to Natasha, considering what we know of her final fate. That feeling hangs over the film like a shroud though and may impact the overall quality of the film, because it might be that shroud that creates the overall feeling of an empty, dull script. Add in the fact that Scarlett Johansson is now suing Disney for streaming rights compensations just adds more to the shroud that seems to be hanging over this film. Did I mention the year and a half COVID delay on this film too? We probably needed more from the film and unfortunately the producers can't deliver that, because we have the overall picture to worry about.6.4 (D+ MyGrade) = 6 IMDB."
940,7,"Emotional Conscious, Funny, and So Marvel This movie is so good with characters. All of the ""family"" characters are So themselves. Seeing them adapt throughout the story is just *chefs kiss* The sisters dont have a mushy goodbye because they wouldnt do that. There were some cuts that felt not great and the plot was good sometimes and okay sometimes, but it was Enjoyable."
941,4,"You don't need the MCU for this X-M(CU)en, Winter Widows, Wasp & GNat.Just watch Tenet. Tenets a good movie. Yeah Tenet. Tenet."
942,6,"Overall good Movie was an overall well adapted sudo origin story for Widow. This movie had one huge glaring issue and that was taskmaster. The characters progression was unimaginative and truly nonexistent, you could take it out of the movie and replace it with well trained goons and it would honestly change nothing. Huge disservice to who the character is background wise in the comics and waste of a great reoccurring character."
943,7,"Not bad ... but not amazing either. When I saw a movie about Black Widow I thought that will be something more focused on her on the Avengers team maybe... but apparently the movie wanted to be something like her life story, similar with the Wonder Woman, but they honestly the movie was kind of meh... still, was good with lots of action and an interesting story .... but I feel like something was missing.They really had amazing potential with this movie and this character, but they kind of failed on delivery. Black Widow isnt my favourite superhero but still there could be a great movie about her. :("
944,5,Just 5 Just 5 for the endless boring dialogs. I almost slept during the scenes that had endless dialogs.I hope in next Marvel movie that will participate black widow or generally in next marvel movie they will reduce dramatically the dialogs.
945,4,"Really wanted to love this movie. Scarlet Johansson and Co. Really try to make this movie work. However, a weak story followed by even weaker, one-dimensional antagonists prove to be a great anchor in what otherwise could have been an excellent spy thriller.The acting is pretty great across the board (although Ray Winstone is the exception here), you can tell they are giving it their best. Florence Pugh steals the show as Yelena Bolova.The dialogue, while a bit campy at times, is good for the most part. There were only a couple times during the film that I cringed at an awkward interaction. ""The only resource this world has too much of...is girls"" bleghhhh.Here begins the fatal flaw of the film. While the pacing is somewhat in control, the story they are telling here is boring and by the numbers for a standard comic book. It has been quite some time since Marvel had a terrible villain but lo and behold Ray Winstone's performance as the villain (who I can't even remember the name of despite them saying it maybe a 10 times in the film) is up there with characters like Kaecilius or Whiplash. While he does challenge the morals of our protagonist, something most great Marvel villains do, it is given so little thought or time to explore that I found it rather insulting. He could've been do much more impactful on this story.There is also a complete tonal dissonance. I understand Marvel movies rely now more on their comedic aspects than their dramatic ones, but a healthy combination proves to be the most thought-provoking and memorable. Here, the film introduces humor at the worst of times, with many of the jokes seemingly throwaway that could have been replaced with more serious moments given the darker nature of this films plot.The story is nonsense, with really no resolution. I won't get into spoilers as I still think people should see it given they are a fan of Marvel's work but yeah, the story's end really felt like a cliffhanger with nowhere to go.Again if you are Marvel fan, go see this film, you might get a kick out of it. If you don't particularly care about Marvel films, you can skip this one.5/10."
946,3,"Boring very slow movie Girlish movie , all about family reunion , boring slow talks for many minutes .Whatever action for few minutes u see in trailer , that is all it has rest is chat chat chat and chat .As disappointing as age of ultron ."
947,5,"Middling Marvel Forgettable is the best word I can use to describe this movie. Marvel is a universe with marvels and misguided attempts (Capt Marvel), but this feel somewhere in between. The characters weren't engaging, the story meh, and action was mostly the same we've find to see. I didn't dislike it but will likely never give it another watch."
948,7,"Pretty good Maybe its a bit late in coming. But ""black widow"" is another decent movie from Marvel. If nothing new.It delves more into the background of the character. And the character Red guardian stands out in the movie. But it's really more about the action. And there is plenty of that. So it'll satisfy fans enough.I think the character could of been worked better if she was more realistic though. Here she's either swinging around like Spiderman or out running a greenscreen. But isn't she supose to be a mere human character? I supose this is how she's been portrayed so far so they had to keep going with it. But making her less of a superhero and more of a grounded fighter could of made things more interesting."
949,9,"Good movie Was expecting something more boring and was very surprised that I really enjoyed it. Good fighting scenes, conversations that made me laugh and I am looking forward to upcoming movies with that sister of Black Widow ...Is for sure not as bad as many comments suggest."
950,6,"It's just okay. They finally explain why Black Widow doesn't have a Russian accent in this. It would've been better to cast a Russian as her instead of ScarJo, though. She was never right for the part (I'm a fan, but this one is wrong for her). They could've gotten Russian actors for basically all the Russians in this movie, but they didn't and it didn't really work for any of them.There are too many times when she should've died or been seriously injured, but she gets away with barely a scratch. It pulled me out of the movie and made me feel like there were no stakes at all.The action was mostly good. Taskmaster got screwed up, though. Black Widow wasn't much of a main character.Overall, this felt more like a movie on TNT with a better FX budget."
951,7,Entertaining An entertaining movie.Remarkable how much the bad guy reminds me of Harvey Weinstein. Maybe that's just me.
952,3,Disney lost it! Welcome to Marvel phase bore! These fills like a story that didn't had to be told. A cash grab at best.
953,2,"Just a girl version of James Bond OMG, just watched the movie and it is just a girl version of James Bond."
954,10,"Finally a good female superhero film. I loved this film. After many disappointing female superhero films, I was nice to finally see a good one."
955,5,"Average Average movie dont keep high hopes, it was only good half way through, rest was very bad."
956,4,"From Tragedy to Sarcasm. Rinse and Repeat... The dialog is very uneven. Keeps swinging from serious tragedy to cheesy sarcasm. Too much CGI and indestructible characters. They missed their chance to create a serious, dark and disturbing MCU movie. Black Widow was the perfect subject. 2 catchphrases would have been enough. Filling the majority of the script with sarcasm gets old really fast..."
957,7,"Solid Addition Although the plot as a whole did not meet expectation, the newly introduced characters, along with Natasha, together constructed a family dynamic near unlike any other. Each protagonist stands out in their own light and each get their own chance to steal the show at least once. The action sequences and choreography were stunning and believable. Despite Taskmasters highly underwhelming debut Black Widow was/is another solid new addition to the MCU."
958,6,Average Just felt lack luster? Lost interest after a few minutes. Don't waste your time with the film you won't miss anything from the storyline. I don't recommend it.
959,3,👎👎 Total 'L' for Looser. Even Scarlett didn't look that great which is saying something. The plot was let's say hard to follow and made little sense. Spend your money elsewhere.
960,3,"Why black widow is a big regression for Marvel filmmaking and writing wise Black widow is a film that shows that Marvel doesn't have any merit sure the family dynamic is good and the comedy mostly lands but the thing is that when Natasha goes into her old safe house it's never shown visually that someone might be in there with her instead we are told, also the opening of the film is amazing it's so bold, raw and most importantly it feels real but then we go from there to Synthetic gas that can bring someone out of mind control and an Oder that can prevent violent action being done to the person what? Also this film has extremely bad CGI and the actors are weirdly photographed in a few scenes and this film didn't need so much CGI they could have shot in an actual field talking about the fight with taskmaster also the film is very afraid to delve into its themes and taskmaster became a one dimensional villain with a very deep connection to Natasha's past that is never focused on that much also by the end it's weird that all is forgiven by the end and I really do think Marvel should stop with third act explosion it's getting old do something new something fresh, Feige Get Filmmakers to express there visions instead of you calling the shots let them and stop giving us the same thing again and again and something that is one note and doesn't commit to it's themes and is one note."
961,8,"Worth the watch I'm not sure why so many people are saying it was boring or average. I'm assuming it's a bunch of nerds that aren't happy unless they see some magic or super powers. The fight scenes were very well done and it gave me a better understanding of Black Widow's history. I was entertained the whole time. Ignore the bad reviews and watch it if you like following the universe, which I do."
962,1,Extremely average There was nothing special about this film. Plot was predictable and ruined by wasted characters.It had potential but didn't deliver. Curious as to how they can release this film after a decade+ of ScarJo. No wonder she's suing Disney now.

964,10,Incredible A mixture of James Bond style incredible fight scenes and the darkest opening credits in mcu history. The cast is incredible. Easily a top five marvel movie for me possibly top three.
965,9,"Killing Black Widow In Endgame was A Huge Mistake. 😔 They could of made A Trilogy out of This Storyline They could of Easily made a Trilogy out of This about how Natasha and Yelena Were Trained as Kids to Adults to be Assassins and the the different missions they were doing before Natasha Defected. Such a Shame.Onto the Movie.The Fighting and Action was so Intense, my friends even said the time flew by because of how engaged we were.Things I personally liked:° The Fighting and Action was really satisfying, it's not Generic Action. It's really Impactful.° The Opening with Credits Was Great.° The Relationship between Natasha and Yelena was done really well.° The 'Family' Arch was Great Writing and it got Emotional with How It Went on as the Story Progressed.° Red Guardian was really good. Great Performance.° That Car chase scene was Amazing.° The Task Master was a very Intense Villain. Had Some Great Scenes.° The End Fight Between the Widows And Natasha was Done Really Well.° That Sky battle and the shooting and fighting in the Sky was Great to see.Some Criticisms are:° Would of Loved to see how Natasha and Yelena Were trained In the Red Room when they were kids a bit more in depth.° Main Villain Guy was a little weak.Overall, This Was An Excellent Movie, It was really well made."
966,5,Uninspired The lack of inspiration is visible from the beginning as the first scenes and the opening credits are a copy/tribute to the Americans TV Series. Rest of the movie features nice CGI/fights but then again uninspired as the only difference between the all women assassin team and a regular assassin team is to have women instead of men. I'm simplifying of course but widows could be replaced by widowers without major changes to the scripts.
967,6,"After the events of Civil War, Natasha Romanoff embarks on an unexpected adventure. Black Widow opens pretty good with a good opening sequence followed by some stealth style fight scenes. Things looked really good in the beginning but soon all the excitement starts to wash away by the end of first half. The major highlight of the movie are the opening credits with a good song which flashes through childhood of Natasha. Action sequences are the main thing to watch in the film which are watchable although they fail to be engaging. The movie has a good plot, some twists and a red room fight sequence which classify it to be a one time watchable action entertainer.Coming to cons,The cringe jokes were totally unnecessary and misplaced. The movie is plot driven rather than focussing on characters so most of them including the protagonist feels useless at times. Rachel Weisz and Scarlet are the only characters who somehow make their presence felt. Last but not the least the third act fight is the main factor that degrades the movie. The third act opened pretty neat but soon we are introduced to a over vfx-cgi driven sequence which only helped in reducing the effect of the movie. The post credits too felt degenerated which is unusual in MCU.In the end, Black Widow is a watchable movie from MCU but below par compared to usual MCU standard.Rating:62%"
968,9,"It was actually good! I like some marvel movies but usually get bored with just non stop action but this movie wasn't boring at all. It was mind blowing. Like I told my friends, it's crazy and awesome. Idk why people are hating on it but I think it's really good and intriguing. Go watch!"
969,4,"OK It's watchable, really has nothing memorable about it, but at least it wasn't an insult like so many current movies. Perhaps that in itself made it seem better."
970,6,"Black Widow Review It was a average movie , not really upto my expectations . The movie deals with some serious topics which are quite dark for MCU . So the execution of the dark part is kinda not comprehensive . The story seemed simple and a bit rushed . A lot of work could have been done with each of the characters . We really didn't connect with any of the characters except Natasha and Yelena. The world building could have been done with more depth making the users get immersed in the movie. Overall it's a good movie to watch as it has executed many aspects with perfection."
971,9,"If the main character was a man y'all wouldn't be complaining This movie was great, don't let any of these sour little boys try to convince you otherwise, much more entertaining and enjoyable than any captain America movie I've seen, all of these negative reviews are written by men who are used to every female character being written through the male gaze, great movie worth watching."
972,1,"Worst marvel movie This movies is pure garbage and I am a huge fan of marvel. This should have been release after civil war not now, and I am sorry to say the film falls flat. Don't believe the hype people are just scared to properly review a marvel film. Don't waste your time with the film you won't miss anything from the storyline. Just watch the last 5 minutes that's all you need."
973,7,"MCU Magic is Alive Again This isn't a solo gig for Nat, but Marvel seems best with an element of ensemble. The cast works well together, and each one of the family brings something good to the table with challenges to overcome. This isn't your straightforward heroes journey, but that's mostly because you have two heroes hitting the highlights.Sure, there's the could never in real life scenes, but this IS Marvel. In a world of soul stones and biology-altering serums, it's easy enough to put reality aside.The action shows how Widow went toe to toe with enhanced all these years. The setup for the Red Room will give MCU fans plenty to play with for years to come.My only real complaint is two spots where the music doesn't fit. It reminds me of the score from the second Matrix film: The was nothing technically wrong, but it stood out enough in an early motorcycle chase and part of the sky fall that I was distracted wondering why nobody changed that instead of paying attention to the eye-catching action.It's great to see more of SJ just being Natasha. Now with all of the age-shifting tech they've developed, they need to go back and do a Hawkeye + Black Widow TV spy serial.Last word? I never expected Budapest to look so nice. Maybe Hawk had the right attitude about that mission after all."
974,9,"Absolute surprise. I will consider Black Widow as one of the best Marvel movies ever produced. I went into the cinema expecting standard Avenger flick, and left god-smack as how mature, well-written and highly performed this movie was. From characters, to written plot; from fight scenes, to directing; from plot to great humour; from scenery to set designs. Every single box is a big fat tick. You do not even have to be a fan of the Avenger series, as the movie successfully stands on its own two feet. Yet, it also starts to suttlely place the foundation for next phase of the Avengers franchise. This movie was such a surprise. A 10 is usually reserve for my absolute favourite movies of all time, so a rating 9 is impressive."
975,10,Awesome 👌 movie Recommended to Watch Human 😆😆😆 Love the scene (Such a poser)
976,3,"Hot garbage I'm giving this a 3/10 because I liked the furniture and scenery in nearly all the shots. This is a really generous score all things considered.With the lazy story telling, bad acting and superfluous CGI, this is in fact not even worth a single star out of ten. The fake russian accents, not even worthy of John Milius' Red Dawn from 1980s, make this piece some of the most embarrassing and sloppy russophobic propaganda since the 60s.In 100 years of cinema, one would think that the art would evolve, not devolve. Sad to see.Don't waste your time."
977,2,"Black Widow... in white! They have no clue.Find one person at Disney/Marvel who understands comics, the characters, superheroes or Black Widow and I will show you an honest and ethical member of the Trump family.Seriously.As for all the fans and those upvoting this: you deserve this and it deserves you.Everyone else: go watch a Sherlock Holmes movie. It is like this, but it is good and has actors and actresses in it, something this film does not."
978,9,Loved it I absolutely loved this from start to finish.Great fight scenes.Great car chases.Fast paced and well acted. (just don't like Ray Winstone in anything)
979,1,"Lame It's just super lame, all actings, dialogues, scenes and so on... They are all great actors but a bad director could degrade all of them.I still don't understand why even two normal humans should be in Avengers between gods and super humans! I'm guessing to promote, but it's a lame act!This movie could be something like Captain America series, but they terribly failed.If you don't watch it, you won't miss anything."
980,6,Waiting and waiting for this After waiting a year now it has finally come black widow and was it good no first thing first I love taskmaster in the comics but in the movie taskmaster sucked literally it's not even a real villian just a brainwashed girl who is now good and it feels like Yelena and the dad steal the show it feels like it's not even about black widow. I don't think I'm gonna watch this again it's not that I hate it but I don't like it either.
981,7,"Solid This movie is OK; A solid 7/10. It feels like Captain Marvel. It is a Marvel movie that, neutered with a lack of a connection to the other characters we have grown to love and the future of The MCU. The acting is great; the team assembled in order to expand on The Black Widow methos should be infused in future movies. It is emotional, funny, and political. Human-trafficking is the major theme of this movie, and that lends it's self to the more serious scope of a 'Falcon and Winter Soldier,"" and how they chose to address racism in The USA. It feels drawn out and should have been more condensed. It would feel more action packed if that were the case. Overall, I can say you can't wait on this one."
982,1,not surprised This movie is trash poorly acted poorly shot poorly directed disney should be suing her !
983,1,"Worst in the MCU When I left the theater I was like ""huh, that was kinda fun"" but then I went home and thought about the movie for a few days, and the more I thought the worse it got. The characters are so wack, they just put people in the story because why not. This movie is good, if you don't think about it and if your not a Marvel fan."
984,7,"A marvel movie not needed The story was alright and easy to follow, however, i find myself watching an origin story that was 6-7 years too late. It provided no insight or adding more story to the whole marvel universe, besides possibly introducing 1-3 characters that may show up in future movies."
985,1,"Wish I could understand anything in this movie The sound mixing is so bad, so bass-heavy, that I can hardly understand any of the dialog. Its all blurred out by music and artificial sound effects.I wish Hollywood would stop this godawful practise."
986,10,"black widow review I've already watched the film twice, it's so good! Florence Pugh did a great job as Yelena <3."
987,7,"Enjoyable action film Not as good as alot of Marvel movies nit as bad as some. Little long in places but overall a good action movie. Yes I found it a little disappointing it seemed to focus more on her sister than her but she seemed like the stronger character anyway. If it came to a decision between Thor 2, Iron man 2 or this I'd choose this."
988,7,"Liked it but went downhill I found the first bit of the movie entertaining, the action is really in your face. Unfortunately it slides down into very obvious and generic scripts and twists.It's fine, but could have been so much better."
989,6,"Didn't meet the expectations. So, how're ya'll doing? I hope you're all doing great and watching outstanding movies and reading amazing books.So, recently Marvel's most awaited movie Black Widow released on the 9th July on Disney Plus and in theatres and as a self-certified Marvel geek I was too damn excited about this movie as it has been delaying for like a year, so it was the time for this movie to bust in, but to be honest it didn't meet my expectations. I was expecting something good and emotional. I'm not saying that there wasn't any action sequence, there was, but it felt like pushed-action. There wasn't for any need for that type of action.Back story wasn't that good either, I was expecting to feel connected with Nat's back story but that thing never happened. The story building wasn't good, the storyline felt a little boring, the action sequence wasn't that great. The only thing that I loved about the movie was Yelena. She was the only character in the movie that had some funny and humorous elements.So, for me this movie was a biggest disappointment. Well before this movie I only hated Thor: The dark world in the MCU but now I have my second most disappointed movie ever, i.e. Black Widow.For all my Marvel fans out there, this movie is not really the part of the MCU (according to me it was just a tribute to Black Widow's character and Scarlett Johansson) and if you are skipping it, then it's not much of a big deal, but you shouldn't miss the end credit scene as it's directly connected to Flacon and the winter soldier series and it will directly relate to Clint Barton aka Hawkeye in the upcoming Hawkeye series.So, that was all about this movie. If you want to watch it, then rock it on and if you're struggling with your work, then I'll recommend you shouldn't waste your precious time in this movie.To summarize, if you have time then watch it and if you don't, then it's better to skip it."
990,3,"Just an opinion on the overall movie Marvel movies are usually pretty entertaining to say the least. This one was very sub-par! It was DC-like. It was not written well, the humor was too awkward, and I just found that I could not be immersed in the movie like I do most Marvel movies. Red Guardian could have been the character that everyone loved, but that fell way short as well. I'm disappointed for the actors in this movie. This is the script & director's fault!"
991,1,"I don't write reviews generally but this movie forced me to.. Terrible - completely forgettable It's way below par for superhero movies.Below par for even an action movie.Very weak storyline and weaker storytelling.There was lots of name dropping from avengers, aimed at tying it back to the mega hit movies but sadly that works against the movie because you compare it to avengers and this looks way too cheap , messy and useless in comparison.Skip it is my advice .. never was a fan of black widow but started disliking her after this one. :("
992,8,"Of signature poses and awesome fights! Of signature poses and awesome fights!I love Black Widow and have been waiting for her to have her movie, a movie filled with her comebacks, wittiness, and action-packed. I wanted to know what happened in Budapest, what was the Red Room about, why she and Agent Barton share such a strong bond, what's her back story? Most of my questions went unanswered or were lightly threaded. Though if you're a fan, you'll love this anyway, if not, this won't draw you to the MCU. But man, am I pleased with Rachel Weiz, it's been 20 years but Evelyn from The Mummy hasn't aged a day. Florence Pugh too is great at her character but was David Harbour required? Or was that man a weird filler of sorts?The movie doesn't live up to the MCU, especially when the last one we watched was Avengers Endgame. Natasha Romanoff deserved better."
993,5,"Fine, but could be better. It's fine. The VFX are the first problem, the ending looks pretty bad. The fire effects are strangely orange, don't know if that's a stylistic choice, an accident or just plain bad. Costumes are well designed with the exception of Taskmaster, who looks like a walking Nerf gun. Johanssen feels strangely out of place in the film, which has a lot to do with the fact that they shelved her to make way for her sister. Pugh does a great job, with a not so great script. The comedy in the script gets out of hand as comedy and jokes appear at bad times. It's as if a boardroom made this film at times. For a film with what Marvel described as more real and visceral action, this film does not deliver on that promise. The car being shot down the street in Budapest was ridiculous. Also, the entire ending.Well shot, well acted and the characters are all interesting int heir own rights."
994,8,As expected I enjoyed the film. What can we expect from a Marvel movie? Not much. Especially from the black widow which she is not an Avenger with a very strong character.The story is acceptable and enjoyable. I really didn't expect much from this film.
995,2,"Is this movie on black widow wtf?? Scarlett looks like a background actor,seems like Florence Pugh is the main character lolzz."
996,10,"Awesome Empowering Movie! I don't usually write reviews, but this movie was so unique it absolutely warranted a review. All of the female characters (and there were plenty) were engaging. This movie needs to be seen. It passes the Bechdel Test with flying colors! Wake up, Hollywood.At a time when female leads (whose characters aren't somehow attached to a male character) are ridiculously rare, this movie delivers. Full Stop! It pushes the boundaries of your typical action ""blockbuster"" like no other movie. It's a movie that will empower women and girls alike. Hollywood should be showing more of this; Hero's DO come in all genders. It's high time to start reflecting that - like this movie does."
997,6,Doesnt feel like Marvel This movie feels so seperated from the Mcu that for me it was hard to see it as a marvel movie. Its just an action movie without the Marvel Flair.
998,8,"Not great but still the best female superhero movie yet So, ""the best female superhero movie yet""? Yes, but that isn't a high bar. The first Wonder Woman was the only OK one so far and even that had a terrible second half.Black Widow is a competent action film with a decent plot, some fun characters, OK jokes and very well done action sequences. It isn't on par with the best in the MCU. The main problem is that Black Widows back story is given too little focus and that makes the villain forgettable and makes the whole affair a bit shallow. I think the director wanted to avoid it being too dark knowing where it ends, but that was a mistake. As it stands the jokes come across as a bit odd because we understand the underlying darkness but we haven't explored it. If we were given the full story I believe the humor would have been the gallows humor that feels appropriate for people who have been so abused. That could have been one of the best MCU movies ever."
999,5,"It's embarrassing how this story is boring. It's like someone else here said: I was watching some CGI and the then someone show up!Is there any one really writing this?I think from now on, I will just stop watching Marvel."
1000,2,"So slow This movie is incredibly slow, half the movie is dialogues that are not even worth it and the other half is just ""meh"" action scenes. Pretty boring movie altogether."
1001,7,"Didnt want to watch it after the reviews but I was quite suprised, I enjoyed it! I think some movie reviewers are a bit too harsh on this movie because one for enjoyed it. Itsnot the best and it is not up to par with the Winter soilder and Civil war etc but it was still good. Its a movie to just enjoy and not to take too seriously."
1002,1,"Waste of time Such lame FX and too much CGI. Even the so called ""emotional moments"" were boring. In the pursuit of making a ""woman mostly movie"", they disregard a lot common sense logic. One of SJ worst movies. I believe she should just retire."
1003,2,"total crap Boring as hell and totally 100% predictable! I mean it was bad, who ever wrote this needs $#@! Canned immediately!"
1004,2,"My boyfriend made me watch this and he fell asleep mid-movie Imagine my surprise watching this Marvel film right after watching Loki. It would less painful to watch Grey's Anatomy s16e11.No plot, lame and unrealistic action, cringeworthy lines & lots of unnecessary drama.Very disappointed in Marvel. You guys need to respect your audience.Do urself a favour and skip this."
1005,8,"A pointless, but good movie This is a solid and good movie. Did the movie have much of an importance? No. Is it worth watching and will you have a good time? Yes."
1006,2,"How can this movie be so blah? It has Scarlett Johansson, a bunch of other great women, a thousand writers and it sucks. The plot is so thin and nothing is based on cause and effect, it's more like, ""oh we need to justify this incredibly oblique polite point so let's throw this exposition in now."" Seriously, this is what counts as a Marvel movie now? I guess there are no more great Marvel movies."
1007,9,"Was amazing Didn't notice how 2 hours have passed. I loved Natasha's story and the humour of the movie, also packed with action and great acting. Only wish for a sequel if they could! Best Marvel individual film."
1008,1,"Disney should sue HER for how BAD she is in this AND the avengers films!!!! Scarlett SUCKED as black widow!!! I'm only giving it 1 star because of the co star otherwise it deserves a zero I know I cant give a zero but it's a definite zero film. Scarlett was just off in this boring film and I'm glad shes not doing marvel films anymore because shes the weakest link in them. Not sure if it's the quality of the other actors or that shes just bad as black widow. I loved her in Lucy but here she has no personality no screen presence, and a super heroe NEEDS presence. That's what's so ironic about her suing Disney, when she got paid 2 much already!! This movie is and always will be a Terd, a real life BOMB the worst marvel movie BY FAR!!!! Scarlett it's time to retire!! I think she knows it's all over so trying to get her last pay check!!"
1009,10,"Loved it Loved it! Exactly what I hoped it would be, didn't disappoint!"
1010,9,Marvelous Great tribute for black widow. It made me cry . It made me smile. Overall I loved it. Florence and Scarlett has done fabulous job.i am keen to see more of Yelena in mcu. I don't know why so much hate . I absolutely love it.
1011,9,"Amazing woman focused film, which is way it's got such a low rating i expect Definitely ignore most of the comments left by men who are annoyed by the fact that this film is from the female gaze rather than the male gaze. I can almost garuntee if she wore less clothes and was most suggestive then there would be higher ratings from males.I think the film was amazing but can it be classed as a superhero film when the protagonist doesn't have any super powers? Black Widow is an amazing character and i think people are hating on the movie as they're forgetting that she's just a normal human. Scarlett and Florence were an amazing duo and really brought the film together. Probably my second favourite Marvel film to date. I do think the plot could have focused a bit more on Natasha but that's probably my only complaint."
1012,2,"Could do a lot better It's an ego trip for Johansson as CGI does all the work and no acting required. It's a leg up in Hollywood for Pugh. But, really, 134 minutes? Really? I don't think so."
1013,2,"It Could Have Been Worse It could have been worse. Not much. The story line was choppy. The bad guy had no character, just your generic ""I'll do anything to rule the world"" guy. Stan is over in his grave. Lots of action, good actors, that's about it."
1014,3,"Worst MCU movie so far To begin - I've never been a fan of Black Widow but I tried to keep an open mind when watching this movie. First - the chase/fight scenes were numerous and went on far too long. That's ok for the final battle but the ones leading up to it should have been edited for maximum impact. I found myself not caring at all about the outcome of each.Second - no, wait, still the first point - because of the numerous fight scenes there was little room for a true exploration of the family dynamic and the bonds that existed.This movie does not stack up to the other MCU movies and does not bear repeat viewing."
1015,6,Disappointing ending There was too much in the movie to give enough screen time to it all but the action is always good.
1016,8,"Great movie with undeserved hate I dont really know why so many people seem to have a problem with this movie, i mean it definetly wasnt the best marvel movie ever made but not every movie can be the best movie ever. I do agree that taskmaster was kind of disapointing especially since in the trailer and movie he was made out to be this amazing villian. However i really enjoyed all of the family scenes and Yelena and Natasha's relationship and scenes. I also thought both Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh gave an amazing preformance and I dont think Yelena necessarily took the spotlight (it felt more like a shared movie but more from Natashas perspective). CGI was really good and the Budapest story was....definetly not what i expected. I do think Natasha was a bit op in this movie but the fight scenes were still really cool! Overall not the best marvel movie but a great one!"
1017,10,"Loved it Good fun, great acting, great film. Don't understand the bad reviews."
1018,2,"A bit disappointing... The end of Avengers franchise? I don't understand how this movie got 6.9/10.. It's a very very average movie, boring like hell! Scarlett has like only 2 lines to say, and the rest is done by a stunt double.. Her 'sister' and 'father' are performing all the action and are really great!! Oscar for them!! About Scarlett, she shouldn't make a claim to get extra cash from Disney, because she wasn't that much in the movie, looking at real screen time, and she didn't perform any stunt.. It was even at that level it got very annoying, her stunt double jumps, cut, action, close up on face of Scarlett.. Come on guys, really.. We are in 2021, not 1980's.. If I want this kind of action, I rather watch a movie with Steven Seagal.. same style of movies."
1019,8,"Good addition to Marvel Universe I enjoyed the movie. Good characters and character development, action sequences, effects, pacing and world building.More than one good twist.A bit darker than other Marvel movies, so probably not good for younger audiences.An exciting ride that keeps you guessing.Scarlet was excellent - good luck with the lawsuit!!"
1020,1,"Another pointless storyless marvel garbage I do understand the high ratings, 6.9 at the moment when i am writing this on the first day of august 2021. They were written by 10 years old kids who are used by hollywood to show them these plotless cgi pithole movies so they no longer need to read comics any more. They could be amazed easily with the effects and constant explosions and loud noises that these type of movies produce. They don't understand the world yet as this is their only experience and they never will unless some responsible parents push the off button on the tv and tells them to rather read a nice story and imagine the world and characters in it by themselves. I wish the good old days could come back and so does sense, story, drama and reality (even sci-fi) into movies.Also there is no reason for a spoiler alert button. There is no story. I couldn't have spoiled anything even if I wanted too..."
1021,2,"Meh! I never thought I'd say this about Marvel movie, but ""meh."" It just didn't come together, and not due to the talent as I've seen most of these actors in other roles where they were very good, but this just didn't work.The acting felt forced as did some of the action & story. A waste of time and $$$.Some parts were downright boring, especially with the heavy accents and depressing ""Russian"" back story & dialogue where I almost fell asleep. Hannah, Red Sparrow, or Anna as female assassin film were better, and worked, this didn't.One more thing, what's with the costume changes, it's like either you wear regular clothes or you have a uniform, but to have different uniforms for every other or different scenes or parts of the movie?It was the same with the unlimited supply of vehicles, like are these stolen or do you just rent them or what, out of nowhere?The devil is in the details, however the movie seemed like a copy of bits and pieces of the previous movies without detail, or a bad Bond film without any charisma.Not worth a 2nd viewing unlike all previous Marvel movies, this was barely worth a single.Oh, and the teaser at the end was just sad!"
1022,8,"Fun MCU movie but way too late The only thing that sucks about this movie is that it's way too late. We all know how Natasha is going to end, why didn't they immediately produce this before Endgame?What sets Black Widow apart from other MCU movies is the funny family dynamics. Natasha and Yelena are the perfect pair of sisters, and the Red Guardian is just hilarious. Their humor is pitch black as it should be for child assassins. Can't wait to see more of Yelena.We get a look behind the curtain what Black Widow does in her free time. Why didn't we get this earlier?Other than that, the movie gives you the typical MCU action and you won't be disappointed. But why did this take so long?"
1023,1,Marvel could've done better After a huge movie like endgame this one is unnecessary and who asked this one . Marvel could've done a better job than this one pov thor 1 was amazing than this one.
1024,1,Don't waste your money They should have just made it mini series. That was not boring.
1025,6,"Not as Deadly as Hoped for The widow's backstory is interesting, but the film lacks the bombastic heroics I was waiting for. She's gotta free up all the other widows, and it all plays out in a regular fashion."
1026,10,"Way better than I was expecting Black widow is one of my least favorite avengers, so I was not expecting too much from this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised by the storyline, action, and acting."
1027,8,"How Fun! I saw all the low ratings and so I went into the movie with very low expectations, but I am so glad I was wrong to doubt. Sure Natasha was not the only one on screen, and sure the cgi was a lot, but somehow it was really comforting. I have been waiting for this movie as an avid black widow fangirl, so I was really glad that I got the back story that I have been waiting for for so long. Compared to other Marvel movies, this movie doesn't focus on one main person who is extremely set out of becoming hero, this movie focuses on the family, the split, the relationship between the sisters. And that's the reason I rate it so high, because it was such a peaceful movie in midst all the fights and all! The story/plot was a bit weak so that's the reason I took of 2 points. Other than that, I would deff watch again just for the fun of it:)))"
1028,1,"Utter garbage Don't waste your time watching this nonsense. No story, all CGI, no acting, no entertainment. Drivel. Watch something else."
1029,8,"Really liked the first half! The intro for this movie may be the best one yet in mcu history.Overall great acting, good cgi, good music. But the second half was not as good as the start unfortunately."
1030,1,"Boring We got bored, so we ended up watching the tv screensaver instead, it was of the ocean, very relaxing, can't complain, now it's mountains. Have a nice day."
1031,9,"For Me It's Go Big or Go Home. This One Went Big..... I'm sorry, but I loved this movie. After reading all the whining, negative reviews, I was blown away by how enjoyable it was. A lot of people seemed to take offense that Natasha Romanoff was too tough, too powerful . Not me. That's why I pay money to go watch movies on the big screen--to be wowed, to be surprised, to watch the heros of the show kick serious butt. (If a favorite sports team has won 12 games in a row do fans whine that they're TOO GOOD, and they wish they would lose a few to make it more interesting? Hell no. You NEVER hear that. Why should cinematic heros be any different?) Great action, great CGI (mostly), good story, lots of humor, big production values, good acting. Of course it wasn't perfect. Spoiler alert: There was a 15 minute family reunion type event in the middle that was too long and too sappy. If I had known it was coming I could have used it for a bathroom and snack bar break. Other than that, for me it was an awesome movie. 8-1/2 stars out of 10.PS: I liked Captain Marvel too."
1032,6,"Review in pills - Black Widow PRO:one of the best incipits and first parts of the whole MCU;in-depth insight into the character of Natasha and the narrative strand connected to her: huge pity not to have developed it before (not necessarily with a film, but through a TV series) because the whole story of espionage and her pre-Avengers would have had a enormous potential (so much so that it can create a separate narrative arc connected, but not focused on superheroes);photography and visual look: good;movie that entertains: it does better than many other MCU movies;first small reference of a link with the series: post-credit scene that binds to Falcon & the Winter Soldier.CONS:VOTE: 6.5 Although appreciated more than many other MCU films due to constant postponements, the film seemed old compared to the phase and type of storytelling Marvel would be in (as the same would seem from the trailers for the Shang-Chi film (happy to wrong)) and this would inevitably lead to a low level of interest in the film."
1033,7,Good entertainment Good film with a perfectly ok story line why the women are overrepresentative in the film. But what gets on my nerves is why they have Olga in the role of Taskmaster when stunt doubles are men and it shows. They should just cast a man in the roll to begin with.
1034,6,"Great action, great new characters, plot was a throw away This movie was a good stand alone for Natasha and had its amazing action pieces. Honestly I loved the family dinamic they put in there especially yelana and I quite enjoyed all the back and forth with the family aspect. Great performance by the villain but it falls short in the third act with a cliché plot twist and underwhelming stakes that don't really put you on the edge of your seat.In conclusion the first act had me gripped and fully engaged the second act was very fun and had lots of growth in character for the family and natasha, but the third act was as I said underwhelming and quit honestly rushed. Overall a good marvel movie but not there best."
1035,8,"Really fun This was a really good film in the cinema. As it set in between Captain America Civil War and Avengers Infinity War, it would probably have made more sense to have made this film prior to Infinity war, however a really good watch. Great characters and made me laugh several times."
1036,9,"One of the better Marvel Movies I really don't understand why they didn't make this movie years ago in Phase 1.I honestly loved it. I loved having Scarlett as the main character and Florence, Rachel and David did a great job supporting. The storyline was simple but effective and there some great fight scenes.Some YouTube reviews I had seen weren't a fan of the movie but I honestly don't know what they were expecting. It was fun, full of action, good acting and didn't overdo it. Pity there won't be anymore Scarlett as Black Widow as I would be happy to see a sequel. Hoping not what they ended it with though. That is one movie I wouldn't watch. Don't overdo it Marvel you are pushing things too far."
1037,7,OK movie.........not a great movie; which you might expect from marvel after avenger(s) series OK movie.........not a great movie; which you might expect from marvel after avenger(s) series I am giving it 7 stars....... 5 star = movie 1 star = scarlett johanson 😍 #crush 1 star = Florance 😍 she is cute 😂 and there ass was in fire where the hell none from avenger arrived earlier 😂😂
1038,2,Another piece of trash cashing in on the Marvel franchise. Don't waste time. I can't even be bothered wasting time going into why this is so bad.
1039,8,"Give it a Shot! Yeah, it might be more gritty and dark than most Marvel movies, but it keeps it fresh. It's different and exciting. Surprisingly funny, too, especially Yelena and Red Guardian. The beginning was a bit slow, but it starts to pick up later. I just wish this would've been put out before the character was dead."
1040,7,Overhated It's nowhere near a great movie. But it's not a bad movie.
1041,5,"The Cast had great potential... But the majority of the performances were sub-par, the russian accents were badly done and not convincing at all mainly because of the out of place Dad jokes and idiotic humor thrown into the gears. Out of all the marvel movies this has got to be by far the worst.. Do not recommend, even for her backstory it ain't worth it.."
1042,10,"Probably the best MCU movie to date Well developed lead characters, great action, and good plot. Scarlet Johansson and Florence Pugh have great chemistry whenever they are on screen together. I'm only sorry that we won't be seeing the Black Widow character in future."
1043,1,"Bad Movie Worst movie of marvel that I saw, stop watching the movie at minute 120, so sarcasm, filler and joke that does not make you laugh."
1044,3,"Don't waste your time 3/10 Another one of Hollywood's pathetic nonsense. Cheap script, cardboard dialogues, exhausted actors and tons of expensive computer graphics. Every next step is so predictable that it's jaw-droppingly boring. Do yourself a favor - spend those two hours on something more important in your life. Don't thank me."
1045,5,"Black Widow in a white outfit? I have only watched this once so far.Of course, she dies in the end - well, she died in Avengers: Endgame.Why the white outfit?I think her sidekick will live on in a sequel or two, no?"
1046,8,"UNDERRATED MOVIE I had such a great time with black widow. Yes, the taskmaster reveal was disappointing, but other than that, the acting is great, the visuals are great, the fight scenes are great, and the red guardian stands out in this movie."
1047,6,"Meh Found it very boring. Usually can follow movies but this one just dragged on and couldn't keep my attention, which is a surprise because action is my favourite genre. A lot of family drama too which took away from the movie in my opinion."
1048,7,"Needed more Ray Winstone I'm writing this very quick review from someone that isn't a big MCU fanboy. I like marvel films don't get me wrong, but I just watch the ones I like the look of and want to be simply entertained by it. And to be honest it was a decent watch. It has flaws don't get me wrong, but I feel the rating is a little low here.So my issue is the title. We needed more Ray Winstone. He did his role brilliantly, as per. But he's barely in it. He's there for the final stage of the film and that's it. Considering he's the main villain, he just wasn't there enough. It seemed like the director wasn't too sure who should be the villain. Him or the daughter. So it was just combined, but not done overly well.I have to say as well, considering it's called Black Widow. The star of the show is Florence Pugh. She did her role so well and really carried this film. She was the one I was really rooting for throughout, really good character to get behind.Other than that though, the plot is okay. It's not going to blow your socks off, but it's still an entertaining watch. And the characters are fun and have good arcs to get involved in. So yeah, overall I enjoyed this watch."
1049,3,"So Many Plot Holes Technically speaking Black Widow is poorly directed. The action sequences don't flow and are often visually confusing.Regarding the writing, it's predictable, formulaic and contrived with flat characterizations and many uses of deus ex machina.Important characters are not true to their original comic book counterparts.Overall a disappointing movie clearly made by committee."
1050,1,"Baaaaaaaaaaaaad Title of my review says it all. A complete waste of time, talent,and celluloid. Enough of these comic book 'movies' already! If you've seen one,.............."
1051,1,"Very boring Very bad movie , please don't watch it doesn't deserve the cinema ticket value 👎👎💸💔"
1052,8,"Enjoyable and disappointing I like this movie, it's fun, great action and it's easy to follow. But Black Widow deserves SO much more. Natasha has been in the MCU from pretty much the beginning and her own movie is well overdue. This was marvels chance to do something dark, moody and mysterious. Instead we got an action movie that we've seen before. Black Widows background is as dark and grim as it gets and the red room is supposed to be one of the most haunting places that you can find. I love Black Widow and her own movie could have easily become my favourite in the MCU, but instead, we got this."
1053,4,Disappointed..Boring..Exception: Pugh!! The movie is more like a compilation of different scenes from unrelated flop movies which has unenthusiastic actors. But Only one exception is Pugh though..Somehow her character and the way she presented it to the screen is outperforming all the other things in the movie. Anyway is black widow can be seen in the movie? Or i have to use some kind of special goggles?
1054,7,A Tick List Humour - Yes Action - Yes Good Fight Scenes - Yes Entertaining Plot - Yes Beautiful Scarlett Johansson - Definitely YesDon't know why there are so many haters!!?
1055,4,2014 movie for 2021 Should of been a 2014 Movie . An origin story that should of been done way before. I don't think Black widow is a big enough character to get her own movie. Felt stretched and needed a lot of supportive characters for it to even be a marvel movie. What's up the Bourne identity camera work? Not fitting!
1056,7,"Pugh-ny Humans After such a long time since ""Far from home"" and with only a semi constant stream of excellent TV to keep us going, finally the long delayed ""Black Widow"" solo movie is released at the cinema (and on Disney Plus). Was it worth it.... Just about, but it definitely feels like a lesser entry into the MCU.On the run having participate in breaking the Sokovia accords with Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is in hiding. This is broken when a package reaches her from a former safe house, that makes her a target for Taskmaster, a villain capable of copying and besting the fighting style of any opponent. Her investigation into the package brings her back into contact with Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) another trained assassin who once operated as her sister on a lengthy undercover operation. Together the pair investigate whether the fabled Red Room operation is still taking place, or whether it died with Dreykov (Ray Winstone) on a mission in Budapest several years earlier.I suppose, for me, the problem with ""Black Widow"" is not so much that the film itself does anything wrong, it's more than it feels a touch below the obscenely high standards that Marvel have set for themselves in the last few years. Performances are good, visual effects are great. I've always really liked Florence Pugh and I hope that the MCU will run with her for a while, as the post credits scene suggests they will.I didn't care as much for some of the action scenes as I have in other Marvel films. . . There appeared to be a regression back to that shaky cam/Bourne style fights where there is lots of movement and not a great deal of logic. But mostly my problem was that the story was just standard. I'd have liked it to be a more of a spy thriller and not just another, I'll get captured by the villain and sort my problems from there plot.Again, it's not a bad film, not by any stretch, but relatively to the best films in the MCU, ""Winter's Soldier"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Ragnarok"" it's definitely less than."
1057,10,"LOVED THIS FILM!!! AMAZING CAST! This was a masterpiece of pure emotion, and an enjoyable thrill-ride that did not disappoint. The cast-chemistry was 100% incredible!"
1058,4,"It's falling down (marvel movies) Really Marvel's movies become wasting time. Also, doesn't make sense in the scenes in movie. These things happen alot in super heroes they have over emotional. Specially in family reunion, they are professional in their job as assassins or fighters and you will find them suddenly have over emotion and start crying. We find betrayals in these movies a lot such as Natasha's mother she works for Red Room and when she met her family. Also, there are so much vulgar jokes like (you welcome). There are underestimation and manipulating the mind of the viewer. I have a lot of points in this movie shows the move loss the quality in world cinema."
1059,1,"Marvel is finished Awful, awful, awful movie. When my two daughters, who are marvel fans, especially of the female characters, ask me to turn this movie off then you know how bad it is!!"
1060,10,"Best Women Marvel Film Just very beautiful like every Marvel movie so far, I'm a big fan of Marvel movies. In the end it was a bit sad until this woman came and screwed everything up but was very funny and beautiful. 10/10."
1061,7,"Think for yourselves, don't be sheep... First of all, Stephen Dorff can suck it. He made a commit that he felt sorry for Scarlett making this movie. After watching the film, he comes off as a jealous, bitter actor with no job prospects. Now, on to the movie. It's not as high impact, in your face like the other Marvel films. You have to remember, this is a background story. We learn about Scarlett's character and what led her to become an Avenger. There's lots of action, a bit of whit, a bit of family drama, lots of insight about how she grew up and what she went through. I really enjoyed this film and I'm glad I watched it instead of heeding the negative reviews."
1062,1,Horrible and boring If it was not the pandemic I would have stopped the movie after first 20 minutes. Total garbage.
1063,2,"Mediocre at best There's not much for me to say that other reviewers haven't already said. I've read a lot of great reviews with in-depth details about this movie. Scarlet is the sidekick in her OWN movie, lol! That really sums up why you should wait to see this for free or until October when Disney releases this on their streaming platform. Unfortunately the delays ruined whatever chance this had at being a hit."
1064,8,"I'm Shocked How Much I Liked It I went into this movie having read the reviews and I had very low expectations. I think the reason I liked this movie is that I'm not at all a fan of the newer MCU movies.I am, or was, a fan of super-hero movies. I think the best era was 2000 - 2012. I loved the first two X-Men, the Sam Raimi Spider-Man, the Nolan Trilogy, the first Iron Man & Captain America movies from Marvel Studios.Around the time that the first Avengers movie came out is when I started to think the MCU movies were going downhill fast. The DC movies were no better but I'm only going to talk about Marvel for obvious reasons. They turned into mindless CGI team mash-ups with no character development, no back story and way too many cheesy & unfunny one liners. I honestly started to wonder why these movies kept making money at all.Black Widow feels like a return to the style of super-hero movie that I enjoy. It had back story, character development, characters pursuing real values rather than just ""good vs evil"" with endless drawn-out boring CGI action sequences. The humour was mostly well placed. The action sequences, while over the top at the climax, were actually enjoyable throughout the film since they furthered the plot and didn't drag on too long. A lot of the action reminded me of The Bourne Identity films which I loved.I can't believe that Marvel managed to put out a film that I absolutely loved after a decade of mediocrity but here it is alas. Great job."
1065,8,Good fun Never read comic books so don't know much about back stories but this movie was fun. It was interesting and great to see this take on how Black Widow became who she is. Also enjoyed the family aspect.These movies aren't made to be deep or thought provoking and if you want to just be entertained for a couple hours and have fun I recommend it.
1066,10,LOVED.IT. Really love it- love a superhero movie where the main character does not have any supernatural of special abilities and have to do everything based on skill. This film also helps us understand the attachment Natasha has to the Avengers and her connection to them. LOVE her sister and the entire family- their dynamics are fun and great comic relief. Love the stunts and special effects. And love being able to FINALLY see myself in a movie. But Marvel - plz. Let my girl to her thing in flats. Plz.
1067,3,"Not really a film, but rather a soulless corporate Disney CGI compilation It seems that following the success of Captain Marvel, Disney decided to make another female-lead Marvel film (because Disney cares about feminism and social justice, just like they care about Tibet and Xinjiang).There was of course potential to make a good film, but they didn't even try. It was just CGI without any substantive plot. It was almost like watching a John Wick film, except this film was unironically being so shallow. The script itself was also hollow, dry and forgettable - conversations between characters felt forced and were either used to inform the audience of information in a very artificial tasting way, or to just be filler for this hollow corporate production to take up the film's timeslot, so that Disney could eventually cut to the chase of selling merchandise.But hey, we need to still respect this film because they sorta made it about women being strong and standing up against the only two/three forgettable main male characters in the ""story"", right? Well, no, this isn't a substitute for actually having a storyline. The real question we should take away from this film is whether it will take two months or two weeks for people to forget about it."
1068,7,"At the brink of the perfect Black Widow's send-off. A fun action blockbuster but one that perhaps wasn't needed this time With a gripping, thrilling and even darkish opening; and following with a swift but effective Black Widow backstory development; the film felt like it was going to be the origin story we wanted to see of her without actually being an origin story.And so it was. I was on board with ""going after the big bad guy"" main plot and the family development that ensues. Because from the trailer I knew those were going to be the themes. However, i was pleasantly surprised by the execution. I was expecting a cliched, average Marvel Captain America and the Winter Soldier-like spy-action movie, but in turn i was treated with, well sort of that same thing but with surprisingly more things to offer.The filmmaking felt different from other marvel spy-action movie. The action sequences were actually trying something other than quick cuts and weight-less jumping (not that there wasn't any, but there are always because it's a superhero movie so what'd you expect?). And the characterisation of not only Natasha but the rest (although slight, enough to be captivating) of the 'main charcters' was engaging enough to keep you wanting to know more about how their stories develop.Perhaps it was because I went in knowing it wouldn't be a game-changer, that it was going to be just that fun blockbuster action movie with strong female characters and easy quippy jokes. So i went in with a certain mindset that was changed immediately when the opening credits kicked in. I thought 'woah, maybe they will get a bit more mature', because that is sort of how her backstory was introduced as in the first Avengers and followed up in Ultron. This dark past, where she did horrible things she was trying to make amends of. A secret russian assassin school that did horrible things to her and turned her into a weapon, sort of like the darker story with the Winter Soldier program in terms of tone. However, I must say as the story progressed I was beginning to understand they weren't aiming for that sort of story and rather a more heist-like mission impossible action thrill-ride with cliched villains and a happy ending. I just would have liked more of the assassin than the spy angle, more John Wick and Winter Soldier-Russo angle than the action-hero time.IN CONCLUSION, I truly enjoyed the movie, it was a great popcorn cinema experience. But maybe it's because I haven't seen many new game-changing releases lately so watching a movie that presented those well known tropes and characterizations properly and cohesively made me value this movie higher than it actually is in the great scope of things. It's okay to love this movie, to consider it one of the greatest of Marvel. But we have had already twenty somethings of these and the movies have gotten better with time so seeing how some turn out to be just easy-blockbuster movies, becoming just good movies when they could have been great ones. Marvel should not be afraid of getting creative and risking their franchises. I personally would have loved if Natasha's send-off movie would have been a more bleaker and even dramatic take at Natasha's past just to end the movie with a crescendo of heroism, ""blaze of glory""-ending type. Which is and always has been her actual story, she was in a bad bad place, doing bad things until she said 'enough', found her calling at SHIELD, who gave her a second chance and found a family in the Avengers. A group of misfits, just like her, with whom she'd fight the battles others couldn't. I just personally wished the movie was more about Natasha and less about yet another world dominating plot which started and ended here."
1069,6,"its alright This movie was decent enough, the acting was good, the fight scenes were decent, the movie just doesn't reach the heights that it could have. It does alot of things right but just enough to make it by. This had the vibe of a mission impossible type movie, slightly above average, decent, but nothing i got to excited over."
1070,5,"Barely average I was really disappointed by the movie because I was having high hopes as I like Marvel movies in general. But this movie felt more like a DC movie: Oddly paced, the story felt like they don't know where to go with it and the special effects were rather pointless.I rate the movie 5/10 because it's barely average compared to other action/Marvel movies. Overall very disappointing. I would even consider WW84 a better movie than this one."
1071,7,"It's a great movie, but should have been release after civil war I am a big fan of Marvel movies and I have watched them all several times. In short, does this movie do black widow justice? No. And how could it? This is basically an origin movie to a side kick character that we already know dies... If this movie was launched when it should have... After Civil War, the impact would have been much different. And this is how I took it. I saw this movie, as if she was still alive in MCU, and this was a representation of what Natasha has always been... A support, a rock to anyone fighting beside her, while she struggles to make right for her past. Except that in this movie.. she finally does ( and we finally know what happened in Budapest). I think this is why so many take it as if she is the sidekick. Also, I wont lie, this movie is meant to give us a ""replacement"" to black widow. But Yelena is a badass and will be very exciting to see. Still the fighting/action scenes are quite nice. People are complaining but let's be honest.. weren't many Marvel movies predictable? CGI heavy?? Finally, the complaints about the villain... This villain isn't meant to transpire outside this single movie... People are asking Loki level.. Thanos level villains.. are you crazy?? You dont put a villain that literally required the Avengers to be formed, or reborned.. in comparisson to a simple human-villain, that in fact exists (which makes people just generally uncomfortable, unlike an alien villain-human trafficking is the no 1 business in the world and most are girls). At the end, the movie is great, it just gives us more of Natasha being Natasha, it gives us a release to know that she was loved by a family before the Avengers, it gives us fun action and a bit of that Marvel comedy sequences. She would've deserved this movie after civil war and a proper send off with a sequel but alas... Female hero movies are still an uphill battle. NOTHING to do with Wonder Women 2 (that was an embarrassment)"
1072,5,Just an ok action movie I guess I really didn't get it. Why did she get and or need her own movie? It really didn't do anything for the mcu in my opinion. Go in with low expectations and you may enjoy it..
1073,5,"Mediocre... This movie has unrealistic action scenes.. Even for a marvel movie. Sometimes it's so ridiculous it puts you out of the mood.. That was the main problem..second thing..the good guys ( or girls lol ) are so capable of doing everything so well.. sometimes even too well..you don't really feel in danger..especially when literally everyone in this movie is so.. Sooo confident and arrogantly sarcastic.. The villain is not great nor charismatic enough.. It's just a really average forgettable movie, you know... You might only find it okay because of the history."
1074,5,"Disappointing - very underwhelming, poor storyline I was looking forward to this and was not impressed. The storyline was too common and I struggled to stay engaged - I willed myself to watch it to the end.Yes it had great action scenes and effects but that is all.I would give it a miss and wait for the Disney +release -"
1075,7,"ENJOYABLE FUN Haters gonna hate. Nevertheless, I liked it. We get the origin angle; a sister who trades barbs and blows on a super hero level; and plenty of action in the Mighty Marvel Manner.There are times when the acting and dialogue is over-the-top, but so what? It's a comic book movie, ya' need a couple of grins and giggles along the way.This is the 8th time Scarlett Johansson has played The Widow, and she is really relaxed and comfortable in the role. You can see it.Florence Pugh (outstanding) and Rachel Weisz (a personal favorite)...great casting choices.As for the villain...a really bad guy. Sorry, but I couldn't care less about his motivation.Until Natasha Romanoff trades vodka shots for Truly...Make Mine Marvel."
1076,3,"Meh, fell asleep more than once I love MCU, & I love Black Widow, but knew she couldn't carry her own film. Movie was boring, didn't add anything to future films/shows. Fiancé had to keep waking up. It's a bit hard to believe that between Civil War & Infinity War that Black Widow was doing all this, seemed forced."
1077,6,"What possessed the execs. I love Ray Winston as the tough guy Londoner he is, in many a good film. But what possessed the execs to give him the role of Dreykov. Ray cannot do accents. They should have known that from Kings and Prophets and Beowulf. All I was doing when Ray spoke was go wow, wow, wow. Full of lots of action. An otherwise great movie. Just for that one mistake. Sorry Ray."
1078,9,Very good This was a very good movie with lots of action and humor.It isn't as good as some of the other movies in the MCU but it is defintly in my top 5.Yelena was the best character by far!
1079,10,"As a russian man I approve this take on Future Cold War. As a Marvel fan I was highly sceptical about it. I don't like ""all power girls"" cast and the idea of prequels in general. But I watched it just because there was nothing new to watch. (I've watched Deep Space 9, Voyager, SG-1, Atlantis and etc already) So, I started to watch without any enthusiasm, and what do I see? BADAM! Fake family undercover. Very realistic. This is how our cursed (Putins KGB/FSB) goverment do things in real life. Then go toxins and pheromones. Highly likely. KGB has huge poisoning background. Usage of little kids and girls for spying purposes? Absolutely! Soft hearted Americans and Europeans just don't understand how cruel FSB methods can be. As for entertainment itself, it was solid. I even can swallow the feminisation of Taskmaster. I don't like the trend, but in this case it was done very well. Director wanted to execute the Symbolism of ""girls weapon"" to the core. So it was sacriface for the sake of Art. I gave it 10 out of 10, because I am that type of guy."
1080,5,Just ok Good story line but a tad bit confusing. Good action sequences and thought SJ was solid. Better than that tire fire Captain Marvel as this was interesting enough for me to pay attention but lacked the usual pop that Marvel. With so many Marvel movies and tv shows on the way I could have done without this one.
1081,10,"Favourite marvel movie thus far I absolutely loved this film, have seen multiple times.Scarlett is absolutely fantastic and Florence was a welcomed addition. The way they bounce off each other is incredible.From the fight scenes to car chase scenes I cannot fault this film. A must watch for sure."
1082,6,"Total disappointment It's not the worst movie of all times it's not actually that bad of a movie. I thought that the start of the movie was pretty amazing I love the documentary kind of gray style that they were going for. Midway in the movie they couldn't decide if they wanted it to be kind of more superheroes or more realistic and documentary-ish, so they did both. Which totally totally messed up the movie.CGI of the movie was another really really big problem it just looks so unrealistic. I mean I have watched other Marvel movies with so many CGI and they were good, this one was bad and I'm pretty sure it's not because they had a low budget or anything I can't believe that what's the case.Also it didn't really give people what they want it like, people wanted to see Natasha escaping from the red room. Things that happened in her past we were supposed to see things that we were never got to see , and answer the questions that we were wondering. But we never got that thing about Natasha's past really. We're just kind of went onto a new Thing, not Natasha's past in the redroom but destroying the red room."
1083,7,"Black Widow I've seen all of the MCU films and TV shows so far and have to say this isn't amazing nor awful. The plot is pretty simple and the film plows through, giving backstory to what happened in Budapest, in Black Widow's childhood and her family. I liked it and thought that it was better than other female lead films like Captain Marvel and SW Sequels (8&9). It's a good watch with pals but comic book fans will be disappointed with Taskmaster, lots to look forward to and lots to reflect on. Not a contestant for the best MCU film but more of a underdog wanting a bite. THERE IS AN END CREDITS SCENE!"
1084,9,"A must-watch for sure! From someone who hasn't watched all Marvel movies YET (it's still a process, excuse me), I must say that the movie is very entertaining and pleasant to watch, as it's very funny, (I laughed many times myself during the film), specially with friends/family. Florence Pugh smashed the screen with her acting and I would love to see more of her in action movies!! Definitely a catch."
1085,7,"Second time around I watched this movie when it first came out and was so utterly confused I got mad and deleted from my mind the family get together altogether at the mom's house. I even wrote my review about it. I went back and literally watched all the marvel movies in order of release and then watched Black Widow again. It wasn't as confusing but there were specific parts the editor either lost argument to the first time action director, or simply made bad choices. Then there were points no one seems to talk about like I don't think any plane can take off with a person ON the wing like ever (unless maybe some space design that shoots boosters to the ground and shoot the plane straight up and then around the sky in like any direction after take off): another point being the ""bad guy"" in the blue suit is like Captain America gone crazy with the same round shield that gets thrown sidearm with very little difference (just change ONE thing and then you don't have that direct copycat annoying tug at your brain). The opening is simply boring until you figure out who is who and why (simple fix is start off with a voiceover from Black Widow that's like ""you want to hear how I got started?"" Or something of the like, or a scene with Black Widow looking in the mirror and then take us back to her childhood as that's like 5 seconds or add in the sister photos at the mirror). As for the rest it does make sense except why if you have all these female assassins would you ever have some dumb male soldiers hanging around? Also why so few widows considering overall size of operation? I say just watch it and enjoy what it is."
1086,2,"What a Giant Waste of Time! There is nothing good in the movie, just a vomit of CGI on the screen like it's a Transformers movie, there is zero creativity from the filmmakers, bad acting, bad music, boring actions scenes and a horrible script.Black Widow should have been dead in the 26 minute mark on the bridge, but the filmmakers slit the throat of logic through antier movie.The lead characters are presented as the ""good guys"" and they are far from being acceptable people."
1087,9,"Good movie I don't know what everyone's talking about,I enjoyed it."
1088,9,"Did not disappoint I was going into the movie expecting the same old generic Marvel movie, but instead I got more than that.. in some ways. I'm very happy with the result. This movie is not only a great Marvel movie, but a good movie altogether. Because, unlike a lot of Marvel movies, it does feel like there are stakes, a key thing missing in a lot of the MCU. Part of that is because of the Spy/Thriller elements to this movie that keep the tone darker when necessary, and incorporate some good sets, but also because of the heart and emotion in this movie, that is conveyed through the trauma each of the main characters have to deal with (somewhat), and their connectivity as a ""family"". Each of the characters do have a lot of the witty humour, but it doesn't come across as being so formulaic here, instead it's actually funny and only used appropriately. Along with that the characters are individual and each have real stakes in the story, although most are lacking proper depth. This movie also has a lot of really engaging Spy/Thriller elements, more akin to the Mission: Impossible films, which gives it a more unique tone for an MCU movie and makes for some great action sequences. The main villain serves his purpose in the story, and provides a shadow of mystery and a looming sense of threat, before he is introduced to be ruthless and cold, making for a decent antagonist. However, what brings this movie down is that it presents so many potentially complex and dark themes, but as usual with the MCU, it doesn't fully engage with the concepts presented, and thus gives the characters less depth. Other than that, this is a solid action flick that goes beyond most Marvel films and is sure to entertain."
1089,9,"Brilliant! I'm so confused by the mediocre reviews of this movie, it was fantastic!The fight scenes were among Marvel's best - one particular scene near the end far surpassed even the freeway fight in Captain America and the Winter Soldier, something I never thought I'd see in the MCU.This added a great depth to Natasha's character while also introducing some brilliant new characters into the fold; specifically Florence Pugh as Yelena (who we all know will be the Widow to watch going forwards, and I for one can't wait!) and David Harbour as the hilarious Alexei.The script was exactly as I've come to expect from Marvel with plenty of laughter, some brilliant call backs and Easter eggs for movie and comic book fans alike, a couple of gasps, a few air punch moments and even some tears.We all know that a Black Widow stand-alone movie has been long overdue, but having watched this I'm personally glad they waited until now to release. Brought out ten or even five years ago, this movie would never have felt as empowering and might just have felt like an empty gesture. But now nothing could be further from the truth.Thank you for this Marvel; you made me leave the cinema wishing I was a little girl again just so I could've had these characters to cheer for back then. And I cannot wait to see what happens to Yelena next in the MCU!"
1090,5,"Rather boring - don't make it your first movie post the reopening of the cinemas It will suffice to say that I am longing for what's coming up in the MCU, just so that I can partially make up for the time I spent watching Black Widow. I was disappointed to say the least.... And to think that we'd all been waiting for it for over a year due to coronavirus.... Pity..........On the bright side, I have to admit that the opening scene is jaw-dropping, as well as the use of Natasha's manipulation skills."
1091,8,"Great, if you are in the mood for a little nonsense Somehow it was the thing I needed that day.Shaky handheld camera from time to time did not fit to overall movie's and marvel's camera concept, maybe they tried to give it more rawness and roughness to make it more distinct from perfect american way the other marvel movies were shot.Physics does not apply to action or sound. But well paced and it brought a lot of ridiculous action. I was on the hype of this nonsense and enjoying all of it while watching. No idea why though..."
1092,2,"Stupid kid fare At 20 min.. spy cuts open the abdomen of another girl, disemboweling her... and her shirt is a little damp. No blood on the ground, nothing... Oh god. Just stupid pointless pg-13 clap trap. But it'll still earn 8 billion dollars *sigh*"
1093,6,"Incoherent As long as you don't really try to follow the plot, it is rather watchable and entertaining."
1094,3,"Bad. Bad storyline, bad writing and poor dialogues. Pretty disappointing."
1095,5,"No Stakes = Boring and dull It's called Black Widow but the name is not enough , the story does not fit the character. Scarlet has a great presence in every scene she's in. The movie is a missed opportunity imo Not only is the movie 6 years late in the MCU but Black Widow is not a superhero in the same sense as Captain America."
1096,6,Great action scenes but pointless movie We literally learn pretty much nothing about black widows character which we didn't already know and this film adds nothing of value to her character. Black widow pretty much takes a back seat in the movie which just doesn't make any sense. Honestly this movie should have been made before infinity war and it would have made more sense.
1097,2,Nope Save your money. Loved marvel movies but keep your money on this one.
1098,10,I just liked it and i will always do. Despite the fact that i love Nat i really enjoyed the movie and i will deffinetly watch it again. My opinion.
1099,1,"Don't waste your time. All male characters (2) are a joke, either they're fat and can't be taken seriously or they take advantage of women. All the female characters (endless) are badass and fix everything. Typical political move..The accents are annoying.The jokes are low hanging fruit.The emotional scenes are uncomfortable.Taskmaster was a wasted opportunity, I wish they didn't even touch the character.Also had no significance to the MCU."
1100,7,"very good Its first time i watch the Avengers, the movie is an fastantic."
1101,6,"This story dose not fit the character! I was expecting a spy movie and got a mediocre brawler.. If not for Scarlet Johnson performance and the broken family dynamics, this movie would have been a total fail for me..This was a missed opportunity to make something great and different. I was hoping that the Red room would have had some connection to the super solider program but it is never really expanded on.It could have explained a lot of things, like how the black widow's can take so much punishment when fighting and why they have to be sterilized. There was a lot of opportunity for expanding the character and story line.It would have created more exciting build for the new black widow that we see in the end of the movie.."
1102,7,"Black Widow is a pretty good watch. I was entertained. I didn't feel like Natasha was a sidekick to her sister, in her own movie. Perhaps people are just unfamiliar with the concept of character development, now?There were a few ridiculous things in this movie that I did not like, such as the revelation of who Taskmaster was (and the character design), plus the emasculation of Red Guardian, but overall, it was a highly entertaining flick, and you could connect with the two leads (ScarJo & Pugh).It was fun and I enjoyed it. You ignore the bad and take it for what it is (a Superhero/action movie) and you'll enjoy it. It was certainly far better than Captain Marvel.It does not deserve as much hate as it's gotten in some circles, and actually the user reviews appear to reflect that."
1103,9,"Action Is Quality Of Marvel As You All Know, Past 2 Series Were Not So Good In Terms Of Action & Some Marvel Spices...."
1104,2,Oooo dear I really don't get the Florence Pugh hype.love Scarlett Johansson usually but she's not been given enough to work with. Why focus on Pugh?
1105,7,"A Good Marvel Romp If this wasn't the Marvel universe, the word I would use for this movie is 'far fetched'. But as a marvel movie it's a good romp. Someone told me Scarlet Johansson carries every scene. Yes she does but the support from Florence Pugh is excellent and I love her sarcastic sense of humour. The movie is exciting and the story keeps going even if the 'world dominating megalomaniac' bad guy theme is a little overworn these days. Don't forget to wait for the short clip after the credits have finished."
1106,4,Fail We expect more... this is not a superhero movie we want. Scarlet johnsen at her best but story is very poor like some low budget bollywood movie.
1107,8,"""Not the film we wanted, but the one we needed."" Sure it would have been interesting to see the black widow origins, the ballet school setting we were hinted at throughout the avengers films, but this film, a stunning and heart breaking show of Nat's reunion with her original family is equally fantastic. The film portrays the realistic and terrifying theme of Women's autonomy, and the painful realness of found family and the issues that can be woven within it.Ignore all the incels and over sexualising misogynistic critics, they don't have the ability to see this film for what it is. The beginning of the end of one of the best characters in the MCU, and it was portrayed magnificently.It may not have been the film we wanted, but it was the film we needed."
1108,8,"Haters everywhere I read all the spoilers and reviews before watching this movie and thought it would be a mess of a movie but it was actually really good. All the characters were so entertaining and perfectly used, the story is not as outrageous as any other marvel movie and the action was fun (except the ending)The ending and the mind control were a bit of a stretch but so are most mcu end battles and we've seen mind control in the mcu too so it's not that hard to believe. But the characters are truly some of my favorite new editions to the mcu. Really really liked this movie. It's super fun but takes itself seriously when it has to, and honestly is better than most mcu origin movies. Don't listen to the haters and form your own opinion watching this movie."
1109,10,Truly heart-wrenching story with the right amount of Marvel action The compelling true story of the human trafficking of little girls always gets to me. A lot of similarities to the winter soldier that I love but with a real life twist that makes it even stronger. The strength Natasha holds with everything that has happened to her is amazing. She is really becoming a three dimensional character (sadly we won't get deeper than this) and that is what makes this movie so unique.The underdeveloped male character (a mirror to what women always are in Marvel movies) makes me laugh.I've watched it more than once and I can honestly say it deserves even more hype than CA:TWS.Also one of the only Marvel movies that does not 100% cater to men.Refreshingly new perspective with classic Marvel action and sass.
1110,3,"Takes Itself Too Seriously Super heroes aren't characters - they are caricatures. They are a juvenile fantasy that has no basis in reality. Therefore, movies (like this one) that try to earnestly focus on the backstory and family dynamics of a superhero are doomed to fail. IMO, superhero movies work when they are fun, light-hearted, creative, and don't take themselves too seriously (e.g., Thor: Ragnarok). There are no action sequences or special effects in Black Widow that I haven't seen before. And I just wasn't that interested in the fact that a ""super assassin"" who was ""engineered"" by an evil Soviet regime had a dysfunctional family. I like Scarlet Johansson. But there just wasn't anything here for her to work with."
1111,10,Awesome Awesome movie. Great action scenes and storytelling.
1112,10,"Red Guardian having ""KARL"" and ""MARX"" tattooed on his knuckles is the coolest thing a character has ever done in a marvel movie. He also has Natasha and Yelena's names on him despite not having seen them for twenty years and only complaining about having to look after them- good dad behaviour- and he's having a portrait of himself tattooed on his own back. The absolute gall of the man is sensational."
1113,10,best marvel origin story since black panther If you like marvel origin stories and James bond then this movie is for you!!! Stay after the main credits for a bonus scene.
1114,1,"Childishly embarrassing nonsense Awful acting, terrible dialogue and Russian accents. Nonsensical script, and long periods of utter boredom makes this one if the very worst films I have ever seen."
1115,1,"Truly terrible Anyone giving this a good review has their Marvel blinders on, don't trust them. This film was lazy, pointless and a complete waste of potential. Black Widow was a side character in her own film, the whole film was the Yelena show and setting her up for the Hawkeye tv show. This film has put me off watching the content that comes from Marvel next. Completely uninspired and lazy, I feel empty after powering through this tripe and I am not exaggerating. Pass."
1116,4,More like a Jason Bourne movie This movie didn't feel like a typical MCU movie and not in a good way.The plot was predictable with all the typical clichés. Red Guardian was absolutely useless and just a punching bag.The villain was a Harvey Weinstein rip-off that lacked depth and nuance.
1117,4,"Disappointing. Overall, I thought that this movie was disappointing. I thought the action scenes were not as good or as intense as they could have been. The teasing the sisters give each other, I thought, was somewhat subdued. More so than I've noticed real sisters do to each other. And near the end Alexei/Red Guardian basically has the floor mopped up with him by the tool of the film's bad guy who has the same skills if not more so as the Black Widow has. He was unable to throw a punch during the fight. And the bad guy in the film comes across as a mafioso which I don't think helped the film at all. With that said it's good to see Rachael Weisz-one of my favorite actors by the way-on the screen again."
1118,1,Not a marvel level movie Disappointed expected more form this movie after Endgame movie was no of marvel level👎
1119,7,"Not great, not terrible Black WIdow is a dozen film, the acting and the stories are alright.It's not however a much better than any other SPY/ Mind control movies, it dosen't have the twitst that makes it a great film, like let's say Infinity War.The early childhod of the family was nto enoguht developed to establish a meanfull conections, I didn't care about either of them, exept Black Widow only becouse I watch other Marvel films.The visual effects loos a bit forced, a bit of Michael Bay in explositions especialy in the last act.And we all know they couded at least made the red fight the blue in a sentence in this movie, but they failed to delvier to that to . ( ;) )SO 7/10 mostly for the performance of the actors and the settings."
1120,6,"Riding Marvel's rollercoaster If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you probably felt the emotional rollercoaster that these movies cause. We can see a fantastic piece of work being done and the next movie is simply mediocre.I do take my hat off since lately Marvel seems to have found its pace and has been on a high note, both in movies and TV, but Black Widow undoes all that work.For starters, I don't know if it's only me but I am a Scarlett Johansson's fan overall as an actor so I usually don't point out flaws in that department, but in this movie she didn't quite seem to be in character, it's hard to figure out if it was potentially made on purpose to showcase a different side of Natasha, but for me it simply feels odd, one thing is to show humanity other completely different is changing the character's personality, it didn't feel like the Black Widow we see portrayed in the other movies (as an example in Endgame we do see a changed Natasha, but there it feels organic, like a good development).Then we start to see where the bigger problems are, the action scenes feel completely off and the editing is very poorly made, filled with fast changing sequences where we can't see half of what's happening, and then there's also the very bad CGI which is something that you for sure do not expect from a big budget Marvel movie.Although the story does have potential and it kind of makes sense giving the period where it takes place, I didn't buy the whole ""family"" dynamic, it feels very forced and there is absolutely no chemistry there, I didn't care for any of the characters aside from Natasha and her sister and also I don't care how good David Harbour as a performer, as the ""comedy relief"" in this movie it's just blend and unfunny, nothing against the actor or his portrayal I just don't think the character is good, feels completely irrelevant.The movie as a whole as some interesting aspects to it and it's not an overall terrible film, Florence Pugh is without a doubt the best thing that comes out of this, a very solid a believable performance, good character and I have this strong suspicion that it's not by accident as we most likely will see more of her very very soon."
1121,6,"Not Bad, Not Great I just couldn't digest Rachel's and David's change of dialogue delivery. While in the beginning they spoke an American English but later on, they have a Russian tone, specially David. It was way over the top.The fight scene between Scarlett and Florence made me feel a bit of Bourne but then it falls down drastically. The fight scenes and the entire climax is a tad much.With more than 120 minutes, the film was lengthy and some scenes were a little bore."
1122,1,"The worst Marvel movie I've seen I had high hopes, as I love many Marvel films. Truly didn't know they had it in them to make such a bad movie.It basically jumps from one purposeless action scene to another, each bringing even less to the story than the last. Almost every character feels fake, especially the parents and the villain. For no reason the parents (as well as Yelena) start speaking with a heavy Russian accent even though you see at the start of the movie they are perfectly capable of speaking American English. This adds to the feeling that everything is fake and doesn't hold up.The movie sometimes tries to be emotional, but fails miserably every time.On the plus side, Yelena is a funny character. You could watch a 3 minute extract of her funny scenes and save yourself the time."
1123,5,Overrated Although not terrible or anything this movie is definitely overrated. It wasn't really fun and fast-paced like some of the other marvel movies. At times I felt like I was sitting in that long boring joker movie again. It's just the average at best but not terrible.
1124,6,"6.4 Starts off a mess. I dislike exposition, but lack of exposition which might add some clarity is worse than lazy exposition. Once the movie slows down, it gets much better. Still definitely not without flaws, but there is some good stuff to be had. End action gets clunky and cheesy as well, but so much better than the beginning as well."
1125,2,"Rubbish, don't bother. Ray Winstone the Cockney Russian!! Worst accent ever!! Why does nobody tell them that they are crap? Millions of pounds spent and nobody noticed?And don't get me started on the diversity quota? Russia that beautiful country known for its massive density of people of colour, literally at the end of the film the majority of widows are black or some other ethnic minority!! It's idiotic!!"
1126,3,"could this be a joke? Marvel movies have never received a low rating from me... Could this be a joke? Truth be told... It wasn't as good as it could have been. Basically, the whole thing was dull, lengthy, and doo-doo. There seems to be a lot of information lacking, making things very confusing. It had thrown me off within the first ten minutes, I actually stood up to take a bathroom break. The only enjoyable aspect here was the graphics... literally, the graphics and the fighting were by far the most appealing things."
1127,5,"Black A story that was not at the level...poor in terms of action, knowing that the Avengers company focuses a lot on action and visual effects."
1128,8,"Great marvel movie Dont get me wrong, I love a movie like this one, chicks that kick ass, take names, etc... but I can't help but think that in 20 years, these ""oscar"" actors will realize their entire careers are dedicated to disney. Not a bad thing, just saying."
1129,5,"Missed chance, no need Watch Natasha's 30 seconds of flashback from avengers:age of ultron and search for 5 minutes of big recorded explosions on youtube and you're good to go, you'll be saving 2 hours.They bluntly missed a great opportunity to shoot a subtle and canny spy thriller with a good solo story about a mourned, well-developed character. I mean, everybody is aware she's not thor or steve rogers, why not try something different than exploding sky castles or blowing up prisons. Lastly, such a wasteful use of the taskmaster."
1130,7,"A solid 7... do people cry about everything these days? It was a 7 in about every way it could be. It was okay... it might of been an allegory for something, I'm not sure. It seemed to have some hidden message of it's own. But as a movie, just watching it as one it's about a 7.... I don't know if I'd watch it again but it was entertaining."
1131,10,"DC fanboys have raided reviews Certainly not as great as Civil War, most definitely not as bad as a lot of reviewers are saying.Good acting, plausible plot, disappointingly cut action scenes, typical Marvel snarky dialogues & overused cg. One of the reasons why many reviewers didn't like (read: hated) the movie is probably because it's a little too late, we already know what happens to our beloved Nat & maybe some people just can't get over endgame and Phase 1-3 to like something new.Easily deserves 6+/10, rating 10 just to balance out an unnecessarily negative review."
1132,5,"What? I watched this film in the cinema, and as I was walking back I was contemplating on how to properly state my frustrations with it - that said, I'll start off with the good, and end of with the bad.The best thing about this film, was probably David harbour, not that his acting was brilliant, but god damn it was better than the majority of the other performances in this film.The visuals where also incredibly good looking, especially the scene where Natasha's car was falling off of the bridge, it just looked brilliant. However it didn't impress me more than that, and I'll get into that later.The twist where the robot guy hunting everyone down was actually the girl that Johansson killed, was pretty good and created some genuine shock from me, however the film never really built on it, and I think the actress who played that girl had like 3 lines in total, which is pretty $h!!.The action scenes where also pretty entertaining, with some perfect explosions, however that's about all that I liked about this film.The story was dull, and the reason for actually starting the mission to find the red zone was, ""because it might be fun""? Waht? The entire concept of the red zone was also not explained well enough, with the ""bad guy"" not really even having a clear motive, creating a clash between Natasha and him that had no real bases. I mean, she didn't even know he killed her mother before she got there, so what does she really have against him? - I know it's explained in other MCU movies, but it isn't in this one, and it makes that part of the story fall apart.The other thing I have an issue with, is the Cinematography, it's way too shaky, now I like handheld, but god damn it's a bit much in this, it's not even the most shaky during action scenes, but rather at the start of the movie, and during other Radom shots that have no merit for this type of shakiness. Overall though the cinematography looks good, however, it doesn't really ""say"" anything about the story, with the exception of a couple close ups.Editing was mostly unnoticeable, which is good in my eye, however, some scene transitions where a bit bad, with random pauses, or awkward lines used in the background of the sound mix to help ease some weird transitions- but that issue may be in part to the absolutely awful good for nothing script;Now, I need to explain something before I get into this, the story, and the script are different things, the story, in my eye, is the potential rating of the narrative being told at it's best, however, the script is all the lines, narrative structure, and how well the story is actually told rather than the story itself.In this film, the writing was, well, trash garbage, the best line in the entire film was during the end, where the ""mother"" of the two spy kids, replies ""I am clearly injured"" - it's such a bad line it's good and I will remember it, and cherish it's existence forever. All jokes aside though, the script is bad, with lines that sound out of place, and not natural to say, they're probably part of the reason the acting was not that great.There are also so many cliche moments, that I just can't mention even half of them. The stand outs are as follows;Just catching the plane during the intro of the filmJust catching the helicopter during the avalancheExplosions in the background of the lead characters during the red zone explosion scenesThe characters having a plan A B C D E and F for the infiltration of the uninflatable red zoneand it can just go onThe cgi is also horrible, with clear rotoscoping outlines and horrible compositing where shadows and light sources hit each other in opposite directions, creating this almost uncanny look in the final segment of the film which takes you out of it entirely - all I can see in my head when watching the final act of this film is Scarlett screaming into a camera with a blue screenSo in conclusion, if you are a film buff, you watched this film to critique it, if you are an MCU fan, you where heavily underwhelmed but entertained - and if you don't fall into either categories, I feel sorry for the waste of time this movie is - and as Scorsese rightly put, films like these are not cinema, but the craft that goes into creating them is immense when done right - this one was not done right...Story - 6/10Cinematography - 6/10CGI - 2/10Acting - 5/10Character Development - 4/10Script - 3/10Sound - 7/10Editing - 6/10."
1133,6,Mediocre and dissapointing Movie full of qliches and stereotypes about everything and everyone. Guys are portreyed as morons or anoying and useless. Girls are strong yet lack of any character. Only little sister character has some real value.
1134,4,"Awful It was a disaster. From minute 44 after the family met, they ruined the script. Anyway. Don't waste your time on this."
1135,6,"5 years to late It would have been a great filler movie if it was placed in the right order. It should have been sooner not so late that it did not matter anymore. Black widow was great and mom and sister was there too but the dad, they wrote him in the worst way possible. So sad."
1136,7,"Black Widow (David Harbour and Florence Pugh Steal The Show) First of all, I'm not a big Marvel fan but I did enjoy all its movies. In this case, for opening it seemed pretty good especially for flight scene but just my two cent opinion for natasha's childhood story was quite short. Her childhood story could be more deeply on how she was going through in a Red Room, how she can met her family figure. It becomes quite interesting to know.Furthermore, they can show more on how Natasha escaped from Ross. To me accent is not the main problem because it's really hard to bring it on. The casts, Scarlett Johansson (Natasha) she played pretty well in her role especially for action scenes same goes to Rachel Weisz (Melina) as a mother's role. Surprisingly, David Harbour (Alexei/Red Guardian) and Florence Pugh (Yelena) steal the show. David steals especially with his jokes, prison escape scene and also annoying dad's role while Florence with her action. David's jokes bring all spectaculars having much fun to enjoy this movie. I love that one.In addition, for Red Guardian (David Harbour), hopefully can see more from him in future since his character didn't utilized so much for action scenes as he actually can show his strength in fighting. There are several action scenes by Red Guardian but they cut probably they want to save the time. It's okay if the duration time of this movie is longer as long as all spectaculars still enjoy with it. I do like the family dynamic that played by Scarlett, Florence, David and Rachel because it looks like genuinely. The storyline is okay.Overall, this film is funny, emotional and enjoyable. My opinion and rating perhaps not for Marvel fan. But what I can say is don't get easily to trust on what people say until you watch this movie first. Put aside all negativity perspectives that created by others till you decide your own one."
1137,6,Black Widow deserves a better one! Just like what the other reviewers say... The long awaited solo film for Black Widow is only an average film. I wanted a better villain. I also wanted to know more about her past. Oh cmon... She sacrificed herself! Black Widow should've gotten a better movie. I am sorry Marvel.
1138,1,Trash For the love of.. She isnt supposed to be superpowered but she is. Forgetable plot that doesnt make sense and the biggest waste of popular character since Jaws the Revenge. Taskmaster could have had his own series for petes sake.
1139,7,Why i gave it a 7 Black widow was an average marvel movie that felt not alot like her own solo movie it felt like if avengers had a Russian captain america and 2 other black widows the taskmaster reveal was horrible and who you expect the cgi was and the opening was awesome but overall a awesome movie.
1140,5,"Natasha Romanov deserves a better movie than this Everyone knows how Black Widow has always been overshadowed by all the other Avengers, even though she is 100% bad ass. So, when she finally got her own movie, all I could say was, ""FINALLY"". But to my surprise, Black Widow (Natasha) did not even seem like the star of the show - not that the other Black Widow (Yelena) was bad. Similar to other Marvel movies, the comedic relief was on par. The plot seems to stay consistent with the Marvel cinematic world. But, unlike all the other Marvel franchise, the villain in this movie was PLAIN AF - no likeability, no charisma, and has a pointless storyline. Of course, like any Marvel movie, even the disastrous Incredible Hulk (2008), most people would still be able to say that it was at least entertaining to some extent."
1141,4,Ignore Marvep Fanboys who give 11/10 Its bad the Toxic marvel fans should accept it not fool themself.
1142,9,"Marvel movie Such an amazing movie , marvel never fails to amaze you and David harbour was soo awesome."
1143,5,Generic and boring Bombs don't seem to be effective in this movie. Everyone survives without a scratchThere is a realism/consistency missing that characterizes marvel movies.
1144,6,"Dark, closer to 6 than 7 I enjoy movies that shows strong females that are capable. When they are capable of defending themselves well, I root for them. But this movie borders on the Darkside of psychology, mine control, and abuse. Most of the movie is that way to they don't bring out a lot of the more positive interplay that happens between some of the characters. Overall I will not try to follow black widow is one of the marvel characters. This characterization is just sad. Women are abused the world over... this character is not well developed in that context at all. Abuse should not have been the context for her skills. Appropriate training would've been a heck of a lot more interesting."
1145,6,"""Black Widow"" movie hasn't energy. ""Natasha"" is a powerful fighter in avengers team and she is a very motivative girl. But this time she hasn't any energy. I don't know why is that. And ""cgi"" technology is worst this movie."
1146,5,Very cheap If u are over 10 years old you're not going to like it.
1147,6,"Mediocre Black Widow starts promising, because it might delve into the background of the popular superheroine, but that was misleading. Instead of a formulaic origin movie, Black Widow becomes a women versus men story without a decent villain and disappointing action.As great as it is that female heroes get their chance to shine, Black Widow takes this too far, as this film turns into a flick that is all about women, fighting to escape the men who control them. Even the reveal of the villain Taskmaster and the film's conclusion is a testament to the fact that Black Widow chooses ""symbolism all over the place"" instead of action/entertainment.Although there is nothing wrong with a deeper layer, there is none of that in Black Widow. Besides the very likable Florence Pugh who might one day replace Scarlett Johansson, there are no memorable characters or actors/actresses in this movie. Not even The Red Guardian who brings some light moments, has a memorable part. And the climax, incl. The fight scenes, is forgettable.That's not to say Black Widow is a bad movie. The judgement is far worse: Black Widow as a movie was boring and unnecessary. If you appreciate superheroine movies (and you should), than Captain Marvel is the better choice."
1148,1,"Over emotional drivel Ok so poor story line, terrible back story for the villain, completely over emotional, it was essential a super hero / Mexican soap opera.I'd rather watch Wonder woman 2(which was the worst super hero movie ever made) on repeat than watch this again.This movie has literally put me off watching Marvel out DC's cinematic universes. And I am a massive comic fan boy."

1150,8,"Good movie, but... This movie was entertaining, but at the same time very slow. This movie did have great action but with some bad CGI, not to bad. Part of the story did not have enough to explain. A lot was left out. Other than that, it was funny, fun, good acting, and very much watchable. 8/10 and recommended!"
1151,2,"CGI A$$ Umm 5'4"" girl with no super powers??, not even Scarlett's great CGI A$$ can save this movie..."
1152,7,"Surprisingly solid and entertaining As ""Black Widow"" (2021 release; 134 min.) opens, it is ""Ohio, 1995"", as we see 2 little girls play. When dad comes home, he announces that the family needs to leave, and leave right now. Dad, mom and the 2 girls fly out and next we are in ""Cuba"", where it is revealed that mom and dad were part of a Russian spy cell planted in Ohio. The 2 girls are separated from mom and dad... At this point we are 10 min. Into the movie.Couple of comments: let me state upfront that I have never seen a Marvel Universe film... until now! I simply am not all that interested in all those superheroes movies. But there was something about ""Black Widow"" that made me think this film might be a little different. And as it turns out, I ended up enjoying this quite a bit. There are several reasons for that: great story line (even though some of the Marvel Universe references were lost on me); nice pacing of the movie, with a good dose of action scenes, and some humor, and some quiet(er) moments. Plus of course a great all-star cast, headed by Scarlett Johansson. Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, etc. Bottom line: director Cate Shortland (whose 2012 film ""Lore"" was outstanding) has delivered a surprisingly solid and entertaining film that stands on its own within the Marvel Universe, and I am the very proof that one doesn't need to have seen any of the previous Marvel Universe films to enjoy this one.""Black Widow"" was supposed to have been released in theaters in May, 2020. COVID-10 had other plans, pushing the movie to July, 2021. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (about 15-20 people, keep in mind the movie has been out for 4 weeks mow). If you, like myself, have never seen a Marvel Universe film but are curious, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
1153,9,"Some of Marvel's best work Definitely not the best marvel movie but it's up there in the top 5. Packed with action and thrilling moments. The characters were very entertaining and over all, it was one of the best movie theater experiences I've ever had."
1154,3,"David Harbour, what was the only good thing in this film. David Harbour was the only thing I enjoyed in this movie, i don't relay follow the mcu so i had no idea what was going on and what/how ""black widow"" is and what/why she is doing any of this?.The action was very cringey, and the constant camera switching made it look so broken up and every where.Not a good movie, just watch some martial art movie instead."
1155,5,Kinda pointless This movie is kinda pointless and not that enjoyable. If you are a marvel fan don't watch the movie just look up the post credit scene on YouTube or something.
1156,7,"One time watch movie Finally, Natasha getting her solo film, little too late. Aftermath of the avengers falldown after civil war. Some nice action sequences. Florence Pugh takes a lot of focus. She is the leader of widows now. This movie revolves around a lot of family dynamics; love, care, trust. Although widows were poorly utilised in this. All of this to take down the megalomaniac. The end credit is interesting as to what people on Earth think happened on vormir or the red room still operates. Still have to tumble that kingdom."
1157,4,"False Widow Lots of CGI, poor story, unengaging characters all adds up to a non-event."
1158,8,"Nothing new, typically Marvel Entertaining. Nothing more nothing less. For that, I gave it an 8."
1159,6,"Average MCU Film!! 'Black Widow' is Marvel Studios first MCU film since 2019. This film is the first and only solo story for Scarlett Johansson's character that she has been playing since 2010's 'Iron Man 2'. It is chronologically set between 'Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Infinity War' and is directed by Cate Shortland.As mentioned, it stars Scarlett Johansson as the titular character in her ninth outing as the hero. Along with Johansson this movie stars MCU newcomers Florence Pugh as 'Yelena Belova' and David Harbour as 'Alexei Shostakov'. This film is carried by Pugh and Harbour. They are brilliant and hilarious in their roles along with having great chemistry. Yelena Bolova's introduction into this franchise gives hope for the upcoming titles in which she will appear.Main villains have always been an issue for the MCU, most of them being fairly lacklustre, with very few breaking the mould set but the previous titles. This film follows that same formula with the character of 'Taskmaster'. In the source material, 'Taskmaster' is Tony Masters, a mercenary with photographic reflexes, meaning he can replicate the physical skills of anyone. However, in this film they changed him to Antonia, personally I don't care about the filmmakers changing the gender of the character but I really don't like them turning the villain into a mere henchwoman instead of the badass mercenary that he was in the comics. Taskmaster wasn't the only poor villain, Ray Winstone's 'Dreykov' is positioned as the main adversary for Johansson's protagonist. His Russian accent is abysmal and his character is equally nonsensical. I don't understand making him the main villain when you have the potential of a huge fan favourite character like 'Taskmaster'.This film could've been so much more than it eventually was. If this was made back in 2016 after 'Captain America: Civil War', when it is set, than it could've taken more risks with the plot, and change the fate of some of the minor characters. This movie could've been a really lovely story about family and a family coming together after a long time, a plot that would've been very relatable with many people. However, it turns into a classic Marvel film in the third act and it becomes a normal CGI centric picture that takes the audience out of the grounded story they were previously telling.Overall, 'Black Widow' is an average Marvel picture which takes minimal risks and doesn't live up to what this film could've been. It was carried by most of the cast but was severely let down by the flat and uninspired antagonists.6.5/10."
1160,10,"Amazing......😍😍😍😍 Every single shot in the movie was so excellent and will done Good movie,music,nature everything thank u marvel."
1161,9,Amazing This film is amazing i plan to rewatch it on disney plus quite alot but being back in cinema mad this film even better to watch the only thing that ruined this for me a the task master unmasking and the person being personal to natasha but overall good comedy amazing action and just most rewatch able mcu film.
1162,6,"My expectations were so low that I ended up enjoying this film. Is it a good film? Not really. I enjoyed some of the humour and the fight scenes but the script is weak, the villain is underdeveloped, the CGI seems dated and the conclusion is just another Marvel fireball in the sky.Pugh is brilliant, Harbour is underused, Johansson is passable and Winstone is awful. Seriously, after The Departed didn't anyone realise that he can't do accents?Taskmaster deserved better than this!"
1163,10,the movie is amazing This movie is amazing loved it one of my favourite marvel movies. Watch it.
1164,9,i love it Excellent and very entertaining movie i give 9.This kind of movies as to be watch and not write critic.
1165,4,"They did Black Widow dirty This ain't your typical Marvel movie. It's about SPIES. Not just any spies. RUSSIAN SPIES.The idea of a Marvel spy movie staring Black Widow seems like a great idea on paper. Unfortunately, the movie just wasn't... good. The intro felt like 10 minutes long. Some of the things these characters do are just straight up stupid.In the movie, Natalia's receives some antidote from her sister that she hasn't spoken to in ages. She then heads out to find her sister and ask her why did she send the tubes to her. When she meets her, Natalia's sister gets mad and says that Natalia was supposed to have hid the antidote. Aren't spies suppose to be smart and discreet? She should have at least left some code message for Natalia. Natalia, being out of the spy game for awhile can't dissect the code and tries to look for her sister instead. I think that would have made more sense.Honestly, as a stand alone movie it could have been a 5 but Marvel movies have set the bar so high that this could be the weakest movie they've released. So by Marvel movie standards, it's a 4."
1166,5,"Nothing different Having actors and actresses that are not Russian is the biggest problem with this movie. Its sad to seeing on how much this movie does not like to rely on authenticity but instead relies solely on commercialising the movie with american and british actors insteadThe plot is average and the action we've seen before....like the movie tries to play smart but instead it turns out to be a boring affairAnd Ray Winstone seems to look like a Geordie instead of what one assume to be a tragic, garbage performance as a Russian😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
1167,4,"Closure Problem. Having followed all the movies of the MCU i can definitely tell that with each upcoming movie, series it's getting harder for a closure. Bringing the character plot back who we know has already departed(as per the storyline), these past sequels has started loosing the very baseline of a superhero storyline. As per my personal experience watching the movie was like watching the movie ""Red Sparrow"" yet again just with Scarlett Johannson. I hope that the upcoming prequels/sequels doesn't create up a mess for the MCU, a mess which would get really hard to clear up."
1168,5,"Fun, flash in the pan. I was leaving the cinema yesterday mostly pleased.In all seriousness, don't expect a well-written movie with a credible story. It's very flash. The cgi was average. But did the job intended.Some characters were hit and miss. The Red Guardian was, for the most part, delightful and provided humour throughout.Natasha's sister Yelena was great, and the back and forth between the sisters worked.The villains are dumb and annoying. The side villain taskmaster was the biggest disappointment. I loved his overconfident swagger in the comics. They treat him like Deadpool from origins wolverine.A big Dumb B movie. It won't win rewards but an enjoyable watch with a disappointing climax."
1169,6,"Disappointed for the potential the story would have had I had really high expectations with the interesting background of Natasha Romanoff and her training in the red room and how she escaped and became an Avenger. And the beginning was really good, especially the opening credits with ""smells like teen spirit"" was one of the best things Marvel has ever made. In the dark Cinema and the loud music, everyone had goosebumps and it was an fantastic atmosphere. But sadly after that the movie took a turn to a ""classic, normal, unsepectecular"" action movie and didn't used the potential the story would have had. So overall it is a solid action movie, nothing special and nothing bad, but in my opinion one of the worse MCU movies."
1170,7,"GOOD NOT GREAT FUN...! The latest MCU entry is a worthy one for at least giving ScarJo a decent rite of departure after her self sacrifice in End Game. Taking place between Civil War & Infinity War, the Widow finds herself in p[lunged into her sister's business, played by recent Oscar nominee Florence Pugh, another former member of the Black Widows (an elite, clandestine killsquad consisting of women who have been betrayed by life in some form or another) who has been freed by a vial of red mist which breaks the choke-hold their controller, played by Ray Winstone, has on them so when Pugh gains a packet of these vials, she mails it to ScarJo's current safehouse which activates the Taskmaster, a fighter who can mimic another's moves (seen at first cramming her moves via TV) which Scarjo escapes w/the goods reuniting w/her long lost sister (not her actual sister or family for that matter as evidenced by the opening prologue) who both resolve to take out Winstone (w/added help from their pseudo ma & pa, played by Rachel Weisz & David Harbour) as they track down his elusive lair. A solid actioner (some have opined it feels like Captain America: The Winter Soldier lite) which feels more of an obligation than something organic still manages to entertain beside itself since the only MCU product that's been seen has been the Disney + offerings so anything on the big black screen would be viewed almost as a rite of release than anything else. Pugh & Harvour manage to steal almost every scene they're in while Scarjo's cutaways have a 'this is my family' shrug to them but being this is essentially a sacrificial lamb for the Mouse House to see how their big performers will do in our current Covid nation, we could do worse (live action Mulan, anyone?). William Hurt returns again playing 'Thunderbolt' Ross & Olga Kurylenko (from Quantum of Solace & the misbegotten big screen Max Payne) plays the Taskmaster."
1171,8,"the family story I love the storyline. When it comes to the family story, I always couldn't take it. I felt a lot pain from the fighting scenes."
1172,8,"A good movie, but the time it was released really hurt it. Overall, this was a good movie. There was plenty of action, but there was also plenty of character development.The one mistake that Marvel made that really hurt this movie is the timing. This movie is NOT a prequel/origin story, it is a character supplement that should have been released in theaters before Infinity War was released--but don't worry, it doesn't spoil anything about Infinity War and beyond. If anything, it does explain some of Natasha's motivations throughout the rest of the timeline through End Game. People expected a prequel/origin story, but this movie wasn't really either of those. That isn't bad, but Hollywood keeps making the same mistake with prequel/origin story style movies over and over again. A good movie(s) is released, people love the characters, and the bits and pieces of each character develop a preconceived idea with the audience of what any prequel/origin story should be like. Once the studio releases the movie, people are often disappointed because it strays away from how a character is portrayed to the audience. Now in the case of Black Widow, this isn't really a major problem, but the studios probably could have advertised this movie a bit different to avoid the prequel/origin story syndrome that plagues most popular films.The movie is about 10% backstory of how Natasha was indoctrinated into the Red Room, and the rest of the movie is about Natasha looking to set things right from her past. You'll get some exposition here and there to help fill in some blanks, and that is all that is really needed for the storyline. To be frank, I honestly don't think the finer details of the Red Room and Natasha's actual training needed to be filmed or explained in great detail--and the studio made the right decision in that aspect. What happened to her during her training, as told in the other movies, is enough to paint the picture of just how brutal and inhumane her life was. There's no need to dig into that. If you can't appreciate a character story without seeing a bunch of gore and disgusting treatment, then this movie isn't for you.I would recommend this movie to those that haven't seen Infinity War and End Game yet. I would recommend watching this before those as it really does add to the continuity and Natasha's character overall."
1173,6,Meh I wanted to like but just couldn't get into it. First half was good then turns so slow. And I hate to say it but I thought the performance by Florence Pugh was better than Scarlettes. And she is also beautiful.
1174,4,"Watchable If they are charging you on top of what you already pay, it should be better than watchable. They had 2 hours to convey heart and soul on the Marvel character that we should be best able to relate to because, well she was not a god for starters.So many things happened that you think ""why would they do that?"" and not in a comic book they are superheroes kind of way. Just what were they thinking?This is a bit of a spoiler but it applies to everything else wrong about this film and it gives away nothing of the plot. There is not A Black Widow. They really diluted the character. It doesn't matter that it follows the same path as dumping the old, in with the new. Probably the main point of this movie so Mission Accomplished!Wife gave it a 5, I gave it a 4. When I told her I gave it a 4 she changed to a 4 too. This wasn't even girl power."
1175,7,Florence Pugh to the rescue If it weren't for Florence Pugh and David H. The movie would have been much duller.They definitely carries it.
1176,1,"Couldn't finish it Too boring, had more fun staring at my wall half the movie."
1177,4,"Not worth the wait To describe this movie in a sentence is easy, it's Marvel's version of the Fast and the Furious. It adds nothing to the MCU and was a quick money grab to keep the Marvel money train going. I rewatched this movie to really comb through every scene and every minute just disappointed me even more. The only good thing about this movie is the Red Guardian character, but that's overshadowed by Disney's criminal decision to charge you extra to watch this subpar piece of work. Do not waste your time with this one."
1178,9,"Great marvel movie ... don't listen to the movie ""critics"" The action was great for a marvel movie. It wasn't predictable, had interesting characters and a fun story."
1179,5,"Meh Meh. Good, not great. I absolutely cannot believe no one else is talking about how bad Pugh and Harbour's accents were. So nearly ruined it for me. Johnansson and the action were fine. Plot was okay."
1180,4,"Weak A very generic and forgettable movie. Black Widow presents a terrible outcome for the character of Scarlett Johansson and totally bad and forgettable villains. The Trainer was MASSACRED to the extreme by the script and reduced to an ""Exterminator"" project. The script is very punctured and very weak. Crisp cuts and a very shallow and very forgettable soundtrack, like most Marvel movies. The second arc is totally sluggish and slow, getting tedious to watch. The third act is totally messed up and the Plot involving the Trainer's revelation gets to be pathetic and horrible, which makes him one of the worst villains in the cinematographic universe of Marvel. The final CGI is pretty bad. But, the film has mostly good visual decisions, an in-depth look at Natasha and Yelena and great action scenes, as well as being well-placed in the context between Civil War and Infinite War. Unfortunately, other characters like the Red Guardian are very poorly explored and show a horrible development, in addition to excessive cuts in some action scenes and continuity of the same. The feeling when you finish watching, is that you just watched another clichéd Marvel movie and a worse version of ""The Winter Soldier"".Film viewed on July 24, 2021."
1181,8,"The best Marvel movie for quite some time. Finally we are back to superhero movies that are not pretentious, and trying to be 'serious cinema'.This didn't take itself too seriously, and apart from the slightly over the top final scene, it was just good fun all the way through."
1182,7,"Marvel does James Bond! and an overdue sendoff for Black Widow I managed to see this on an IMAX screen and I think generally it was worth it. Big scenery and big action need a big stage. I see that on the IMDb rating scale, female viewers give it a 7.5, almost a full point higher than the male viewers, and I don't have any problem siding with the women. On screen, they're the ones who get almost all the action (including the expected confrontation with a whole room full of Red Room trainees).It must have been frustrating for Scarlett Johansson, who's a good actor, to have seen her Black Widow character treated so inconsistently in the MCU. In the previous Avengers, Iron Man, and Captain America films first she's a SHIELD deep-cover operative in Stark Industries, then a former spy coupled with Hawkeye, then on the run with Steve Rogers, then a love interest with Bruce Banner, then the one keeping the lights on at Avengers headquarters post-Snap, and finally the one to make the ultimate sacrifice so that the Big Guys can save the universe. So this film is long overdue -- the Marvel Studios suits really don't have any excuse for stalling this long to make a female-centered superhero movie (the first one being Captain Marvel, but that was already TEN YEARS after The Guys had the field all to themselves). Black Widow should have had a setup pre-Avengers film just like Tony Stark, Cap, Thor, or Hulk. This film gives Natasha much of the backstory she deserves along with a good-if-not-great standalone adventure.So the basic model for this Black Widow solo is a James Bond style film. Fair enough -- her character isn't superpowered, she was trained as a spy,and there's lots of international intrigue, so it matches well enough. Just like any Bond film, it's a thin cover for scenery-hopping, lots of hand-to-hand combat, guns, cars, motorcycles, aircraft, and over-the-top stunts. There's all of that you might want and the production values are high. The added value is to see Natasha in the context of her adopted ""family"" of former Russian spies (sister, father, mother played by Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz). Their interactions are fun and I think the movie would have improved with a bit more of that and a bit less of the stuntwork. Beyond those central four players, unfortunately there are just stock villains and side characters. Ray Winstone's role as the slimy bad guy behind the Red Room operation never gets beyond one-dimensional. Florence Pugh does well -- and looking ahead, she'll be in the Hawkeye limited series later this year -- though physically she doesn't quite have the stature that Johansson does for this type of role.Scene-by-scene, Black Widow is very involving to watch, even if you don't know all the previous MCU history. But when you think about it later, it kind of disconnects into a bunch of set pieces that don't fit very smoothly. Why exactly did we jump to Morocco? Budapest? Then somewhere in Russia? Finally the famous Red Room turns out to be a fortress in the clouds, I guess because why not. It goes smash so much better that way at the end. Also we watch Natasha go through cycle after cycle of taking (and dishing out) ferocious punishment and keep on ticking. At the end she isn't even limping a bit. So it's action fulfilment for the devout fans, but I don't think scaling it down just a little bit would have done any harm.And about the post-credits scene: well done at the start, but then took a jarring sideways turn that left a bad taste in my mouth. It really broke the mood that the whole movie had worked to establish."
1183,2,Scary bad Just effects on effects on effects. Bad effects. No story. Look at your wall instead.
1184,4,"This movie was garbage I didn't care enough to write a review at the opening day but it's 2 weeks later. The way marvel hyped this movie up on social media so annoying because it's one of the worst marvel movies. There wasn't enough of Res Guardian, the red room plot was a mess, how did dreykovs daughter survive that explosion and become taskmaster???? They ruined taskmaster, the writers were probably not in their right minds when they were writing the script and why weren't yelena and Alexie not included in the plan? I have lots of problems with this movie I'm not going to rate them all because they're is just simply too much. Hope you have a good day."
1185,7,"Great film This was (again with Marvel) exactly what I needed: something different, but still a Marvel film.I really like the dynamic between the characters, it felt real.On a film level, however, I felt misjudged. The callbacks to earlier parts in the movie struck me wrong: they were so emphasized that i felt like the fiommakers thought i was stupid: I, no, wé aren't stupid! The audience knows!Aside from that the film fell apart in the end bc it was too Marvel-y (you'll understand when you watch it, maybe you like it (I didn't).The cast was great and their acting even better, cried once so that's always a + (although I always feel like the filmmakers try a little to hard later in the movie, I had the same problem with the newer animated Disney films).I do stil wholeheartedly recommend it!"
1186,10,"Great film After reading some negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised it was very good."
1187,5,"Noting spectacular This movie is, really, a disappointment. Recorded in, what.. 10 world-wide locations or so - it just shows the big budget.Okay, we get it.Your studio is now massive, you have coins to move mountains, and you have to show everyone exactly that!But... You have lost your soul. The story is poorly connected and scarce. You have an Avenger who is all alone in the world, and has no one to help her. You could have brought someone from the crew to, you know.. at least give her a pet on the shoulder.You really made this movie stand-alone, and I dont think that was Stan Lee's vision. He created the Marvel universe mutually interconnected and homogeneous.I am a big Marvel fan, and I am disappointed. You lost it."
1188,5,"Thanks to the actresses I wonder how much money was wasted on this film, probably enough to feed the hungry in one country alone. Cheesey in parts formulaic in most. Frances Pugh, Scarlett Johansson and Rachel Weisz carried this badly written story, that had so much Cgi it had a Tombraider game feel.Ray Winstone's part was written from some 6 yr old's comic, and unlike the women, he didnt carry it off. I'm sure the pay was worth it, hopefully between Frances and the other two, they can put their money behind a beter script next time."
1189,6,"Black Widow - Review I received exactly what I expected I'll receive. The first half is actually a pretty enjoyable ride with an excellent prologue. The prologue very effectively showcases the situation and the execution of the whole scene is very good. The dialogues among the members of the family are nice and the new characters are just fine, especially David Harbour as The Red Guardian. Taskmaster is a pretty boring villain and the reveal was ok. Overall pretty ok experience, just the filler between the MCU movies. Just the preparation for the real deal."
1190,8,"Black widow Black Widow 2021 12A Director: Cate Shortland Starring: Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel Weisz, Ray Winstone, Ever Anderson, Violet McGraw, O-T Fagbenie, William Hurt, Olga Kurylenko etc Black Widow is about Natasha Romanoff, as she confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Black widow was a fantastic film, it was definitely more flawed than a lot of marvel films, but I still enjoyed myself a lot.My first few positives for black widow would be the fantastic cinematography and action. The great character background, the fantastic chemistry between the cast as well as the great family dynamic. As expected with the MCU the cinematography and attention to detail with its visuals was excellent. It was beautifully and professionally shot. With excellent uses of red to reflect the tone of the film well as well as the characters. I also liked the visual imagery to represent key stages of Natasha's life and how they were repeated during different scenes. The action was also fantastic. It was thrilling, exciting and excellently choreographed, also a lot more gritty and hard hitting than a lot of previous MCU movies which I appreciated. I also really appreciated the character background. The opening scene set up Natasha and her family well. Establishing her life prior to the avengers, it was interesting to finally see how Natasha was growing up as a child so this was a nice element to the film. I also loved the fantastic family dynamic and the chemistry between the cast. This was definitely one of the strongest elements of the film for me. The whole family dynamic was so believable and fun. They came across as a genuine albeit unconventional family that needed to patch things up. Scarlett, Florence, David and Rachel all did fantastic jobs here and there on-screen chemistry was excellent. Especially Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh who worked so well together here, there sister bond was excellently written and Florence is a deserving replacement for Natasha.My next few positives would be the building of tension. Darker themes, great worldbuilding and character depth. As well as great performances and comedic dialogue. I thought the film managed to build tension very well, this was largely due to the much darker themes for Marvel. The opening scenes and the amount of detail they went into how they trained the Widows and how they separated them from their families was surprisingly tough to watch, and as I learned more about the widows the tension increased amazingly with the villain behind it all as well as the action. I thought the worldbuilding was also great, it filled in a few holes within the timeline of the movies as well as Natasha's character. Building on the red room and Natasha's dark past was well explored. Therefore, the film had strong character depth. As we discovered Natasha's dark past and her regrets, as well as trying to get to the bottom of who her true family was it gave the needed depth to her character that was missing from some of the previous entries within the MCU therefore making this standalone feature for me worth people's time in terms of learning more about her character. I also appreciated the depth they gave to Yelena (Florence Pugh) as well, her being free of the mind control of the widows was a really interesting element, and just sad to see her go into so much detail about the widow's lack of freedom and having so many things taken away from them. The performances here were great the main 4 cast members were fantastic. Scarlet Johansson was brilliant, she bought the grounded and passionate performance expected from the character of Natasha and she didn't disappoint. Rachel Weisz was also fantastic showing she can hang with the younger cast members well. David Harbour was brilliant, his comedic timing was excellent and Red Guardian was a great character. What helped was the excellent comedic writing for his character, it was witty, well timed, and genuinely funny and David just made it work. But the star of the film was Florence Pugh. Wow what a star making performance. She delivered in every aspect needed. She delivered in the action, the more serious and emotional side to her character. But she also bought this fresh humour to the film and had some excellent moments.However, the film was far from perfect. My negatives for Black Widow would be the rushed scenes, underused villains, lack of detail to the deeper themes. As well as the off-putting CGI in the final act. There were certain scenes that needed more explanation and more time to breathe, considering how detrimental they were to the whole film, there was just certain scenes involving the widows and how to free them that felt glossed over and lacked attention. I also thought that the villains were extremely underused. Despite some good explanation, the main villain was mediocre for the MCU and didn't have enough presence within the film to leave a lasting impact. There was a similar issue with Taskmaster as well, it felt like a missed opportunity with that character so hopefully she is bought back. I also thought that there was a lack of depth to the bigger themes. I felt like the film introduced the darker themes really well, but then never really went into any more detail with them, so therefore the films bigger messages were lost within the action. Finally, I thought the CGI in the final act was very off putting In places. There were just certain scenes that had badly done CGI involving characters faces. And CGI and green screen was overused for when the Red room was destroyed, as I wasn't a particularly big fan of the flying action scene.My final few positives would be the decent villain, explanation to the villain. The plot twists, the great character conflict and tone. As well as the great final act. Despite the villain overall being mediocre, I did appreciate his role within the film. I think Ray Winstone did a solid performance for the character to come across as intimidating and threatening, as well as being instantly dislikeable due to his treatment of the widows. I also liked the explanation and twists with his character. The background with his daughter being killed was a good motivation for his character and was well linked with Natasha's backstory. The twist with taskmaster was also well executed in my opinion and was a plot twist I didn't see coming. I also really liked the character conflict. The tension between Natasha and the villain and the conflict due to Natasha escaping the red room before was great. I also appreciated the conflict with the family, due to there troubled past and giving Natasha and Yelena away but not knowing where. Introduced some good conflict that was well explored and drew them all closer as a family. I also thought the film managed to execute a fantastic tone, switching between its more serious and emotional tone to its comedic tone very well. I also loved the spy espionage feel to it, fitting with the character of Natasha excellently. Finally, I thought the final act was great. Despite my issues with some of the action. It was thrilling, entertaining and gave Natasha and Yelena the closure they needed for there characters. The end credit scene was also excellent. Setting up Yelena's MCU future excellently.Overall, Black Widow misses the mark slightly with the villains and the deeper themes are lost within the action. But it is still and incredibly entertaining, intense and strong addition to the MCU Serving as both respect to Scarlet and what she has done with the character of Natasha, whilst also introducing us to the new phase of heroes with Yelena, with a star making performance from Florence Pugh.Overall rating 84/100."
1191,10,"Stunning! The movie we deserved in so long. Great story, great acting."
1192,7,"Enjoyable but should have been made before infinity war. Black widow was definitely an enjoyable film with stellar performances from both Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh along with some thrilling action sequences. HOWEVER, there was no point of this movie apart from introducing the other 3 characters. Taskmaster's character was a disappointment and was only enjoyable to watch during the fight scenes. Also the movie could have had more impact if it was made before infinity war as it feels outdated and pointless to watch a movie centered around a character that no longer exists in the MCU.To sum up, Black widow is a typical marvel movie which is enjoyable, yet forgettable. Great enough for a one time watch."
1193,7,"7/10 Great movie! Great movie! Great performances all around, well worth the wait."
1194,4,"Underwhelming Black widow gets an underwhelming solo movie where her story is overshadowed by the introduction of her sister, who will undoubtedly take up her mantle in the upcoming MCU.A mediocre villain without realistic intentions and a CGI fest of an ending provide for an unsatisfying visit to her origin, which leaves you wondering if this was the best story for Marvel to tell.Entertaining action and a charismatic cast are the only things that save this movie from being completely unwatchable."
1195,4,EASY PEASY...AND EASY Why is everyone so good (not in a good way). But for the widow its very easy to get what she want that viewer easily get to know that everything thing is fake.
1196,1,Boring ZZZzzzz Space jam 2 better. So I have to keep typing cuz my review is too short.
1197,8,"Good It's the first MCU movie that we can watch after 2-year-pause. It was like a breath of fresh air. But also it has some boring moments.Firstly, the plot shows us the typical Marvel story with non-remarkable villian.Secondly, the cast is great, Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh has perfect duet. Also I like David Harbour as Red Guardian.Thirdly, the visual effects are awesome as always.So, it's typical MCU film."
1198,1,"Not good It felt more like a feminist propaganda movie than an action movie, the family elements were okay but a tad slow, the rest was just meh. There is no excuse this day and age for women to prove anything, we are equal, stop pushing it in people's faces."
1199,3,"does not deserve the high score. Def. one of the worst movies in MCU universe. Disgrace storyline, cheap filming, movie is rushed, too many cliché, bad acting and many more."
1200,5,"Not my demographic Screen time spent on scenes that removed me from the experience, and I began to muse it was a made-for-television episode.I felt like it was aimed at some target demographic that wasn't me, so I came here to see if it appealed to a daytime soap audience, and discovered the general reviews and score seem to indicate that at best it appealed to a small percentage of viewers."
1201,4,when they showed the Task master identity it ruined the movie Well first of all this movie was not necessary in the MCU and then the director was very bad at her work the action scenes were very short overall not a good movie .
1202,3,"Could of and should of been so much better. It took me three attempts over three nights to get through this. Story...dull and predictable. Acting...Oh dear, not good, especially the accents ( Pugh's especially) CGI...over the top and not that great.The so called humour in this film just felt miss placed and clumsy, almost an after thought.Still better than Wonder Woman 84 though...just!!!!"
1203,10,CRAZY GOOD Don't know why people are saying it sucks i really get bored easily and it wasn't boring at all i really loved it !
1204,6,Taskmaster = ruined Stop forcing characters to fit a story and start making the story fit the characters.
1205,6,"I was disappointed. The character and Scarlett deserved more She took some falls that were just way too unbelievable to not at least suffer a bruise. Black Widow's origin and her motivation to be doing the work that she is doing. I expected the movie will focus on the Black Widow Instead what I got is a lazy and pointless movie which focused more on her sister than Black Widow which the movie is supposed to be about. It was not a bad movie but it was a Yelena movie. I guess Black Widow will never have her own movie no matter what. The worst part is she was cooler in the avengers' movies. The fight, the driving, the smart and the feeling she projected were not as great. For Yelena however it was mind blowing. It feels like they tried to uncool her in order to make us like Yelena more because she will replace her as the new Widow. The movie feels too much like a Fast and Furious to me. A lot of family talk, stunts and jokes, Government agencies, explosions, car chases and FAMILY. The reason this movie was created was because of the end credits scene."
1206,7,"Bridge It wasn't as fulfilling as i hoped it filled some plot holes and thats it,its a bridge to the hawkeye series."
1207,6,Too much hate You can't expect everything to be exactly comic book accurate. I thought the movie was enjoyable and another fun marvel movie. I think it sets up Hawkeye pretty well and more story lines to come.
1208,3,"grade D for boring mind control garbage Save your time and money. How does a vial of random red serum break chip installed mind-controlled women? The much-talked about Red Room was just a quick scene already shown in many trailers. It was mentioned every 10 minutes and in the end, everybody just ran out of it.Natasha's ""sister"" Yelena was a nice surprise and added a sweet sense of humor to this movie. If you cut out everything with Alexi in it, this movie's plot could have moved without him."
1209,7,"You guys are nuts! Wow I have read some of the reviews here and gotta say you guys are nuts!You cant even tell your own name without gagging on camera and saying this movie sucks?Get a life , movie was good and I normally got bored quite easily!Come to your senses! Watching the movie from your small screens in your small rental houses and putting negative comments to good movies!You dont know anything about cinema and talking about it all the time ,how cute."
1210,6,"One of the weaker Marvel entries, unfortunately So... Florence Pugh is really cool!For those who have been paying attention for a while now, that shouldn't come as a surprise, but this being my main take-away from this movie is rather sad.Black Widow deserved a better entry. She's been kicking ass ever since Iron Man 2, and became a bit of a fan favorite. This movie is a perfect example of too little, too late. We've already seen some of her origin story scattered among other entries in the MCU, and then End Game happened, which was a rather definitive ending to the story arc of the original Avengers. But they promised us a Black Widow movie, so here it is I guess.Pro's: Action's done quite well, they take time to introduce the characters and as I said earlier Pugh's awesome.Con's: No real character arc for Black Widow in her own movie, supporting cast of Harbour and Weisz underused, the plot isn't very interesting, underwhelming finale.This one's hard to recommend. I had an okay time watching it, and it's competently enough made, but it doesn't have many selling points. And if you want more Florence Pugh, there's the new Little Women movie, which is a much stronger flick.Okay movie. Nothing more. Reluctant 6/10."
1211,9,"Why all the bad reviews? I've read some of the reviews and majorities were really bad. Their expectations were so high because they're expecting like ""iron-man"" kinda movie. This movie is good, it's emotional, (Knowing that she died in End Game) that she has to go through all that. It was fun because of ""Red Guardian"", although some scenes were cringe but overall it's good."
1212,7,"SCARLETT FEVER The Marvel Universe is reeling. Well, the feverish fans are. Instead of the usual endless chock a block CGI army battles the Avengers series suffers from, ""Black Widow"" concentrates more on back story, comedic touches and a healthy dose of James Bondish intrigue. Heck, they even pay proper homage by having Roger Moore as 007 on the telly in an opening sequence. Bravo!That means less cataclysmic explosions, and no destruction of civilizations. Less is more. Less destruction, but still plenty on a more psychological level, if you get the drift. We even have Ray Winstone as a deliciously sleazy Bond type villain, slurping his salacious world domination lines. Where's the white pussy? Black Widow is more acrobat and firearm expert than sheHulk, and thus the action has to be paired down to almost reasonable levels, where agility and smarts will win the day. Cool.Yet alas, this is Marvel, and thus there are issues. These are not really films, they are entertainment vehicles that fill a coupla hours with fantasy escapism. Accents come and go. Continuity seems like a costly premium. Bone crushing blows are quickly brushed off. Bad dudesses come crashing through the ceiling for no apparent reason other than it is super cool. This is action Hollywood damn it, do not question reason! You know the score. And yes, there is some crazy CGI explosive awesomeness for the comic book diehards. Thankfully ""Black Widow"" is entertaining enough to gloss over the silliness; it is quite easy to sit back with a giant bag of popcorn and eat it all up.Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the sexy (yet asexual), clever and self-effacing lead, martial arting her way through robotic foes (one at a time of course), and handling a motorbike through ridiculous traffic like, well, you know who.As a nice bonus David Harbour playing the bad father and failed super hero, threatens to steal the movie, but he is discretely inserted for just the right amount of kicks. The ideal supporting character, part of an insistent dysfunctional family reunion that gives our heroine a muddled history tree to trim as she attempts to save the world while sorting out some family strife."
1213,8,"Really enjoyed this one It's been a while since I've last watched a Marvel movie and really enjoyed watching one again. I see quite some people leaving some bad reviews, but I myself really enjoyed this movie.Great story, awesome characters and the post-credit scene was cool too.Obviously not the best movie, but for me it's definitely high up!"
1214,1,very disappointed This movie should be around scarlet Johannes personality and viewers would be connected to the movie but exact opposite ... this movie will fail that goal and definitely disappoint you..
1215,9,"So great movie full on action Really disappointed to read reviews, but don't fall for it people taste is gone to hell. Love the movie and story line is totally awesome."
1216,5,Lacks believability even for a comic book movie Incredible stunts & effects but a silly storyline with plot points & sequences that lack believability even for a comic book movie.
1217,3,"Disappointing to say the least The film is bland, it's just blockbuster cheese. The film was a blatant copy of both atomic blonde and red sparrow."
1218,1,This is a joke in the name of movie I can't believe I've wasted a good chunk of time waiting for this to release.
1219,7,"Lame This it happens when u have high expectations, it was bad to average. Such a waste of good CGI."
1220,4,Did someone invite DC? This felt as pitiful as WW84 did. Complete disrespect to the heroine and the villain. MCU's first rotten one since they started this.
1221,7,"Worth the wait Shortly after the events of Civil War, Natasha(Johansson, yet again nailing the ""carrying the weight of all the awful things she did before reforming"", which here is made one of the primary themes, along with how found family can help process pain, especially if it is a shared experience) meets back up with the three people (none of whom are actually related by blood) she shared (what little she had of) her childhood with: sister Yelena(Pugh, delivering several, perhaps more than any other one performer, of the many emotional gut punches), mother Melina(Weisz, applying her substantial brains to the situation) and father Alexei(Harbour, both legitimately trying to be parental figures, and occasionally really getting it right), to once and for all accomplish what Romanoff honestly believed she head done decades ago: Kill the evil General Dreykov(Winstone, as usual being deeply compelling as a vicious individual, here a misogynist), and destroy the Red Room, where all Black Widows are broken down, trained, and stripped of any individuality.Obviously, it would have been even better if this had come out years ago. Actually, with a little rewriting, this could easily have come out an entire decade ago. Regardless of any other aspect, the fact that this stars a woman in the titular role has had people saying for years that it would automatically be bad. It's hard to argue that this would have come out upwards of 10 years ago, if not for that one aspect. I think a lot of people would have, and many, I'm sure, did, advise that it not rock the boat any more than that. So it's hard for me to overstate my relief and joy at finding that the movie is unapologetically feminist. It uses the spy training, which includes kidnapping girls when they are children, to explore trauma caused by men against women(obviously, the specifics of what they experience is extremely rare, and the details are hard to relate to. But the notion that some people, if not stopped, are simply going to keep hurting any female they can, really resonates). Ultimately, it could go even further. And it definitely would have been able to go deeper, if not for the trusted MCU formula demanding frequent action scenes. Thankfully, immensely talented director Cate Shortland does what she can (and that's a lot) to keep those scenes as intense and impactful as possible, by keeping the camera close, letting us feel every blow. There are some issues with the pacing and editing, that are most likely down to the movie not being completely done shooting before Corona restrictions were put in place, and a reluctance by the studio to postpone release until those rules were lifted. A decision which, honestly, is completely understandable. I won't spend long talking about Taskmaster, other than to say that, given what they clearly wanted to do there, they should simply have come up with a new character, or picked one that actually suited their needs, since now, they have frustrated(when that wasn't necessary or intentional at all) many who hoped for a more direct interpretation, and now merely distracts from a powerful and carefully thought-out depiction(as far as the ideas that this is exploring, they got it 100-percent spot-on).A little visible blood, and lasting wounds, push the PG-13 rating. I recommend this to any fan of Scarlett, her depiction of the role, of spy thrillers, and of comic book adaptations. 7/10."
1222,4,"Too little, too late, too convoluted. LONG overdue, but fizzles. The 1st half of the film looks amazing - we have Cate Shortland to thank for that. Then Black Widow takes a back seat in her own film for - I must admit charming - Red Guardian & Yelena. Blofeld's plan from On Her Majesty's Secret Service is recycled here, then the CGI food fight begins! Not a great swan song for such a beloved Marvel character, more of an off pitch duck."
1223,8,"Don't believe the nay-sayers! There appears to be a campaign of misleading negative reviews on this movie, made obvious by the blatant lies (eg. ""too much CGI"", which is just complete BS). Loved the performances and direction - it manages to be moving and way less impenetrable than some of the previous Marvel films, which absolutely HAVE suffered from CGI-overload."
1224,6,"Better as a series Great cast, interesting story, Florence Pugh steals the movie. I, like so many others have been waiting for a Black Widow film. I enjoyed it, but with so many character introductions and a rich backstory for our characters that we only scratch the surface of, it feels incomplete. This would've been better as a limited series (Falcon & the Winter Soldier, Wandavision)"
1225,4,"Disappointing When Black Widow was first announced, and the first trailer dropped, I had hopes that this film could be Winter Soldier esq. Maybe not as masterful as Winter Soldier, but the vibe of it, and that it would have top 12 MCU movie potential. However, that was definitely not the case. It's called ""Black Widow"" and meant to be a send off for Scar Jo as Nat, but it instead feels more so like an introduction for Florence as Yelena (who was the bright spot of this movie for me along with Red Guardian to a lesser extent). The battles I found underwhelming for the most part, the pacing was inconsistent, and the plot wasn't all that great to me.Finally, the biggest catastrophe of this movie, ""Taskmaster"". I put quotations because I refuse to believe this is THE Taskmaster, and that it's simply some person under the name since they mentioned ""Taskmaster protocol"". It's not even the fact they gender swapped Taskmaster (although I'm not the biggest fan of that either, especially after finding out the stunt double was a man so what was the point?) but I find ""Taskmaster"" very poorly written. The abilities didn't even come naturally, it was more so driven by technology via the visor/chip as opposed to photographic reflexes. With how different the character felt, they would've been better off just making an original character as opposed to changing so much of his core characteristics in source material. I'm going to hold out hope this is another Mandarin situation where they introduce a REAL Taskmaster down the road.All in all, very average Marvel movie, and honestly probably a bit below average. I'd put it in my bottom 5 MCU movies."
1226,9,"Great movie shame it took so long to get here Great movie typical MCU with a black widow twist. Fun to watch with surprises and great fight scenes. It fills all the gaps with the black widow character. Not sure why people gave it a bad rating. I enjoyed it and looking forward to more MCU movies. Where is the Hawkeye movie for his disturbing time after the blip happened. Each main character needs to have their own movie not just tv series. Looking forward to the Hawkeye series and what's next for Falcon & Winter Soldier. Keep it coming MCU and stop making us wait too long for the next MCU movie, the actors and I are not getting any younger.Signed big MCU fan from New Zealand."
1227,7,"It diddn't blow my socks off, but it was a good movie nonetheless. I'm a huge Marvel fan. I usually see every one of the movies in there debut. This was first ever exception. There was just so many mixed reviews. I honestly just avoided seeing it for little. Upon conclusion however I personally felt it was good movie although there were things I diddn't like.First I felt the film almost lacked superhero feel. The movie played as more of Mission Impossible. With the plane jumping, explosions, car chases, etc. Also contributing to that was the super villian Taskmaster was severly under-utilized and lackluster. Secondly I diddn't really enjoy the entire family dynamic at all and felt at times it was cheesy and if anything detracted more from Black Widows story then it helped the movie along.With that said though I did think the visuals and sound effects in this movie were out of this world. I thought Scarlett Johansson continued her role of Black Widow very well. Also I found the movies pacing to be good especially for 2 hours I felt it breezed by and did enough to keep audience entertained without ever feeling draggy at all.Would I rewatch the movie ever again? Most likely not to be honest. Would I recommend it to others? I would say absolutely its worth a watch, but mainly to Marvel fans. The movie can be little confusing to those who haven't seen the prior films."
1228,7,"Black Widow Is Still A Supporting Character! So I'm a massive Marvel fan and I always watch their films as soon as possible. But when it came to Black Widow I put it off for a week and I don't even feel bad about it.Scarlett Johansson's black widow is still just a supporting character. Florence's character Yelena on the other hand actually got me cracking up at parts. Overall the acting was pretty good all round but the best acting I would say came from David Harbour & Florence Pugh(Thou I may be slightly biased here as I really like the actress xD)The storyline was honestly the weakest I've come across in a marvel movie and the villain was just boring. Like seriously it was just so boring listening to him talk or just basically any scene with the villain in it. The fake family and their drama was more entertaining to watch in all honesty. I miss when MCU villains were of the caliber of Loki, Thanos etc.All in all, I give Black Widow a 7/10. Without David Harbour and Florence Pugh I would probably rate it a 4 or 5 out of 10.I still did enjoy the film but it didn't have me wanting more with the appetite I normally have around marvel movies. One of the things I was most hyped to see in the film was what happened in Budapest between Barton and Natasha but it turns out it was just another shoot out... nothing really special really...Anyway I think the director's inexperience and lack of marvel know how is what caused a lot of the problems. Yelena seems cool though and I'll probably watch out for her future appearances if only to see if she is wearing a sexy outfit 😂."
1229,1,"It's Adequate I thought the movie was complete nonsense and quite unbelievable.The premise is not well explained.Also, this movie must not be a stand alone. Seems like if you have not religiously watched some other relevant MCU movie, the plot is almost meaningless.Not much acting involved, it is almost all stunts and visual effects. I have never seen something take as long to fall to the ground as the Red Room, which was supposedly well hidden because it was in the sky...makes perfect sense.If you have to see this movie, you should pay as little as possible to do so."
1230,6,"Not a classic mcu but pretty good I was really looking forward to seeing this film as the black widow incarnation in the mcu is impressive.So why was I disappointed with it ?Fight scenes where well choreographed, With just the right amount of humour throughout, some good casting with plenty of stars.However that said the movie seemed to spiral out of control after about 90 minutes in to a homage to an 80s bond esque movie with way over the top bad guys/girls bent on world domination, with improbable sets with good guys having minutes to escape impending doom, to finish with humorous finally."
1231,8,Good overly hyped Honestly I've been waiting for this movie sense infinity war but it was not really set around finding out about Nats past and stuff but more around yelena it was good but overly hyped.
1232,4,"Not as expected The start was good with great beginning, but after that the movie story and action are not strong enough, the villain will have no strong appearance, I was not convinced by the reason they are fighting for. The good thing was when the comedy starts to show up."
1233,9,"A better-than-expected prequel. I don't know what I can add to all the other favorable reviews already posted, here. But, I'll do my best.First off; the prologue took me completely by surprise. I had no idea that small-town ""American"" family were actually Russian spies till they actually started speaking Russian! David Harbour was particularly convincing as the Red Guardian. A man developed as the Soviet Union's Capt. America. But. Unable to prove it during Cap's icy incarceration. So, his talents were ""wasted"" on a long-term undercover assignment.Then, comes the flash-forward where we see Scarlet Johannson, as grown-up Natasha Romanov, on the run from SHIELD for violating what I sarcastically call the ""Short Leash Accords"" enacted by the United Nations in the wake of CAPT. AMERICA: CIVIL WAR.Enter Florence Pugh as Yelena, one-time ""foster"" sister of the Black Widow. She tells BW about how their ex-KGB handler has gone power-mad. Intending to start a new wave of international terrorism using hundreds of brainwashed young women agents!The attempt to stop him involves breaking the Red Guardian out of prison so they can reunite with their one-time ""foster"" mother Melina (Rachel Weisz of CHAIN REACTION and MUMMY fame). The only scientist smart enough to neutralize that brainwashing.The fight scenes and special visual effects dominate, of course, as is to be expected in any superhero movie. But, what's made Marvel Films a little more successful at it than, say, their Distinguished Competitor is the way the former emphasize the human side of being superhuman.For example; the way Natasha and Yelena argue (in a semi-good-natured way) about the almost-seductive way Natasha comes out of her leap-down crouches is almost truly sisterly. With the latter calling the former a ""poser"" almost as if she's jealous! Although, I don't honestly see why she should be.The way her long blonde ponytail waves back and forth, when Yelena emerges from a similar crouch, is almost as hypnotic as watching a stopwatch. ;-)In any event, I loved going to see this movie and I heartily recommend it to everyone else who wants a pleasant, action-packed time-killer this summer. Of course, half of you reading this will no doubt be asking yourselves ""If he liked it so much, why not give it a perfect ten?""The needless feminizing of the Taskmaster. ""Nuff said."""
1234,7,"Pleasantly surprised My pre-watch notes were ""nobody/unaccomplished director and released AFTER the holiday after being delayed three times."" So the bar was low for this, especially given the viewer critiques here. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Good production values, decent action scenes, and comic-relief scattered throughout. Scarlett's ""Natasha"" character was a bit too intense, too serious throughout so that wasn't endearing, however ""Yelena"" was spunky and funny when ribbing Natasha about her action poses, and the ""Red Guardian"" was awkwardly funny throughout, too, so those elements can't be denied. But some elements of the plot towards the end went stupidly implausible and things ended up a little too tidy instead of the mess it should've been which would've led better to any sequel. Final note, the various black widows were colloquially called widows which didn't make good sense since they were more once tiny child orphans (of a sort) than once-married widows, so that piece of backstorying is weak."
1235,1,"Boring Stereotypical Superhero Movie I like superhero movies because usually they have an interesting story. Unfortunately, black widow is not among those movies and most certainly does not worth neither the time or money. The movie was extremely boring with a predictable story and full of cringy dialogues that made the movie successfully exceeds two hours."
1236,6,Yes yes yes and then no no no The movie was like ... cool cool cool yes yes yes and then... boring boring boring and then a few yesses and well. Lots of stereotypes and fluffy trashy small talk. But I truly enjoyed Yelena.
1237,5,"I feel sad.. Im a huge Marvel fan and hate to critizise.. but it is bad. I got a lot of ""Charlies Angels vibe"" out of this movie which could be the worst feeling in the world. The movie is so unrealistic and exaggerated in a bad way. It might be difficult to do a movie based on a superhero with out any actually super powers..?"
1238,4,"Bad Buy far, the worst Marvel movie by now, I wasn't expecting too much anyway."
1239,2,"Russia is the main villain of Marvel I am a Russian viewer of the Marvel universe movie comics. I watched with interest how this fantastic superhero world develops.I was still in high school when I first watched Iron Man. I really loved this movie. I was impressed by Tony Stark's charisma. And the intelligence and resourcefulness of this hero inspired me.So I watched how various new cultures are shown in this movie comic universe. For example, Wakanda impressed me. The mixture of African culture and cutting-edge technologies looks very fresh.The Asian culture of the Marvel universe is filled with mysticism and magic, bordering on the aesthetics of martial arts.And I, as a Russian viewer, wanted to see how Russia or the USSR itself would appear in this universe.So, according to the version of the Marvel universe, Russia is a creepy cold place in which there are only prisons. In Russia, according to Marvel, there are only officials who brainwash people and are obsessed with how to overthrow states all over the planet with the help of young women.There is not one normal character from Russia in the Marvel universe. Natasha Romanoff is a good character because she is a Russian American. Her home is not Russia. Her home is Ohio.I used to like the Marvel universe. I thought that the creators of this universe are tolerant of all nations. But judging by this film, only Russophobes work in Marvel. I'm disappointed in the Marvel universe. I expected that in the first solo film about a superhero from Russia, Russia will be presented in an interesting way. But it all came down to politics."
1240,5,"Nice waste of Task Master character Movie was ok, Yelena nice, Task Master trash. You can delete whole character from movie and nothing will change."
1241,10,"Amazing I don't know why people are saying she was the sidekick Black widow was the star, don't get me wrong I love yelena and she was a great addition but the movie wasn't all about her it was about Nats journey and getting reunited with her family. This is one of my all time fav films in the mcu as I love nat and the end scene just showed us just how much love and chemistry they had as actors and sisters."
1242,4,"Now I understand why Kevin Fiege was hesitant to give Black Widow a solo film until now. I don't know if my expectations were too high considering the movie got an extra year but this movie felt like a rough draft. I wasn't expecting much from this movie either. I was expecting a mediocre plot with some fun action set pieces and a few jokes sprinkled in between. Instead we got a jumbled mess with a boring plot and the titular character wasn't even the star of the movie. I found red guardian, yelena, and the mother much better characters in this movie which was shocking considering Scarlet has had over 10 years of experience playing the character, yet she gave by far the worst performance in the whole movie. Now I understand why Marvel was hesitant to give black widow a solo film, she does not command the same screen presence as other characters such as RDJ's Ironman, or Chris Evan's Captain America. If this is the quality of movie we get from here on out, I am very worried about the future of the MCU. But I am hopeful that this movie is just a miss and not indicative of the future of the franchise."
1243,2,"Just terrible It's on right now, I'm so bored and underwhelmed I am typing whilst the awful script, story no one cares about, and cheap looking cgi chug on in the background. They just didn't even try to make it entertaining."
1244,8,"Interesting Origin Story! I'm surprised I'm reading a lot of negative reviews after watching this film last night!I really enjoyed the fast pace, none stop action and it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I found Natasha's origin story really interesting and Florence Pugh is a great addition to the MCU. I hope to see her in many more films/series to come!All in all a great watch (minus Ray Winstone's Russian accent!)"
1245,6,"To be honest, I got disappointed. After a very long time, we finally got a chance to watch a new Marvel movie. I really missed watching one of Marvel's good superhero movies, especially a hero from the original six, who we haven't seen its film yet. However, I had lost interest in the movie because of the long break, and I did not have many expectations. I thought that it would be a classic and average Marvel movie. Unfortunately, the film was even less than I expected.If we divide the movie into two halves, I would say that the first half satisfied me. Even though there were still things that I didn't like as a whole, which I will come back to them, the first half of the movie had a clear story and goal. Taskmaster was also looking cool and scary; it reminded me of the WinterSoldier. It was what I define as a classic Marvel movie.On the other hand, the second half of the movie lost its focus. Many weird things start to happen one after the other. There were moments (for example, the flashbacks of the original plan) that felt very cliche. The Taskmaster also turned out to be not the guy many of us thought.Now, let's talk about the things that I did not like in general. I think the movie failed to introduce the main bad guy of the film, Dreykov, and the story of BlackWidow. As I told you, I liked the first half. Nevertheless, these things troubled me mainly in the first half. The film has brief scenes that are about the past of BlackWidow and Dreykov (flashbacks that are like a maximum of 5 minutes). I believe that it does not give us the necessary back story of the Red Room. And because the film revolves around those lacked scenes, I just started to not give a damn about what they were talking about and what was happening towards the end. In my opinion, the main reason behind this is that they focused on Yelena and that family issue more than BlackWidow itself. I think they could have reduced some of the dialogue scenes to show us more flashbacks, but still, it wouldn't be enough. It would be much better if they just focused on BlackWidow and the RedRoom. I also think that Natasha is not the same person that we know from the other movies. I believe the reason for this is also because the film is not focused on her. In addition, it would be cooler if Taskmaster was the master of the RedRoom and the main villain of the movie.I normally would have given 5.5, but there isn't such an option, and because of my respect for Marvel itself, I will give 6."
1246,8,"Why so many bad reviews? It was really good. The fight scenes were great! Characters and the story was very interesting even though I knew Natasha's fate in Endgame. It's a great movie that makes you sympathise with the characters and you understand that they have done their best with what they were given in life. Two things I loved the most about this movie are: 1) the fight was against a system and they didn't just defeat one bad guy, they actually freed those girls and their fight did really make a difference; 2) I loved that in the end Natasha is happy and in the Endgame she died knowing she had people who loved her because after so much suffering she deserved that. Overall an interesting watch, was not disappointed."
1247,2,"Disappointing and overrated ! Bad! I was in high hopes but this movie is just arghhhh... fight scenes badly done, script is just bad . Started high and just went downhill. This movie doesn't deserve it's current ratings. I was waiting when it will end.. bored.."
1248,5,It was meh David harbour carried the movie if not him and the. 10 dollars I paid I would of stop watching.
1249,2,"Appalling movie even with suspension of disbelief is in the equation Not exactly sure how would someone with sane mind praise this movie. Even if suspension of disbelief is in the equation, the movie is still as bad as a rotting muffin. Le't see:Please, please, please...speak English. There is no point to speak Hollywood version of Russian in terrible accent. Again, this may not be noticeable for dumb segment of the society.We learned now Natasha can survive falls like Wolverine, but she can't survive injury by banging her head on desk. Perhaps she wouldn't have died in one of the the previous movies if her God mode was on.Why on earth would she come near the villain and risk pheromone lock? Shoot him across the room. Your mama told you what trick the villain got under his sleeves.When did she escape prison or let go once she voluntarily surrendered to the authorities at the end?Why would sisters start fighting? Her sister literally send her vials. The scene looked just out of sync.The family conversation at family meals was cringe worthy, as they were forced by directors to sit together.Why would the sister go after Hawkeye when Natasha sacrificed herself? Wasn't this already known to the world?The Taskmaster in APC carrier waiting for sisters to jump on the bike for escape. Literally applied brakes and waited a few feet away. Have a look at it if you didn't delete the movie yet.Don't get me wrong, this movie is slightly better than Wonder Woman 1984..but still dumb. And I'm surprised Scarlett Johansson didn't object to any of the problems despite being one of the show runners."
1250,4,"It is a film If you enjoy Marvel movies then you will surely enjoy this film! If you do not then you will be sitting in your seat reliving your whole life asking yourself where did it all go wrong? That's how boring the film is, before the film even started there was a advertisement for Black Widow the film I was about to watch. This reminded me of how Disney owns majority of popular franchises and have control of the film industry. There was a opening sequence where they played a altered version of the song ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by artist Kurt Cobain. Hearing this was surreal as Smells Like Teen Spirit was one of there most disliked songs by Kurt Cobain that he made yet they used it. I know why they used it, even though there are better songs which could of worked they could possibly offend someone. Thats why they used the most safe and most popular song of theirs, even if it adds no substance.This can describe the film in itself as it does nothing new and nothing interesting. I just wish that these film will stay on streaming platforms and not cinemas."
1251,1,"WTF did I just watch One of thee most worst MCU movies .I may have given this movie a higher score if it came out 7 years ago but now it just feels purposeless. Lets count the top ten sins of this movie1. The movie starts of with a young Natie and her family but for some reason a little boy is playing a Young Natie. WHY?2. Nat's car is shot with a bazooka but she's fine,Then She gets beaten up by Task Master but she's fine then she gets kicked of a bridge but she's fine WHY?3. Natie fights her Sister Yelena brutally but WHY?4. Natie falls of a 4 story building but she's just fine WHY? Kinda makes you think why she didnt survive the fall in EndGame.5. A long car chase ensues where Nat and Yelena is involved in a brutal motorcycle accident but both are just fine.6. They then get into a horrific car accident but their just fine minor scratches. So by this time im convinced they are both Super Humans.7. All men in this movie is either evil or really stupid and gets put down the hole time.8. The villain is basically Harvey Weinstein and the cant hurt because he smells to good .WHAT?9. The Fake Russian accents at the Dinner Table Scene is so cringy.10. Taskmaster is totally waisted just like The Mandarin in Iron Man 3Bonus 11. Every serious or sad moment is undercut by a stupid jokeOverall the second worst MCU movie just ahead of Captain Marvel."
1252,7,"A fun ride with good acting and too generic evil and action It's generally fun - good amount of humorous situations, with a healthy sarcastic attitude, but also not too much so it's not entirely a comedy. In fact, it's sometimes the quite opposite - the sisters (and the whole ""family"") portray their emotions and attitude to the past quite dramatically and believably, so there's a good deal of drama there. The action in the first 2/3 of the movie is also quite good, while it's limited to fights and less futuristic equipment.What's less amusing IMO is the main villain, the evil plot and the final battle - it's too generic, too made-up and too ""common futuristic fighting scene with heroes gloriously surviving through impossible odds"". Surprisingly dull comparing to the first part of the movie.Overall it's quite good and amusing from (most of) the characters perspective, but has some irritating downsides."
1253,10,"Best marvel movie after endgame 🔥🔥 I did not imagine that the movie would be this wonderful, I did not understand how wonderful it was. I was excited all the time I watched the movie. Thank you, Marvel, for this movie, which I have always been waiting for with its strength after Endgame."
1254,7,"Enjoyable action movie. Average marvel movie. This movie was fun to watch. ScoJo has long deserved her own movie, but unfortunate release timing. It just did not feel like it was the right movie to kick off the new saga. The villain side of the film was underwhelming. I need more from Taskmaster. This movie is a good stand alone film, but fell victim to the MCU expectations. Some of the Disney plus shows had more impact on the upcoming saga and that is what I think disappoints many."
1255,10,"No spoiler I've must say that I expected more, but this is actually good. First scene of the movie, where is discussed her childhood is such a amazing story. After that its just secondary movie. WE WAITING FOR 2 YEARS AND WHY?P. S I rlly dont want to flop rating bc Im fan of marvel and that is a only one reason why I rate it 10 of 10."
1256,4,"Not worth remembering As with the other reviews, the film could have use da lot of work.Over the top action scenes that did not add to the movie but instead dragged it on to achieve that 2 hour mark. The writing was bland and the acting is paycheck.A few funny scenes, but not enough to save the film. Not worth wasting your money nor time over. It add nothing to the universe and introduces a replacement for Black Widow.I'm glad, however, that Scarlet is free. She can use her potential elsewhere."
1257,2,"Ugh more Marvel trash Enough with these movies. Disney has beaten this dead horse so many times. We get it, y'all make crappy movies that make money off dumb kids. Enough already. Please bring back real cinema. I'm so sick of these comic book crapola. Black Widow is hopefully the final nail in the coffin of these ridiculous offerings."
1258,6,"The Weakest Marvel Film so far. I need to remind myself to rewatch Incredible Hulk and Thor the Dark World, just to see if I am wrong.Is it bad? No. Nothing Marvel has done is ""bad"". However are they formulaic? Yes, they have begun to get formulaic. It also may not surprise you to hear even many good reviews now describe Marvel movies as ""funny"". They seem to move more and more into that comedy realm. Deadpool, Thor Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps the best reviewed and most creator driven of Marvel films.So it's little wonder it gets replicated. Here though, it's getting cringe. It's not that the jokes are bad, in fact Florence Pugh has an incredible talent for comedy. It's just that it's ""everywhere"" - especially at the 45 minute mark.There is very little for Scarlet Johansson to do. In fact, she seems incidental to her entire movie. I'm almost certain you could more or less write Black Widow out of her own movie, replace her with Yelena, and do the exact same plot. Some may say, well it's more about sisterhood, which is fine, but the main character can't be irrelevant to the plot.The movie is also tonally inconsistent. The Red Guardian we meet in prison behaves like a cartoon character. His appearance is even followed up by a cartoonish crash landing in their helicopter, like something out of a Looney Tunes commercial.Do I really want to criticize this movie? Can't I just let it go, call it ""fine""? No. Because Scarlet Johansson should've gotten a Black Widow film ten years ago, and it would've been way better then. They punted, until they killed her off, to just poop out a script that was ""filmable"", and then broom her after all her hard work.There are also many clear pacing issues with the script. The movie doesn't honestly ""get going"" until minute 45, that's when we finally learn ""the mission"". There's a lot of unnecessary set up in the beginning to establish that Black Widow ""has a safe house"". We know she has a safe house. Also! How she got ""the vest from Infinity War"" - because she didn't ""just buy it"" like people do some times. Reminded me a bit of Solo, which means I'll be calling this ""underrated"" in a few years. So there's that.So while I've seen people rate this between a 6 and 7 out of 10, I feel like it ought to have been at least an 8/10. I wouldn't pay $29.99 to see it, which I did, I would either see it in a cheaper theater - that will at least enhance the good special effects - or wait the 45 days."
1259,4,"Non-essential in MCU Black Widow was very highly anticipated until it turns out being a soulless ""spin-off outta MCU for fun"" blockbuster from Marvel. It shows important-less scenes literally in almost every aspect of the show from the partially broken family to the villain(s). Plot is derailed, yet pointless that you will leave the seat whether the end-credit scene is important or not."
1260,7,Such a build us First task master looks horrible in a car PERIOD and black widow almost feels like a side character. Other then that the movies was ok people need to stop hating on it!!!
1261,8,"Another hit from marvel Such a good movie, a must see for all widow and marvel fans alike it has its classic bumps in the road like all, all marvel movies, but it is a good stand alone itself, highly recommend."
1262,2,"I couldn't watch this any longer, I felt my blood pressure increasing. It's just too much violence, and felt my blood pressure getting higher. The story at the beginning was interesting, but it's just not a well written story and way too much violence in place of a more cerebral intelligent thought from what little I did see till I decided to stop watching. This may not be a fair review, but I don't need this adreneline rush. Well written, intelligence, empathy, humor, I find lacking here."
1263,6,"Little sister - better sister Big applause to Scarlett for a wonderful eleven years as Black Widow, if it weren't for her, maybe we wouldn't love this character so much.A must for any MCU fan and the last chance to say goodbye to character."
1264,5,"Disappointingly formulaic MCU movie After being mostly busy during its first two weekends of release, I finally saw ""Black Widow,"" which I was looking forward to because I'm a big fan of the character and wanted to see her get a proper (albeit past-tense) send-off. Scarlett Johansson always does a great job playing her. I love espionage films, and the fact that this seemed to be sort of a homage to gritty spy thrillers like the Jason Bourne franchise also had me interested. The MCU hasn't really done a spy movie before, although the taut political-thriller tone of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has some similarities with this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the final project. The film is serviceable and certainly isn't bad, but it's far too bland and formulaic.The plot of the film centers around Natasha and her sister Yelena (a very strong Florence Pugh,) who were both brainwashed into an assassin program by Russian operatives when they were young--explained early on by an opening scene and a surprisingly quite grim (by MCU standards) opening credits montage. Natasha tries to track down their undercover ""parents"" that brought them into this world, and stop.its mastermind Dreykov and his masked henchman Taskmaster. Johansson and Pugh are always great to watch on screen, and are able to convey grit and realism as well as unique chemistry. David Harbour surprisingly steals the show during his scenes, but Rachel Weisz is sadly underutilized. The film doesn't really differentiate from the typical MCU formula--basically setting up a slightly-connected internal and external conflict culminating in a CGI-filled third-act action climax. What's unfortunate here is that the film misses a lot of opportunities to further develop Natasha as a character in contrast to what we know about her from previous MCU films. While Pugh is good, I'm not sure how much of an integral role she will end up having in the franchise going on.The film's pacing is fast and kinetic, but its story beats and plot tropes feel ""been there, done that"" enough by the standards of the superhero genre for the pacing to feel less significant to viewers than it normally would. Dreykov and Taskmaster are both very weak and underdeveloped villains. Some of the Jason Bourne-esque fight scenes are well choreographed, but the action doesn't really stand out compared to other Marvel films. While it can be mildly entertaining at times, viewers will ask what the broader point was here given the film's relatively light character development, formulaic tendencies, and stakes within the MCU. It's certainly not bad, but it definitely feels like a Phase 1 MCU movie deficient in the intertextuality and distinctness of some of the more recent Marvel adventures--and it doesn't end up doing much to further develop a post-Endgame MCU. Recommended only to die-hard Marvel fans, everyone else can wait to rent or stream it. 5/10."
1265,4,"Pointless exercise. Seems like a pointless exercise to make a film like this. Even more pointless to watch this failed attempt at a movie. There's action but no real story. Conflict, but no emotion, save for the occasional attempt at comedy. Captain America, The First Avenger had everything you'd want...characters you coiuld care for and a story you could understand. In my mind, the series has gone steadily downhill ever since. I'd find it more watchable if there were a limit to the number of characters. I wish they'd stick to basic values and emotions."
1266,3,"Marvel style Movie for 14 y.o. Including dialogues. Waste of time...bottom note: Beautiful women, victims of botox."
1267,2,"Snorefest Com to a Marvel movie for lots of action and some comedy relief in between. Unfortunately, this title delivered on neither. I swear, there was a 45 minute scene where they didn't leave the house. Seriously. They sat at the kitchen table and talked for 45 minutes in a Marvel movie. Sad send off for Scarlett."
1268,6,"Worth a watch,once. Didn't have high hopes at all for this,but got through the over 2 hours no bother,it's a watchable marvel film,there's worse marvel films out than this,special effects are amazing,acting really good,story line average,as say is worth a watch."
1269,1,More boring and confusing that the prequels I had no idea what was happeningHad to leave halfway through.
1270,3,"First movie I've watched in theater since pandemic Given the critical praise this movie received, I was expecting something pretty good. Well, it wasn't. It was bad. I didn't enjoy it at all; it was just a mess of cliche and predictable scenes strung together for 2 hours of filler material.It seemed like a children's movie, so maybe I would rate it higher if it were marketed at the 12-year-old preteens demographic.. but I don't think it was. Yet the writing and acting felt more shallow than most kid's movies. There's a (very one-dimensional cliché) villain and the villain is defeated by the superhero (in the most obvious way possible), then the movie ends. That's literally the whole plot.I'll go ahead and mark this as a spoiler in case the ending wasn't already obvious after watching 15min of the movie. Regret driving an hour through traffic to watch this crap.It had a couple mildly ""funny"" moments and it was visually impressive in some scenes so that's the only thing saving it from a 1-star review."
1271,5,"Ummmm..pretty needless Even being a MCU fan , Black Widow is one of the least interesting characters and hardly had any expectations from the movie so it really didn't dissapoint. It does no changes to the MCU and the events takes place after Civil War so not much of a backstory... The action sequences are top notch and that's probably the only shine in the movie along with some decent performances specially by David Harbour! Would come somewhere in the last row of the MCU favourite lists !!"
1272,9,"REFRESHING AND A MARVEL FAVOURITE Black Widow gave me everything I didn't know I wanted and more. Finally a MCU movie focusing on more serious real-world issues instead of unrelatable fantasy. It felt darker, deeper, and closer to home. Shortland took the MCU and added spice, some artistic flare, a dose of reality, and a powerhouse cast - and quickly turned it into the first and only MCU movie with a character I could relate to and look up to. I've been yearning for film like this since I was a child.PROS: THE NARRATIVE: The MCU has served as a source of decent entertainment for years, but something always seemed to be missing. If you're content with attractive white men with good morals running around killing generic bad men, you've probably enjoyed Marvel's idealist American narrative of the ""perfect, unkillable, attractive white male hero"" until now. But the rest of us have been sick of this for ages. From Jason Bourne to James Bond to Mission Impossible to most MCU movies, the cinematic universe has been wrought with perfect untouchable men parading around while the rest of us roll our eyes buckle in for yet another movie we can't relate to.Black Widow shattered that narrative.I was sitting in the theatre about 20-30 minutes into the movie, trying to figure out what it was missing. Then it hit me - we had gone a half hour without a single portrayal of the perfect all-American man. There was no intelligent, attractive, funny male protagonist who was on his way to get the girl, get the job, save the world, etc. I can't remember the last time I sat through any type of media and there was no idealist male protagonist introduced within 30 minutes. In fact, no perfect male is introduced at all throughout the entire movie - and it left me reeling and surprisingly content.Better yet, we went throughout the entire movie without the women - the stars of the show - being sexualized. Cate also didn't give in to other tiring tropes either - none of the women were focused on romance, none of the women were portrayed as dumb airheads, and perhaps most importantly they weren't utilized for the male gaze or viewership ie. Bond girls.Overall, in terms of gender norms and narratives, Cate Shortland shattered the generic, super hero narrative and rewrote this film to fully and genuinely focus on women as the powerhouses they have the right to be. She gave me an experience in film that I'm not sure I've ever experienced before - Black Widow is well and truly for women, by women, and cleared the stage to make them the true stars of the show. I have been waiting for a real and true female protagonist movie for millennia and didn't expect to find it in Black Widow, but here we are.THE CAST:I thought that Natasha's ""family"" was wonderfully cast and added a lot of depth and reality to the film. Florence Pugh was wonderful (as always) and her chemistry with Scarlett was notable. Harbour and Weis were hilarious together, and their comedy carried the film in many ways.ARTISTIC CHOICES:I was surprised and delighted by the deeper, darker, more chilling atmosphere of the film, and thought that the introduction - the first 30-45 minutes - were directed masterfully. I loved the cinematography, and the editing in the intro seemed more purposeful than most MCU movies. Hair, makeup, and costume were very exciting as well - I can imagine young women already planning out their Halloween outfits and adding more braids to their hair styling routine. The composer - a favourite of mine, Lorne Balfe, did a great job as well at creating a chilling atmosphere.Cons:the action sequences were unbelievable, in typical MCU fashion. Physics and gravity have left the chatPugh and Johansson rarely acted as if their injuries were serious enoughPugh seemed a little stiff in the scene where she made fun of natasha's fighting stance - she struggled to get down and up, and whether for comedic effect or not it did not seem characteristic of a top tier killerVery VERY typical American depiction of the soviets as bad. When will THIS narrative in Hollywood end????the villains were built up to be amazing and strong, and yet were taken care of - fairly indirectly - in a quick manner. Explosions and falls were the real reasons the villains perished and/or stopped fighting (ie widows). They didn't put up much of a fight, either.unbelievable hair, makeup, and outfit transitions (did Pugh's captors literally undo her braids before the intended surgery??)Overall, this movie was refreshing and had great acting, chemistry, comedy, and for the MCU - artistic flair. I found it more relatable and realistic than an MCU movie before. I want to thank Cate Shortland for keeping this film true to women.Any negative reviews are either from die-hard MCU fans or people who cant handle strong emotions, people caring for others, sensitive topics regarding women's rights, or strong female characters."
1273,7,"It's not as bad as you think! You might be perplexed to see such a low rating and alot of negative reviews, well I was also confused. But, it's not as bad as they say, it was decent with some heartfelt moments. Yes, the plot could have been much better, for a last send-off to Natasha, screenplay could have been a bit tighter. But at the end, you won't regret watching it, it's not as bad as Captain marbel and not as good as Winter Soldier. Yelena(Pugh!) was the complete show stealer! Whatta natural charisma! Expecting to see a spin-off for her character."
1274,5,"Goodbye and Good Riddance to a bad part of the MCU As a long time comic reader, I am a fan of the Black Widow. The comic version. She is a character that has deep roots in the comic universe and they were wasted in the Avengers movies and when she had a chance to become something bigger they had the wrong actress. So when you have this actress in a vehicle that is supposed to be her origin/swam song you expect a huge kick ass movie. FAIL!!!!! Scarlett Johansson is wooden and just not what you expect as her final movie to be present in the role. She is carried by her cute/funny as hell co-star Florence Pugh. This girl carried the movie and when she shows up down the road in the MCU will be well received and will be a force to be reckoned with.Overall, I went because I wanted it to be good. I will be forced to buy it because I am a slave to the Disney/Marvel machine. I will not enjoy it though."
1275,5,"A bunch of fighting and little to no story The movie keeps going from fight to fight. It gives you no break, and sometimes it doesn't make sense why they are fighting, for example the fight with her sister. The cgi slowly got worse through out the movie, and so did the plot. The only thing that saved this was the opening scene between Black Widow and her family, even that scene couldn't go 2 seconds without a bunch of punching though."
1276,8,"Maybe there's a sequel The mix of conspiracy, family drama and fighting is pretty good. A very effective opening to find out the background of Black Widow and become one of the best in the MCU. Had missed the relationship between Natasha and Yelena at the beginning of their battle, but surely the adult Yelena character was easily recognizable. The encounter of Captain America's characters (Natasha's father and Yelena) in the Russian version is enough to provide a comedy spice. For the villain, it's a bit disappointing, too ordinary. Hoping it would have something to do with Avenger Infinity war, it really doesn't. Maybe there's a sequel, right?"
1277,6,"Some entertainment but largely forgettable I really don't think I'll remember the plot in 1 year.Painful memory, a new villain who wants to take over the world, same satirical humor altho none are really that funny.Has some okay action but I really don't like all the camera shaking. It's sad because due to the pandemic, they had plenty of time to refine the movie yet it's still mediocre."
1278,5,"And they say MCU doesn't make bad movies This movie is just all over the place.Well, first of all the movie didn't feel like Black Widow, more like a Family of Widow's. When watching a movie you can sometimes tell how it's going to play out, the MCU trope is definitely the one you can see in a mile away, but it works when they have a good story and Black Widow doesn't have one. Especially when the characters they give you, you don't care about. There's so many flaws in the movie, and it's surprising that they still greenlit this one. It's more of a fan service but other than that the film is whatever. The villain is surprisingly bad and the way they tried to make the character connect within the story is just lazy writing. There goes a villain, Taskmaster, that I was anticipating to see just turn to a lame sheet paper written character right next to other villains that MCU didn't do justice.Throughout the film you get a bit of both, which some might call it story and action, but it's layered with bad pacing and editing to which you don't care much of what is happening. There's a point in the movie that the filmmakers try to give you a glimpse of the ""family reunion"" by doing a catch up, and making you understand more so of WHO these characters are. Trying to give you emotional feeling but it sure does go on for a little too long which makes the scene overwhelming.Finally, some of the action sequences are too wonky, which is mainly the editing that makes it feel out of place. Although, there's a specific scene that I enjoyed was when Black Widow and Taskmaster first fought, which is surprisingly baffling that they gave you these other action sequences that are too crappy.The ""best"" part is the after credits, which showcase what's going to happen in the following MCU story giving it a full circle. Other than that the movie falls flat becoming abysmal."
1279,10,"The best film of the moment An amazing movie with a crazy story, special breathtaking effects, a grand tape and a Johansson Scarlett at the top of the top."
1280,6,"I was hoping for more... An enjoyable watch for the most part. All the actors did a fine job. The ""big baddie"" is Dreykov - but he doesn't get enough screen time to become the villain he's supposed to be. Pretty hammy with all the ""pheromones"" and all.I think this could have been so much more with a better, more experienced, set of writers. It almost at times felt that Black Widow as not the focus of her own movie. Scarlett is fantastic as always and I enjoyed the addition of Florence Pugh as Yelena. David Harbour is enjoyable as ""Red Guardian"", but I don't care that I now know what that character is or was supposed to be.The comedy felt forced at times with Yelena getting the most laughs from me.The CGI, etc. Are off the charts as in all the Marvel movies.Marvel needs to move on and come up with some new stuff... this was, yet again, hero has conflict with someone they are emotional about, they have to fight, they make up, the bad guy is floating around somewhere in plain site, they have a big fight at the end and the good guys win. We've seen enough of this.I think the Black Widow character (and Scarlett) deserved more and I'm sad that #1, this movie wasn't made and run right after 'Civil War' and #2, that this movie didn't provide a sufficient emotional punch for one of Marvel's best and well developed characters. It's sad. The idea behind this movie was good I think; it was just executed poorly.It will make a good sum of money because Scarlett is that popular, but I left the theater a little disappointed."
1281,10,Let there be freedom for all the exploited Introducing the family of incredibles. A brilliant Marvel of a movie signifying the freedom of self.
1282,4,"Classic Marvel movie Honestly what did you expect? Movie was terrible, I was barely able to watch it. Over the top action, too much CGI, unnecessary dialogue and a terrible story writing. That is what this movie has to offer."
1283,5,Below average Probably the weakest film of marvel till date in my opinion.Most the scenes didn't make any sense and the cgi was terrible.This movie is not like the other marvel movies.
1284,7,"An average affair Firstly, we needed more Budapest ... Secondly, the Taskmaster was wasted ... Thirdly, the villan was not really menacing...But, honestly was expecting to see more of the Black Widow before she came to the Avengers... This was only covered as an afterthought in a few conversations, really...Definitely a movie that missed it's potential.Sad, as this could very well be the last we see of her, until a reboot perhaps...Sigh."
1285,3,"ScarJo deserves better Boring movie, the villain Taskmaster didn't had any impact on the story. The story was very simple and predictive all the time. Nothing is great about this movie."
1286,9,I want to see this movie on filmstaden with him alexander I want to ser this movie with him Alexander on filmstaden.
1287,6,"Not so good, but definitely not so bad. This movie was nothing what we thought it would be. It was expected to be a tribute to Natasha, but instead this movie was just used to create a base for some of the upcoming MCU movies. There was a lack of proper villain, we did not expect such a weak villain in a MCU movie. There was a lack of action scenes in the movie. The character of Taskmaster, which we all loved in negative role, was destroyed in this movie.But some of the scenes such as the chasing scene, the jail escaping scene and the post credit scene were amazing. The post credit scene established a base for the upcoming MCU movies and also introduced us to a new and permanent MCU character - Yelena Belova.6/10 considering the huge budget, amazing visuals, perfect acting, post credit scene, a few twists and finally, Yelena."
1288,1,"No power, no reality, no abilities boundary. People who are aware of previous marvel movies about black widow abilities going to find this movie utter nonsense.For example, 1st scene that turned me off -Red guardian first lifting the bulk to clear out way for aeroplane showed his strength (cheesy way), but in next scene when he lifts his wife, it feels that he finds her heavy as normal fellow.And other characters also can do anything story demands even if that is not in their expertise or abilities."
1289,1,"Worst Marvel Movie yet Absolutely stupid, who wrote this? Scarlet was the executive producer. Apparently she had nothing better to do."
1290,7,"Decent, but not great Let's get one thing straight. I'm drunk and want to curse far more in this review than IMDB will allow.The characterization here is the most enjoyable part - the actors really explode with personality, development, and the familial element is so raw and real. It was insanely easy to believe that they were a dysfunctional family that loved each other. Their stories are so interesting. For a quick, fleeting moment, you can even catch a glimpse of Rachel Weisz playing Evie (The Mummy) again. Blink and you'll miss her delivery, but it's there. David Harbour is bombastic and lovable. Florence Pugh is has a humor and mystique to her, even after the movie ends, and I cannot wait to see her develop further.BUT. The CGI and action sequences are so dumb it will transport you back to 1994 when the fire and explosions looked like ps1 graphics. I am still in disbelief that this movie was made in 2021... they need to drop the studio who did this movie. Forever. It was distracting me from what was on screen.And to add to that, the characters were making it through absolutely unlivable situations. Huge explosions right next to Black Widow or Florence Pugh and they just do a backflip, or run through the fire. It was like those old garbage Delta Force movies. Then the giant space station in the sky? Exists? Why? No one has ever noticed this giant town-sized object in their airspace? Just preposterous.I am actually livid that this part of the movie exists. So much of the movie is good, and then the last act is an inexplicable shift to mediocrity.Overall, the movie is good. I will watch it again on my AMC Stubs."
1291,8,"One of the best Marvel movies in years. Throughout the pacing and acting were top shelf. Each of the main cast pulled their own weight and contributed to a fantastic caper.One of the best aspects of this film was that all the while you watch these characters with rich, pained backstories travel through a story line about good and evil perceptions and an evil organization, unraveling the plot that connects it all. Not once is it forced down the viewers throat that this is a ""girl power"" movie. This only further stresses what a hot pile of garbage Capt Marvel was.One of the worst aspects of this movie was that as the story escalated, they were obligated to further and further up the ante of typical Marvel action sequences. The movie was strong and easily stood on its own without the 20 minutes of explosions and fighting that took place near the end.Overall, fantastic. It should have probably come out in 2016."
1292,8,Weird family connection A average marvel movie.look forward a dark version of black widow.this movie not much explaination why S. J spend so much effort fighting Hawkeye to sacrifice in end game. Hope to see her conection with Hawkeye and Nick flury in next movie if have.still worth to watch in big theater for entertainment.
1293,8,"Honest Review Ok, not sure what these idiots are watching but the movie was great. Look, these Yahoo's doing reviews for living are MORONS. It's a an action syfy movie based on fantasy and comic books LOL.As for the villain, well for once it was a more realistic one than a giant who can change universe with CLICK of fingers. Lol.Look, it's great fun, action start to finish and she shared the screen well with her costars.Have fun with it. You don't go to a DC comic based syfy flick looking for academy awards LOL. Just click right past these moron review PPL trying to make money with it.Great movie when there few N far betwern.Now for the RIDICULOUS biggest pirated movie story. Hey. It's 2021. Stop taking advantage of PPL n forcing them into theaters. Charge a fair price for a download or stream, you ACTUALLY make more money N won't have to worry about pirates. But as it cost a C note to go to movies N have hotdogs, popcorn N drink, for one lol, you not going to get much sympathy from real folks. PERIOD."
1294,4,"Not a black widow movie First thing you have to understand is this is not a black widow movie. It's a movie intended to introduce her sister as a character to the MCU. And that's the most dissapointing part because it means no plot, no effort in the movie just a regular cashgrab as it's often the case with marvels projects nowadays. Black widow as a character has no depth in this movie other than making stupid jokes.And the villain is just as bad. Taskmaster is one of the most compelling characters in the villain territory and in this movie it feels like he's irrelevant. We're talking about a movie that doesn't care to develop any of it's characters in what it's black widows farewell to the mcu..."
1295,10,"Awesome Natasha is simply fearless and amazing. Over the years I keep wondering when Marvel was going to give her, her own story as she is 1 of the 2 humans who runs with the superheroes and she did not disappoint. Loved it."
1296,1,ignoring the controversy I know what they said so I will move on and quit watching DISNEY because if they can hire them after the gross and incriminating words and actions is disgusting communist guy was good though:]
1297,5,"Decent for a marvel movie If you can ignore the excessive amount of cgi, poor child acting, poor Russian accents and excessive amount of plot holes (especially the ridiculous after credit scene) then Black widow isn't too bad of a film, in fact I found it more enjoyable than most marvel films.Despite Florence Pugh's shocking Russian accent she was a massive highlight in the film and without a doubt the strongest performing actor. The after credit scene is a definite confirmation that she'll be joining the marvel universe which I believe it will massively benefit the franchise although without giving away any spoilers, her reasoning for being added is incredibly poor.I do believe that this film would have been way better if it was released before end game and would have made black widow's death far more tragic considering we would have known more about her background.As someone who doesn't enjoy marvel films, I do find it incredibly frustrating how these films aren't being released in more of a linear order so that people that don't want to waste their time watching every single garbage movie they push out in order to understand what the hell is going on, can follow the plot.Also I do believe that western cinema in general suffers from not hiring actors who's natural accents match the characters they play. It's incredibly painful to sit through a 2 hour movie and hear an American try and portray a Russian, the accents come across incredibly stereotypical. Marvel films shouldn't need to bring in recognisable faces anymore considering the size of their audience. Instead they should use their massive fanbase to bring in lesser known actors from different nationalities, therefore boosting the careers of lesser known actors and giving the characters a more authentic feel.My rating does feel fairly harsh considering I did somewhat enjoy the film however there are far too many irritating details with the film that annoyed me and my slightly biased hatred towards movies from the marvel franchise and how badly it's affected the movie industry simply won't allow me to rate it any higher. For those that watch films for fun or to unwind then I would recommend this film, however for those that still see the film industry as an art I'd advise to stay away."
1298,7,"Go with the Flo This was a solo film long overdue for Black Widow and it doesn't disappoint. That said, it doesn't overwhelm either.The plot is easy to follow and the surprise reveal isn't that surprising. If anything, the biggest surprise is that *SPOILER ALERT* Steve Rogers doesn't appear, not even in voice form.Scarlet Johansson is a pleasure to watch and Florence Pugh looks to match her in the action stakes. Rachel Weisz is always good to watch (easy in the eye too) and David Harbour adds both humour and hubris.I definitely hope to see more of Florence Pugh moving forward."
1299,1,"(Spoilers) Worst marvel movie ever Where do i need to start. The beginning was quite okay with the setup of her being black widow. But see breaks her back every time but survives. I believe more in every other marvel character then Blackwidow that says a lot. Her car was exploded, she fell off a tower were black widow (Natasha) survived and one other black widow doesnt survive or badly injured. Then the disappointment of Taskmasker comes along what makes it even worse. By being a daughter of the end boss (what a shock that the daughter a bomb attack survived what a wonder with a bit of a scar) And then the ending everyone survived and they all live and nothing happends. Maybe I didn't liked the movie because I can't stand the actors of it. And disliked the movie before it was made (when announced)."
1300,1,"Pointless First off I am a huge Marvel fan, or was before this movie. The whole time while watching I kept thinking what is the point? Why do I care? Natasha is dead so why is this movie trying to make us care about her character? The movie was poorly written and the plot was underdeveloped. There was no screen time for the villain and the characters just seemed stupid most the time. The only redeeming qualities were Yelena and Red Guardian. Black Widow seemed like a side character in her own movie. Marvel is going downhill, that was made particularly clear after the end credit scene which was horrible. The whole movie was pointless and just another ploy for Disney and Marvel to make money. I am disappointed in the studio."
1301,6,"Cool CGI I love the speed chase scene, avalanche scene and sky fortress scene CGI. And task master copy the pose of avengers. This is the climax of the movie, but other scene is very boring."
1302,5,"They destroyed this movie The First half was good; the second half just fell apart. The story was fragile. The Black Widow was sidelined in her own movie. The villain never existed. The CGI work was very bad.The gender swap of the TaskMaster told me that Black Widow couldn't win against a man. This is highly offensive.Black Widow is a character who would sacrifice herself to save humanity; this was not captured in this movie.Excluding all the other avenger characters from this movie was a mistake. It belittles the Black Widow. It is like she can't shine unless all other ""heros"" are not available.The ""mushy mushy"" feeling from the saved Widows is over the top. Those are strong women, who happen to be trained killers. They won't go soft and play with dolls just because some miracle gas freed them. They should have killed every last soldier in that fortress."
1303,6,"Not Great, Not Terrible It felt like a filler episode in a generic TV Series. Even though I enjoyed the action and the portrayal of Yelena by Florence Pugh, which was amazing in my opinion; the overall story of Black Widow didn't shine too brightly. Stretched too long and forgetting about one of the most important heroes of the Wave-1 Avenger era - Natasha Romanov; the aftertaste of the movie is too bland for my taste."
1304,6,Ok movie Not the worst MCU movie. This is more about Yelena than about Black Widow but who really cares? And Florence Pugh's acting is good. Scarlett Johansson has some good scenes. Some good action scenes as well. Some boring over-the-top scenes as usual with Marvel. The story isn't really interesting (the start was promising but then it fell back to a standard Marvel product).Yet it still makes an ok entertainment even though much too long like most Marvel movies.
1305,2,"Nonsense I really wanted to like this movie - Florence is a fantastic actress and I've always loved Scarlett in this role - but no amount of fine acting could save this one for me. The plot is so convoluted and disjointed as to be almost nonsensical, and there are so many plot holes and retcons with respect to the rest of the MCU. This movie is too little, too late. I'd give it a skip or at least wait for non-premium viewing."
1306,8,Don' t understand bad reviews It was entertaining movie with nice plot and good acting. Better than some other marvel movies. It came late... So what? I enjoyed it and had fun.
1307,7,"Had great potential The opening credit sequence in this movie is one of the best I've ever seen as far as I can remember. I am a big fan of 007 movie opening credit sequences, they get me excited. However, for this movie the opening credit sequence hits you like a train, from the first second it starts till the end, the haunting images and an absolute breathtaking rendition of smells like teen spirit just keeps pulling you in, until it smacks you right across the face and makes you question the world we live in.At that point you'd think, Marvel is not playing around, this is going to be something new, something dark but alas, just another Marvel movie with jokes in serious situation and physics defying action sequences.They did not utilize the villain properly for this film. What could've been a dark, impactful movie that would've been talked about for years, became just another semi-superhero action movie.Its a good watch though, watched it with friends and we enjoyed it, but it just leaves you wanting more. You'll wish the movie was something very different (or you may not, that's just how I felt)."
1308,9,"FINALLY Black Widow gets the spotlight she deserves As the only original female avenger, Natasha will always hold a special place in my heart. 'I was so giddy while watching this film. When Black Widow made her corny superhero entrance at the Russian prison, a tear fell from my eye because I was just so happy she was finally getting her moment.Despite the poorly installed wig in the first couple of scenes, all the production aspects were amazing. The transformation of the Red Guardian was hilarious. Such a twist to how the comics portray him.I am in love with Yelena. Florence Pugh could not have glided into the Marvel Cinematic Universe any smoother. Her light-hearted and comedic personality was the perfect fit for the tone of the film. It wasn't cheesy comedy which I loved, sometimes Marvel can be a bit too cheesy for me. Her best moment is when she lands in the superhero pose, after making fun of Natasha for it, and gets completely disgusted with herself.Personally, I would have liked to see a bit more of Natasha's back story; how she escaped the Red Room or how Nick Fury recruited her.I am so happy to see Natasha have this film for herself.When Yelena visited her grave at the end of the film, and did their whistle call, I thought for sure that we would hear the reply of the whistle and Natasha would still be alive. A girl can dream."
1309,8,"Better than expected When you want to give grade to a comic book movie you should do it in its own context, so I believe the story line acting and the entire movie was one of the best of comic book movie and one of the best in Marvel...it was much better than I expected ..."
1310,8,This movie give some closure to black widow story.. sort of I have watch the trailer couple of times & see the movie after that. It didn't disappoint me one bit. I know there should be more to it in this movie than it been has shown but I believe it will be bonus later in bluray or special edition.The one abt Natasha been trained to be a Super spy agent was not shown .. unfortunately.. but if their make it a series.. who knows that the storyline will be cover including Budapest thingy with Clint Barton.I also saw the box office result 2 weeks after it was shown in cinema & other platform ... I don't care what some of the critic say abt this movie.. stated that it wasn't satisfactory & also the taskmaster identity has been question & ridicule.Some of the story is quite obvious & easy to read especially the scene where all of them been capture.Overall the movie I give it a 8. 7 too low while 9 is abit too much .
1311,9,Empowering I loved the two strong female leads. It gave good and an interesting back story with some plot twists x.
1312,1,"Bad on so many levels !! Apart from acting of the protagonists (which also sometimes looked forced) everything else is bad. Worst direction, poor script, CGI was ok, bad music, you name it."
1313,4,boring movie Expected more from this movie. Natasha deserved better.
1314,10,"Underrated, highly entertaining and sad but true story linked to Society. Only thing I can say is I wish it were longer and we had one more fight scene with Black Widow and Taskmaster. The opening scene and artist credits with a great song choice starts the movie up perfectly. Black Widow sister instantly becomes a fan favorite and I wish they would bring Black Widow back because she deserves a trilogy. Action scenes were on next level and the drama and sad truth of the movie is it's backbone. ""How did you keep your heart?"" For the most part this movie stayed on Task."
1315,7,My review The plot was simple and didn't have any big surprises i personally liked the beginning the most.
1316,8,"It was a good movie, don't know what the hate is about I'm gonna give this movie a solid 8 coz you start enjoying it from the very start if you are paying the attention. If you can like the captain America first movie , i don't understand why you don't like black widow, she doesn't have any super powers we all know that she is a spy and that's what we see in the movie, Movie has some cool action you can enjoy this movie with family, ignore all the hate reviews you see you should definitely watch it for once and decide for yourself."
1317,3,It's absurd to release this movie now I feel this movie still batter than Captain marvel and wonder woman 84.
1318,7,"Better than I expected but standard formula film I give it a 7 as it was entertaining, but there are lots of issues like why they decided to employ someone to make a big stomp noise every time Taskmaster walked into the scene, got tedious especially when we all knew this character weights about 9 stone. I was lost in the action so that got me through it."
1319,7,Casting didn't do it for me. I like the storyline but just couldn't accept the casts as Russians. Just threw me off especially with the cheesy accents. Scarlet can pull it off but the others nope.
1320,10,Totally Badass This movie is amazing and mind blowing with nonstop action I definitely recommend seeing Black Widow it's worth watching I give the movie all 10 stars it's one of the best marvel movies ever made.
1321,6,Just above average The movie had good story. But choice of music scote was not good at all. The dialogs were ok and they did not utilize the red room story ark or many characters story ark properly. If they did all that movie could have been a blockbuster. This movie somehow felt should have released after black panther as well.
1322,4,watch an old movie instead. The story is the lamest of all marvel movies. Nothing makes sense. Waste of time. I even forgot most of the movies after just 1 day.
1323,8,"i love this movie Idk why there's so many bad reviews, this is one of my fav mcu movies. It was great and i loved it. Scarlett, florence, rachel, and david were amazing actors. And i was so excited when i found out natasha was getting her own movie after so many years. I love how we got introduced to so many new characters and hope to see them again!! I really love melina i'm sorry :)) also i feel like natasha has one of the coolest backstories in the og six and that opening credit scene was the best one in the mcu."
1324,7,Black Widow!!! Nice Movie. But didn't reach my expectations. You must watch if you are a Marvel fan.
1325,9,"Phenomenal. Complex, Dark and Captivating. Actual acting and great action. Manages to say something real without virtue signaling. This movie was fantastic. Great writing, very good action sequences while taking the time to tell a story and allow the characters time to breathe. Darkly funny in places. Really good performances. It's well made and well directed. Has actual emotional and social depth without being self congratulatory."
1326,2,"super hero trash Stupid bad guys, bad guy guns firing blanks or nerf dart, laws of physics worse than a really bad SF movie and plot holes you could drive an aircraft carrier through and just plain boring..."
1327,1,"Disney trying to make a Dark carácter in Princess Very boring, to slow and then the action scene to fast, disappointed."
1328,8,Doesn't deserve the bad reviews Is it great? No. But certainly not worth a 3. The biggest issue with the movie is that they tried to make it a more serious marvel film but still have a little comedic relief which made them kinda fail at both and made the serious parts feel kinda dragged out. Action was decent. There were a lot of conveniences but it's a marvel movie so what do you expect. I was entertained for 2 hours.
1329,6,Good movie full of stamps The essence of the film is Hannah + Bourne + mind control + cliches about Russians. Thanks to Marvel though it doesn't suck like Black Panther. It will go once. And it will go to understand that neither the Widow nor the Falcon nor the Hawk are able to compete with normal avengers.
1330,9,"It's a good closure for Natasha Romanoff It was sad to see Natasha killed off in the Avengers Endgame, but I think this film is a good closure for her character in the MCU even though it's not the most brilliant one amongst it. I was hoping to see more of her history, like how she became a Black Widow, how she was trained, how they tried to break her, what sort of hardships she went through in the red room and then later went on to defect to S. H. I. E. L. D. etc. But this was more of filling the gap in between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. Story-wise, I'm not really very satisfied.However, it's definitely a brilliant choice to cast Ever Anderson as the younger Natasha. Not only is she a great child actress, she even has some resemblance of Scarlett Johansson especially the shape of her mouth. Even before her character's name was mentioned in the film, one look at her, I knew she was playing Natasha Romanoff.All good things have to end, so here's goodbye to Natasha Romanoff and hello to MCU 4. Iron Man will be missed too."
1331,6,"Charasmatic Actors Find a Way Through a Muddy Story The plot escaped me and only came into focus halfway through the picture. Could not understand why the two sisters had to duel to a death grip in sheets, or was it curtains, when they meet after many years apart. Nevertheless, Johansson and Pugh click with each other in a back and forth that's fun to watch. But when I smiled the most was when I was watching David Harbor taking not a bit of this seriously."
1332,8,"Somewhat fun! Caught this one at the theatre, and thought Scarlett, portraying a Russian named Natasha, whom is a heroic, was fairly great!"
1333,6,"A reminder that sometimes too late is not a good idea There are three movies released in 2018 (the year in which this movie should have been made) that tell the same story with a deeper characterization and longer and better actions sequences: Red Sparrow, Anna and Mission Impossible: Fallout.After a long but engaging prologue this movie goes downhill with boring action, forced jokes, poor character development and cliched story. But as my movie theater had a great sound at least I had a great technical cinematic experience. And Scarlet, Florence and Rachel are gorgeous and try their best, so that made the movie tolerable. Still, if someone hasn't seen Captain America: Civil War, or doesn't know what the future of the MCU looks like with the TV series, the references to the Avengers and the post credits scene won't make sense, so the movie doesn't stand on its own."
1334,8,"Not that bad! I've been very bored with Marvel movies over the last 5 or so years because they all have felt the same.This felt like something different and was actually interesting. Obviously there should've been a Black Widow movie years ago, but I'm glad we finally got one and that I didn't hate it."
1335,5,"Did Black Widow or Yelena take super soldier serum? If not this movie makes no senseAnd the dumbing down of the plot to explain scenes/twists is ridiculousWasted Taskmasker, an incredible villainSo, so disappointed just like all the 3 Disney+ moviesIs this the future of Marvel?"
1336,9,"Better than many Marvel movies It exceeded my expectations. Great acting, pleasant mix of emotions, excellent cgi."
1337,6,"I GIVE A 6 for a MARVEL STANDARD This movie is pretty entertaining but after hits by hits by awesomeness MARVEL UNIVERSE MOVIES end with amazing ENDGAME.... This is a solid 6 (i could give worst but the fact that the movie is pretty entertaining save this) There could be so much potential. BUT THEY KEEP WRITTEN HER AS SIDE KICK even in her own movies, nothing special. They could've dig deeper on her personal past, since it was talked a little in AGE OF ULTRON. But i just feels like the story is RUSHED and forces to fit to the MCU... Just doesn't up to the standards after END GAME.."
1338,4,"be honest, this has a 7 because of scarlet johanson's ass You are all in love with her, the movie is boring and over the top typicall hollywood...."
1339,1,Waste of time Puked in my mouth a little bit. If I wanted to watch family therapy I would watch Dr Phil.How this movie got such a high rating.
1340,5,"As expected, a big pile of meh. I am a hardcore MCU fan, growing up reading Marvel comics back in the 90s. Fresh from my MCU marathon ending with Endgame, I was skeptical of shows like WandaVision or Falcon & Winter Soldier, which had premises that didn't sound interesting to me but I ended up really liking. Black Widow was a movie I also had little interest in, but from my recent experiences I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and hope it would get some of that MCU magic.Alas, there is very little about that movie I liked. First and foremost, the fake Russian accents coming and going for no reason really irked me. It really didn't help what I thought were subpar acting performances from actors I know can deliver a ton more than they do here (Johansson, Harbour, Weisz, etc.). The directing was all over the place, action scenes were a hot mess, and some of the special effects were a disgrace for something with the MCU stamp on it. The story and writing have so many plot holes and things that don't make sense I'm not going to even try and count them.Very disappointing overall, and by far the weakest MCU movie to date. Just skip that one."
1341,6,"James Bondish and too woke for my taste Why is BW 2021 woke? First of all there aren't any good men to see here. Guys are either stupid, antagonistic or outright evil.On the other side there is the ""Sisterhood"" feeling which the movie even explicitly mentions. There were two men and around a twentysome women in the theatre. My young friend dragged me into it and I wanted her to be happy.So, there I sat and I wondered who would make such an imbalanced type of movie? Having a strange idea of genders is one thing, but it was also about character development and character interaction.Johanssons performance and storyline was fine, but that of her family far less so. There was no chemistry between the members at time although the story has a few explanations. I loved to see Rachel Weisz again, but I felt she lacked screentime. Florence Pugh is different generation and the youngest of the three. And I felt reminiscences of the usual teenage flick out there. Something I try to avoid in my spare time. It's not bad acting but I can't stand the mix of sassiness, sarcasm and negativity.The whole movie was written in James Bond style. It had it all and there was no need for having superheroes in it, with just a few adjustments to the script. It was a Bond script in disguise of a Marvel superhero movie. Let's just add that there are a only a few cross references to other Marvel content. Bond movies have the disadvantage that they are both stereotypical and predictable. Likewise we get to see expensive sets and locations. The chase gets a bit old though after a while.When it comes to style and editing, this is state of the art. It's all beautiful and well colored. But just as already stated: there are about one or two sets more than it's good.To sum it up, it was at once entertaining but it also drained my nerves to watch anything like this in the future.One last thing: in times of Covid, we're forced to wear masks. This contradicts movies in 3D. Yet, it can be hard to see anything with foggy glasses. The effects weren't bad but they were not needed either.This one is for the girls."
1342,2,"Its Your Average Superhero Movie ( This is my first movie review on this app so take this review with a grain of sand. With my reviews I don't like going into what the movie was when it came to editing and cinematography but I will touch on that ).In order for you to understand my thoughts going into the movie I'm going to explain exactly what my expectations where. I am a massive movie and superhero nerd. If you were to ask any of my friends that watch movies they would tell you that one of my top 10 favourite Marvel movies is Captain America ""The Winter Solider"". While I was searching and looking around youtube and the internet as most people do, I found a certain amount of videos and articles online that had stated that this movie was going to be like Captain America The Winter Solider. After hearing this my expectations for this movie were very positive and I was ecstatic to watch this movie. My sister and I, who also loves to watch Marvel movies decided to give the movie a shot and buy it. I was going into this movie thinking I was going to come out happy and have had a good time.After the post credit scene which I will get back to, I felt one word, empty. I felt that this movie didn't serve a purpose and that it felt like a lazy attempt to set up an evil avengers storyline. I felt that the movie was your basic Marvel movie, funny scenes, action, suspenseful moments, a good story and great character building. I will break down each of these in paragraphs to explain how I feel about the movie.When it came to comedy it was your basic comedy, you either laugh at the jokes or know that there was a joke trying to be told but you just blocked it out. I believe there was only one funny scene I laughed out loud at which was when the helicopter crashed ( if you watched the movie you would know ). Overall the comedy was average.When it came to the action, yikes, what to say about the action. This might be some of the most boring and worst action I have ever scene in a Marvel movie. I feel that movies need to have a purpose for action scenes or at least if a movie has a purpose to the actions scenes then it is better. The action scenes felt like they would just happen because the film would just be boring. After every Marvel movie that I've seen I've always wished that I had helped create those exact scenes. After this movie I felt like even an average Marvel fan would be able to create a better and more creative fight scene. The only fight scene that I would say was somewhat interesting was when Black Widow fought Taskmaster on the flying building as it fell to the ground. Even that scene ended bad as the scene ended with black widow and taskmaster just fighting on the ground for around 30 seconds. Overall the action was terrible.When it came to suspense I felt nothing. It sucks because you already know how this movie is going to go, none of black widows family is going to die, the main villain will be defeated or die ( not talking about taskmaster ). The suspense wasn't as good of a movie, comparing it to Captain America. Overall didn't feel any suspense in the film.When it came to the story it was just a basic go there go here, get this and end of movie. Black Widow sadly felt useless in this movie which is funny since its called Black Widow. I felt that the plot was moving and the side characters just moved and pulled Black Widow with them. When it came to the post credit scene I was some what excited as it gets me a hyped for the Hawkeye show. Overall the story was basic.When it came to character building I honestly believe that if this movie came out before endgame ( which it originally was supposed to ) I would have felt the same same way about Black Widow. This didn't make me like or hate black widow more it just made me say "" hey there's Black Widow, she dies in endgame "". This is no disrespect to the character of Black Widow as I feel she is the best and my favourite female marvel hero and Scarlett Johnson has put her heart into this role but at the end of it this doesn't improve on her character. The only good and best character from this film that I loved and everyone else seems to love is Florence Pughs character, she is so great in this movie. She was the only one in the film that actually was and seems like will be an important character. The other side characters are fine at best they serve their purpose to the story and I don't care whether or not they show up again. I do have to say though that David Harbours character was a very entertaining character as his scenes were the only one that either made me laugh or made me want to. The villain of the movie, Dreykov, is the worst and most basic superhero villain of all time. Take a guess what his goal is, did you say it was to take over the world well..., OF COURSE ITS TAKE OVER THE WORLD WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE, YOU THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE AN INTERESTING AND HEARTBREAKING MOTIVATION, NO. THIS LOSER OF A VILLAIN JUST FELT LONELY AND DECODED HE WANTED TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, WHEN HE DIED I LAUGHED OUT LOUD AND IT WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY IT WAS JUST SO DUMB THAT I NEEDED TO LAUGH. When it came to the actual villain everyone wanted to see, Taskmaster, it was disappointing. I don't wanna get in a massive rant like people are about Taskmaster but I just felt that she wasn't threatening and she was just there to make the movie have more action scenes. Overall the character building is mediocre.Overall this movie felt disappointing even though my expectations weren't the best, I feel that if this movie was cancelled I wouldn't even care. Is it worth the 40 dollars I payed no. If you are going into this movie just wanting to watch and have a silly good time then yes its worth it but for a marvel movie it goes beside Captain Marvel as an average super hero movie ( and I haven't even finished Captain Marvel ).My score for this movie is a solid 5 out of 10."
1343,5,"So close but so far away. Some of the effects in the 3rd act are so over the top, inserting tech or a surprise hero helper would have made it better. Got a little too crazy at the end.Also-Taskmaster just may be the biggest botched villain of the entire MCU. Great villain turned into complete trash for this movie. This goes into the pile of MCU movies that I've seen but will probably never watch again. Scarlet and her character is awesome, it's the filmmakers that did her and her film dirty."
1344,3,"The rock bortom. While watching this movie and still haven't reached the end of it, I'm calling 3,5 out of 10.The green screen and special effects are taken wide and lose and makes it all look cheap and rushed through. I'm getting a feeling of Michael bay, ""put in as much explosions as we can in every fram"" kind of wibe. That the cuteness they put in everywhere, no-one of the good guys can die here and we must save everyone.. seriously this was a waste of time and electricity!"
1345,4,"Wasted potential Somber conversations with characters showing emotions and vulnerability are mashed together with action sequences of invincible heroes on a CGI battlefield, where a characters trauma gets turned into the next marvel-patent joke.Feels like two movies spliced together."
1346,8,"A Winning Return of the MCU The Marvel Cinematic Universe is back!With the much delayed premiere of BLACK WIDOW, the MCU returns with a fun romp that is part family drama, part action adventure - and all MCU.Starring Scarlett Johansson, of course, as the titular character, BLACK WIDOW takes place after CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR and before AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, teams up with her ""other"" family to stop a team of enemy assasins.But, it's not the plot that we care about in these types of movies, it's the characters and the action. And this film brings both in abundance.Let's start with the characters - the 4 main ""family"" members - Johansson (Black Widow), Florence Pugh (Yelena), David Harbour (Alexei) and Rachel Weisz (Melina) are wonderful to spend time with. These are characters that I want to see on the screen and their interactions - though sometimes confrontational - is filled with friendship, respect and love. This is something that other ""universes"" don't quite get as well as the MCU and it shows.Johannson, of course, is terrific as Black Widow. She has this character down and if this is her last go around as this character, she'll got out with her head held high. David Harbour (STRANGER THINGS) is the comic relief of this film as his (somewhat) overweight superhero RED GUARDIAN, tries to fit into his old costume (reminiscent of MR. INCREDIBLE) while Rachel Weisz (Oscar winner for THE CONSTANT GARDNER) is the grounding/realistic character.But all 3 of these take a back seat to the terrific Florence Pugh (Oscar nominated for LITTLE WOMEN a few year's back) as the ""little sister"" of Black Widow. She and Johannson have terrific chemistry together and the writers/directors give Pugh most of the good lines that will lead the audience to be won over by her character.The only blemish I have in the performances of this film is Ray Winstone's rather ""average"" performance as the main bad guy in this film. I don't fault Winstone's performance, I think that it is because the part is underwritten or, worst yet, an afterthought of the writers.Director Cate Shortland (LORE) does a good job keeping the film moving while interspersing the family drama with the action and the humor at a brisk enough clip to keep your interest for the full 134 minutes of this film. It's a good return to the MCU and one that will keep you coming back for more.Which is EXACTLY what the MCU wishes you to do.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
1347,5,"My Least Favorite Marvel Movie Not only did this movie have a slow start it hardly kept my attention throughout the movie. The acting was fine I just didn't find the new characters very likable nor did I care what happened to them as the movie progressed.With the pandemic they had plenty of time to iron out flaws or issues with the movie and it didnt present itself that way, if anything it seemed rushed."
1348,4,"Marvel's Rock Bottom (I hope) 1/3 laughable ""take down the world dominator"" plot1/3 awkward comedy1/3 cringe-inducing (faux)family dramaThe absolute lowest point in the lifespan of Marvel Studios and the MCU."
1349,10,"amazing One of the best mcu movies. The dinamics bettwen nat and yelena made everything better, also one of thr best duos in the mcu."
1350,9,C'mon People This is a good flick! I had a great time. Good script. Good Acting. Good Direction. What do you expect?
1351,6,Good for kids This movie fits for kids better.. don't recommend.
1352,5,Scarlett Johansson passing the baton I don't like Marvel movies it's typical superheroes movies targeted to kids.. the plot and joke is very much the same plus The villain is always dumb and stupid..Let talks about this one the opening scene movie rocks there is a star there hahaSecondly Scarlet as black widow feels aged and lost the flame and the movie tries to pass the widow baton to another one which was played by Florence Pugh which is IMO irritating and annoying As F not too mention she can't really act I watch her a few times in Midsommer and little womanWhat were the casting director thinking??Casting Olga Kurylenko as the villain is by far the best thing for the movie but the character is so stupid and dumb once the mask is removedWhy can't marvel or Disney writes a villain which superior for once.Another 2 stars is given to Ray Winstone for his performance as Dreykov but still the the character was written so poorlyAnother star is given to Actor William hurt which is to me his performance is short but powerfulOverall 4.5 but rounded it up to 5 as expected of a marvel movie equals kiddie movie.
1353,1,"I was very disappointed !!!!!!! :( I'm a big fan of Marvel movies and I've watched them with great interest from the beginning. I've been waiting for this movie to come out for a long time and I was very disappointed after watching it. Very boring and ""dry"" scenarios. It's good that the cast is up to par, otherwise this rating is a lot. I guess it was intended for an American, children's and at the same time female audience.Otherwise it is not worth it!"
1354,10,"Awesome, loved it People giving this a 1? LOL. 1 is the lowest rating. If you give this a 1, where do you go for something that's actually terrible? Crazy. This movie rocks. It has great casting, awesome action, all the feels!!! Highly recommended. Whole family watched together (at home big screen) - age range 11 to 64 and everyone loved it."
1355,3,How did bw die ? I dont know how did she die in the end of the movie or in the universe they are in ? It was total surprise at the end of the movie. And especially that hawkeye killed her was another thing of what the heck. When Yelenna deserted why didnt her body suit self destruct like it did for the other widow who dropped from high up and broke her back ? Why Taskmaster was played trough out the movie as a male and only when mask is off was female ? Also this bad guy protection system was dumb and only to get past it was to break her nose like that will prevent you do sense any smells. This movie just have too much things in it that makes no sense. Like why Natasha started fight with her sister when they first met ? Like is that some sort of a family reunion thing or something we didnt see it even when they were young. Never mind that there age different at the start of the movie was like few years only and in the end was like 10 years or more. Why was Natasha fleeing from US government ? Why didnt the taskmaster just attack Natasha in the forest where Natasha had her trailer ? How did the Taskmaster find her in the bridge out of nowhere when the Lada Niva dont have anything electronic in it other then it's radio ? Never mind that it's really weird to see Lada Niva in Norway. This movie is just full of nonsenss problems after problems.
1356,8,"Scarlett johansen plays James Bond in Mission Impossible featuring the Terminator video The fist half of the movie was 9/10 awesome. The second part was a solid 7/10 (which is till very good , but it felt a bit like they weren't able to keep up the high octane mix from the start).Still, if you ever wanted to see what it would look like if James Bond, Mission Impossible and Terminator mzrced into one movie, this is a pretty way to spend a few hours."
1357,7,"Typical Superhero Movie. I don't know where all these 1s, 2s and 3s are coming from. This seemed like the typical superhero movie to me. Most of my superhero movie ratings started at 10 and went down to 6 because at first I was impressed with the action and special effects. But over time it just became the same old thing over and over again --- great action and special effects. Silly dialogue and plot. This movie is no different.My only real complaint is the same with all these superhero movies --- the sound. The loud parts are really loud. And the low volume parts are really low. I made the mistake of starting this move late on a week night in an apartment building. I didn't want to disturb the neighbors. So I was constantly running the volume up to 80/100 for the low volume parts. All the way down to 15/100 for the high volume parts. (I eventually just gave up and kept it around 20-25/100.)There are lots of heavy eastern European accents in this movie. And lots of mumbling, whispering and low talking. And of course lots of screaming, yelling, explosions and loud music. And I didn't have closed captioning available. So if I didn't miss half the dialogue, I missed more than half.But apparently it didn't really make any difference. I got the general story. Natasha Rominoff (Scarlett Johansson) was raised in a fake family of Russian spies with a mother, a father and a sister. They are based covertly in Ohio. Once their cover is blown, they escape to Cuba where immediately the two girls are put in a spy training program. And the parents return to their normal adult spy lives.21 years later, they find themselves back together again. The girls are resentful they didn't have a normal upbringing. After a family dinner --- where once again, I couldn't understand a word anybody was saying --- they all decide spylife ain't working for them anymore. And the head spy is kind of a jerk. So they plan to bring it all down, and kill the head spy. The rest is all action and special effects.I streamed this movie in high definition, and at a high speed. I thought the action and special effects were great. At least as good as any other superhero movie.7/10 for me. Not the best superhero movie. But definitely not the worst."
1358,8,"Unhappy Families Black Widow: Families - surrogate ones appear in all shapes and sizes in this film but they are all unhappy in their own ways. 1995, the original Black Widow, Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) and Red Guardian Alexi Shostakov (David Harbour) are undercove,r spying on SHIELD, accompanied by their young ""daughters"" Natasha and Yelena they flee when their cover is blown. Yelena and Natasha are sent to the Red Room to be trained as Black Widow assassins. So begins the tale of how this family reunites with Scarlet Johansson as the adult Natasha and Florence Pugh as Yelena. They fight a Cyborg and the Black Widows (as well as each other at first), they even have to spring Alex from prison. Fight scenes both mass and duels are impressively choreographed with CGI assistance in skydiving bouts. The evil General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) even has a Cloud Base HQ and as many lives as a cat. A moving tale, the ""sisters"" aren't just out for revenge, they want to free all of the Black Widows from mind control. Some gaps in the chronicles of the MCU are filled in and future adventures are promised with some interesting plot twists. Directed by Cate Shortland from a script by Eric Pearson. 8/10."
1359,7,"Not the most spectacular MCU movie, but great in its own way I could moan and groan here like the majority of the reviews on this page about this movie, instead I am going to review this movie at the perspective of the fan not the critic.First and foremost I am going to label this review with spoilers since I don't want anyone to view this before watching the movie.This is at the forefront a prequel movie in the MCU, something Marvel hasn't done in this type of context. Yes, Captain Marvel was technically a prequel, but it was a prequel before the main events of the MCU unfolded. Black Widow takes place in between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. Therefore, the movie does link in with what the audience already knows about what is going in the universe at this time. This movie doesn't spend too much time explaining that for this reason.The director and producers have said that they tried a new action filming style in this movie, and it shows. I don't know if I like it or hate it because I don't know if I would have noticed if I didn't know it was in the movie.As per most MCU movies, they try to lighten the mood of an otherwise very series movie with some sarcasm and jokes. I would say most of them hit home and connect with the audience with some of them seeming oddly timed and just plain flat. I don't think I would penalize them for that, especially since (in my opinion) the jokes that were used in the movie were never really offensive or politically driven. Which is still nice to see a movie where it isn't politically driven. Some may disagree with me on this given the antagonist of the film is a middle aged white man. I would disagree with you on this premise: we have known about this villain since the first Avengers movie. Since we already know about him I don't see this as a politically driven movie, especially since the villain is already mentioned in Natasha's backstory before we just haven't seen him on screen.Overall I think Dreykov was the right choice for a villain in this movie. Some may say they wish this plot was about Natasha and Clint's mission in Budapest, in which technically this movie actually does revolve around that mission. That Budapest mission is part of why this movie is so important to Natasha in the first place. We find out in this movie that Budapest was the final mission in Romanoff's defection to SHIELD back in the day by supposedly killing Dreykov and his daughter. We find out that was not what happened that day and the team goes about trying to find Dreykov and killing him.Also some may say that it seems Natasha was a sidekick in her own title movie. With that I mostly disagree since it does seem that a good amount of the focus of the movie is on Natasha. Now it is most obvious 5 minutes in that this will be more of a sister movie then a solo film given that most of the plot revolves around the sister relationship between Natasha and Yelena. In which I think this movie handles that plot point very well and allows both characters to build screen time and fill us in little by little on their backstory.I don't know if this film will stand the test of time when it comes to story quality. The story writers behind the film come from the MCU Disney+ entry side of things and it does show in some parts of the story. You can tell the writers have done more episodic entries before and not as many movies since some scenes in Black Widow feel cut and dry.We also seem to be in an age in the MCU right now where we are rebuilding some of our core heroes and this film helps to do that. Every Disney+ entry in the MCU right now either gives a true backstory to a hero or introduces a hero to a new role and this film does that as well. It sets up Yelena to eventually take on the Black Widow mantle on the Avengers or Secret Avengers one day.I did like this movie as a whole and while it was quite fun to see Natasha in a movie that didn't include other big characters in the MCU, it was also cool to see a new side of her as a sister to Yelena. I also quite liked how Yelena was introduced. She seems to be a light hearted version of Natasha and I think it works. Time will tell on that one.I hope you enjoyed the first MCU movie since 2019, I sure did and it was still a fun movie even if it has a few holes."
1360,4,"So average This movie had a really good opportunity to become a new level in the Marvel Universe. But it didn't do it.Nowadays people want to see not only popcorn superhero movies, they want to see strange movies, weird movies they want real dramas. If we say that people around the globe are customers, then we can say that customers are ready for serious movies about superheroes.Black Widow as a character had a lot of drama and terrifying moments in her past. And Disney could make a movie that could at least look like real.In this movie two main characters talk about their inability to have a kid like it's nothing, like it's ok for them. And it's just one moment of many others. This movie is so average... so childish. Looks like the company wants as much money as possible so any rating is unacceptable, any drama in the movie is unacceptable, anything that can make a customer sad is unacceptable.Sad but true."
1361,2,Is it Really a Marvel Movie? Disappointed and No strong story. Trying to club the all super hero powers and made something which is not upto the mark.
1362,10,cried during the whole thing I wonder what brought the people who voted 3 to 0 starts to be so mad.
1363,1,"Terrible, predictable utter garbage If this was a movie with super heroes, with super powers, I could overlook the lack of respect towards gravity, sense, logic or whatever.As it stands, it's another Marvel movie, with impossible stunts, indestructible human beings, lack of expected damage, logical and sense.A show of vehicle destruction, explosions and non-stop imbecile ilogical action, presented by Disney.I stopped after half an hour, no sense in burning more brain cells with yet another overused female special agent story, done again and again in the past, this time with even more impossible action and poor script.As long as you fast your seatbelt, under Disney's protection bubble, you are in for some gravity defying moves... it's just not for me, games are more enjoying than watching movies that look like games."
1364,6,"It was ok It was ok. It's Preety much just a worse version of winter soldier. Taskmaster is worse Bucky, Drake is worse Alexander pierce, And the 3rd act is worse Then that movie's 3rd act. Preety Much all i have to say. Hopefully Shang chi is better."
1365,7,"Entertaining The movie has a great female cast. The action is quite realistic and high speed martial arts scenes. I watched the viewing at Cineworld on the 4dx screen which gave added oomph to the experience. It's worth a watch, a good action movie with decent developing storyline."
1366,8,"Great Storyline and Great Marvel Movie I've been really burnt out on super hero movies even though I've been a super hero movie addict since X-Men! But I have to say, I really enjoyed this. It's no 10 Star Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's better than Half the Marvel movies out there!"
1367,10,"Worth the wait! Really enjoyed this movie, the chemistry between Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansen is awesome, they really feel like sisters. Great vfx and awesome action scenes. Loved it!"
1368,6,"Ultimately disappointing Let me start by saying I really didn't want to to hate this movie, Black Widow is a fantastic character and one of the most popular ones in the MCU, who always had the intriguing backstory the people wanted to hear about. But unfortunately this film just doesn't do the character justice, especially as a send off for her.The film is best described in one word ""Meh"". At no point did I really feel invested in this movie, and that mainly felt due to it being a prequel, so you knew she was in no danger at any time, even when she is the room with all the other widows near the end.The film tries to be smarter than it is and emulate the winter soldier, which is admirable, but doesn't come close unfortunately. There are far to many unanswered questions in the film too - for example, the plot revolves around widows who, in response to Natasha leaving the organization of her own free will, are now being mind controlled but a drug, including Natasha's ""sister"" Yelena, who manages to be injected with the antidote and thus tries to bring down the Red room with Natasha, whilst being chased down by Taskmaster...Who developed the antidote? Don't knowWho gave it to the black widow who dies at the start? No idea.Why did Yelena send Natasha clues to meet up, only to try and kill her when she meets her at the safehouse? Who knows?Why is Taskmaster.... well why is Taskmaster! I'll come to that shortly...The supporting cast of characters are okay, Yelena is a good character and played well, and there are some good scenes between the two, the Red Guardian unfortunately starts off well enough in the flashback scene at the start of the film, however once we cut to present day he is played as the idiot comedy relief for the rest of the film. I won't try and turn this in to a sexist debate, but the film has about 3 males in it, and none of them are really portrayed well, and Mileena is just there really, she has no character development and is shown to be a fairly evil woman who has developed the mind control drug, tortures animals at her own farm, yet get no comeuppance in the movie. Other than Yelena I can't say I really warmed to any of the others.Now, on to the villans....Dreykov - the big bad russian boss of the red room. Who should play such a role that would require a strong russian accent? Who better than Ray Winstone.... Now, I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but the only accents I feel he can comfortably pull off are ""cockney"", and ""cockney"". Whilst he does have screen presence, his scenes were just painful to watch as he had such a bad accent you couldn't take him seriously! The character is barely onscreen so you get no real idea of his threat level and why he is such a bad man, which in fairness is well pointed out by Natasha during their scenes at the end, however the fact that he has somehow got some pheromones that stop the widows attacking him is ridiculous - step back a few metres and shoot the guy!And now we come to (Sigh) Taskmaster... one of the most anticipated villains in the Marvel catalogue - Antony Masters, a mercenary who possesses photographic reflexes and that allow him to mimic any fighting style and has bested many of Marvel's best - nope! Not this one! This one is no other than a mind controlled woman. Given the obvious reveal of who this is, this wouldn't be so bad if they had actually used a female stunt woman for the him instead of clearly having a man do all the scenes! I don't know if this was done to throw people off for the reveal or not, but it was so infuriating! I was really looking forward to seeing how Natasha would use her skills to beat ""him"" in the end and was ultimately massively disappointed.Overall I feel this film was a story that just didn't need telling - aside from Yelena none of the characters in the film will be seen again in the MCU, and no one will care about that either. I for one would have much rather have seen an origin story about how Black Widow and Hawkeye and how he was sent to kill her but changed his mind and ultimately convinced her to switch allegiances, and explored the Budapest reference."
1369,9,"time well spent The ""Russian family"" vibe was quite accurate, was super fun to watch and hear as certain phrases of Alexei were word-for-word quotes of my father. Overall, enjoyed it tremendously, actors and actresses were 10/10, their acting was truly impressive, what a great job... the storyline was also pretty good, but since the movie takes place ""in the past"" it was a bit easy to predict the end or not worry too much about Natasha. Would love to see a sequel."
1370,4,"Marvel makes great characters by assasinating other characters I am also a fan of marvel, but they make other characters to boost up other's story track Eg: hulk k.o by thanos Prof.hulk World war hulk comics for ragnarok Taskmaster gender swapped(he is a great mecenary) I dont know how this continues."
1371,10,Incredible One of the best Marvel films to date. I loved every second of it. Florence Pugh is Black Widows sister and I have now fell in love with her haha. Scarlett did incredible as per usual as well. I loved the mainly female cast and I recommend everyone to watch it.
1372,5,"Not the best Marvel movie. I think the movie is just another example of ""wasted opportunity"" for a character who has been of great importance in the now concluded Infinity Saga. Boring, predictable, bad script and bad CGI, absurd scenes for a ""not enhanced character"", and useless banter every few minutes. Scarlett has done better as Nat in the past. Yelena/Pugh is annoying most of the time. The character of Harbour is the most embarrassing and useless in the movie and together with Rachel Weisz they are the top one useless duo in the story. Their fake russian accent is ridiculous and their roles in the end are not even necessary. The role of the Taskmaster has been completely changed without reason. The cringe is a serious problem for 3/4 of the movie. The dialogues are not interesting, there is a very high risk of making the viewer fall asleep during more than one occasion (it happened to me). As a big marvel fan I can say that I am disappointed with this product, definitely not what I would have expected after all the waiting. Underwhelming and over the top at the same time, too long and boring, the inconsistency of many scenes, put there for the solely purpose of filling the cosmic void of an hopeless screenplay, is a great disappointment. The script seems to be written by amateurs."
1373,3,"Woke and plain stupid This film is an enormous disappointment and fails for being woke with gratuitous female power and a male lead (David Harbour) as the big clown and sidekick. Hey let's make an example of male stupidity in this movie! While the overall acting was decent, Rachel Weisz's performance was rather lackluster, ""Russian"" accents weren't consistently Russian, the CGI was cringeworthy, and the tone was blatantly gender-biased. There is plenty of unbelievable action and zero-latency injury recovery times that mortals (for the main characters) experience."
1374,7,"Bulletproof Women The Movie - good fun! Didn't know Natascha was as indestructible as Cap 'murica, but as soon as you accept that, the action of this movie is quite fun most of the time. Pugh totally steals Johansson's spotlight. Don't get me wrong: though I'm not a fan of Johansson herself, I always felt weirdly sympathetic to her character, though in this movie the Widow feels more shallow and uninteresting than ever before. Liked the more griddy style of the movie that is set up right at the opening credits and keeps pretty steady throughout the runtime. Also cool to see women carry the plot and the villain's goons being only women for a change. Music and CGI could have been better. Also would have wished for the Taskmaster to be on screen more."
1375,10,I loved it was about 2 sisters- The humor and cool rivalry and fight scenes. Pretty action packed. The sub parents. Hilarious.Great back story about Black Widow and her sister.
1376,5,"Storyline not so interesting Script was poorly done. Storyline wasn't that interesting. The acting part... so-so. I felt like Marvel franchise wants to make more profit, so they keep producing these not so good quality movie."
1377,3,$3 movie for a $30 price Starts off hot the fizzle and drizzles! Wait for it to hit Disney plus on your subscription and don't pay the extra $30 for a $3 roll over. Disappointed to say the least.
1378,6,"A good marvel movie, not the greatest.... The movie was great. Great bg, action packed scenes. The cinematography nd direction was the best... Plot could have been better. The villain is not given enough exposure, not so much is shown about Natasha's past unlike where I expected a hell lot of about it .. how did she join shield? How did she escape the red room ? What about the dance sequels shown in age of ultrons? Not so much is shown about Budapest nd Natasha's operation with Clint in Budapest... while I don't expect endgame level movie but Natasha deserved a better farewell...."
1379,10,"Will watch again I've read a lot of the reviews and there are mixed reviews. I'm not going to give away and spoilers this time the only thing I will say that from start to finish it's action packed, a little comedy, & will keep your attention. LOVED IT!!"
1380,8,"I STILL GRIEVE FOR HER TORTURED SOUL I still can't believe they killed off this amazing character... SHE DESERVED SO MUCH MORE... IT WAS A VERY ENJOYABLE FILM, I JUST WISHED THEY SHOWED HER TRAINING IN BECOMING THE LETHAL FIGHTING MACHINE SHE TRULY WAS."
1381,7,Worth the watch RATED 7/10 Language: EnglishAnother Marvel hero's beginning story... its filled with good amount of fun and action... Not boring one... but not exceptional also... Worth the watch...
1382,9,"MCU back to form After the utter trash that was Captain Marvel I was skeptical about this one, but it was wonderful the whole way through. It had everything in it I enjoy about Marvel films. Stellar all the way through."
1383,4,Too much special affects... Why Marvel thinks the audience are stupid?Story is not so attractive. Actions are not so good. Too much special affects made it fantasy.
1384,8,"Nicely Creative, Humorous, Action Packed, and Intimate Assassin Movie with a Derivative First Third of the Movie Scarlett Johansson stars in this more assassin-trending than superhero action thriller. The beginning and second half of the movie offered up a nice creative, refreshing introduction and building action climax that basically hit the right buttons. Some audience members may have appreciated a little better plot development in the beginning as scenes rapidly proceeded apace with the mental catch-up game for some people trying to figure out what was happening even as the opening sequences were nicely done as the action became quite compelling and original without super-hyper drive special effects. The movie then however became a little stilted with the hyper-action that seemed overdone and quite derivative using many action sequences done before in many movies. Yet the screenwriters, directors, and actors redeem themselves well with a powerful second half of the movie with nice double twists, humor, and emotionally touching interludes as a family or what might be called a family. With elements from Gemini Man (2019) and the Russian trained assassin moles genre going back to the original classic La Femme Nikita (1990) and Soldier (1998), Black Widow succeeds for the most part."
1385,9,Loved it It was a great movie and while it wasn't as focused on Scarlett Johanson as I thought it was going to be it is still an awesome movie! 😁
1386,8,"Average MCU movie, still good Where's all the hate for this movie coming from?? It's not bad at all lmao. In fact it's quite good imo. Great action, pretty good characters, a meh story that still worked for me, a great post-credit scene, and like 30 @ss shots. I may be overrating this because I'm a big marvel fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this. Also saw it in a theater with a friend which made it better. One of my complaints however is how they handled Taskmaster. I would've preferred they stuck to the comics and made her look cooler (like the comics) and didn't go for the gender swap twist. But other than that, I think it was a very formidable story for Natasha after the events of Captain America: Civil War, and fits amazingly into the MCU timeline."
1387,5,".. maybe just not for me..? The acting in the movie was great, I am fluent in Russian, and my whole family is from there, but I could barely understand a word they said in Russian, the english as well was just as hard to understand, they had strong accents in both of the languages, the movie felt very jumpy, I was confused on what was going on half of the time, and my friend fell asleep towards the end, the storyline was very random, and the editing wasn't all that good either, I haven't watched many Marvel movies though, so maybe I'm just not grasping something??? Personally I was waiting for this movie to be over the whole two hours, it felt like a chore to watch after my friend bought us tickets, since I didn't want to be rude. Maybe the character arch and storyline was better understood by other people because they were marvel fans in general and had already memorized some of the names and what the hell was going on, but me personally, I didn't get half of the things that were happening, having watched only some marvel movies before, I can say for certain that they were better than this."
1388,2,2 for Pugh So boring :( no Russian person wanted to be in this movie obviously. No dialect coaches either? Mila jovovic's daughter was a good touch but too short screen time.
1389,3,"Over rated for what it is, a teenage movie This surely can't be aimed at adults?Rather poor movie, with so many lazy plots and cliche after another."
1390,1,Boring as hell I do like a good superhero flic. This was not the case. 10minutes in and it completely lost me. Began fiddling with the phone to pass the time and 5 minutes after that just turned it off because I didn't do anything bad to no one and no one deserves to watch this.It wasn't a disappointment because I really had no high hopes for it but it's still disappointing to see marvel waste money on this.
1391,7,"love seeing some bad ass woman in action roles Amazing movie, Scarlett and Florence did an amazing job portraying bad ass females with a lot of action as well as being able to have a laugh while doing it."
1392,3,"Not every Avenger... ...deserves their own story, and this one proves the case. Stunts are great as are FX, but otherwise unremarkable and even boring. The new girl, however, was a big treat on all levels."
1393,6,Average and boring movie Unnecessary harangue and monologues. Not a typical MCU movie. Next time I won't go by Marvel logo.
1394,3,"Sloppy narration. Does not add anything to the MCU. Disappointing CGI, considering the budget. Disney generated a lot of hype for this movie, considering that it was postponed more than once. The trailer really got me and I thought that Marvel was attempting to make some kind of spy story. There is even a short quote to the classic 007 in the film, but it doesn't even come close to Fleming's work. I am always happy when a company decides to make a franchise flick about a secondary character, that may expand the narrative universe, but in this case nothing is really added to the MCU and this was a perfectly avoidable movie for several reasons:The narration is below expectations. Natasha's story is not really deepened, if not for a short intro that is clearly not enough to develop this character. There are way too many shootouts, fights and chases to the point where it becomes very chaotic and out of line. The few dialogues are, in most cases, ridiculous. Tons of situations that do not make any sense: Natasha and Yelena are human beings that received special training, not superheroes. Nevertheless they are completely immune to explosions or car accidents. They always get out with very few scratches, and they always win with no much effort. There is no tension, no real struggling moments for Romanoff's family. The plot twist during the last section of the movie is pretty much disappointing. As always there are also tons of forced comedy moments that nobody asked for.Considering the 200 millions dollars budget, the CGI is not good enough: fire and explosions animations are awful, the quality level of special effects in some sequences is comparable to the one of Matrix Reloaded, which was released in 2003. Seems like that there was no technology advancement in these last 20 years. Most of the scenes are over the top and completely unrealistic. I wonder who studied the physics and the dynamics for this movie, because the job done in this department is clearly very sloppy.""Black Widow"" could have been a different movie, a spy story with intrigues and more practical stunt sequences, like ""John Wick"". Marvel here just went lazy and they lost a big opportunity, but they clearly do not care, as this was in fact a commercial success. Results may not be astonishing like ""Endgame"", but they still managed to cover production costs, so why even care about fans?"
1395,10,"Hilarioussss, I was hesitant to watch this I was hesitant to watch this because super hero Movies have been boring lately. Besides I didn't think black widow would've been any interest but I was sooo wrong. Just watch it, it's hilarious and really interesting and entertaining."
1396,4,"Below average First 15 minutes look promising... From then on, it goes down the mountain....Bad movie."
1397,8,"Muito bom A história é boa, muito interessante e com aquele toque de sentimentalismo, familia, traição e tal. Vale a pena assistir."
1398,7,I actually loved this movie. Tbh I am more of a fan of the heroes' own films instead of all the heroes together in one film. Scarlett was great in this film and so was everyone else. I loved hearing her story and a few scenes got me emotional. The only thing I didn't like was the last battle but everything else I really enjoyed. 7 out of 10.
1399,4,"It is Marvel. Although I did not have very high expectations for this movie I did not expect it to be this disappointing. I most admit though it is a marvel movie and it had its memorable moments, but the disappointment outweighed the memorable parts tremendously. And not to mention a complete change to one of my most beloved super villains."
1400,6,"The movie is good, but... ....the anti-communism propaganda was completely unecessary. Why painting the USA's secret agencies as saints and the URSS's as pure evil?Despite that, the movie has good acting, interesting new characters, a good villain, a good twist. The plot is a bit too simple."
1401,8,"Ultimately a movie that works on its own terms. It's ultimately a movie that works on its own terms, a long overdue enrichment of the story of a beloved character that will make his ultimate sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame even more powerful in hindsight.Every blockbuster this summer is touted as a sign the world has returned to normal Black Widow The movie is more of a reminder of what fans loved before it strayed from its axis."
1402,8,GoodGood. Good Good. Good. Good. Good Good. Good.Good. Good Good. Good. Good. Good Good. Good. Good. Good Good. Good. Good. Good Good. Good. Good. Good Good. Good. Good. Good Good. Good.
1403,7,"Not a bad movie but disjointed, slow paced with glaring plot holes The movie is OK, but because of of the topic material I thought it would be more dark, but they force in ""Marvel Humor."" not Deadpool style humor, and it destroys the tone. IE the movie takes itself seriously, but wants us to laugh. The CGI was decent, but I'm not sure if it was not up to par, or if the movie was too reliant on them. IE in a normal Marvel movie the special effects are just there. In this movie they jump out at you, and are very noticeable. The one thing I hated the most was the flashbacks. These are not typical flash backs in that they show motivation or background information. These flash backs show you how they accomplished certain things, and comes across more as an ass pull."
1404,7,"This movie was good, not great but good While yes of course it could have been better and yes it wasn't as good as something like endgame. This movie had the action to keep you entertained and it definitely had an interesting story with it, this movie was also operating in a small gap between civil war and infinity war it didn't have a lot of room to work. I found it entertaining and enjoyable, while there were flaws I'm not going to waste my time trying to pick apart this movie. If your thinking of a movie to watch I'd suggest this."
1405,7,"Better than I expected Master killer 'The Black Widow' (Natasha Romanov, played by Scarlett Johansson) is finally given a solo film, complete with back-story, as she reunites with her 'family' to take on a supervillain who controls an army of brainwashed über-assassins. The film, especially CGI/special effects and action sequences, doesn't add much new to the Marvel cinematic universe but the story moves along and there is some amusing meta-humour at the expense of well-worn hero-tropes (notably the three point power-landing) and on the oft ridiculed contribution of master assassin, but otherwise mundane, 'Black Widow' to 'The Avengers', a team that includes omnipotent supernatural beings, Gods, and Hulks. The script is a bit light-weight and quippy, especially when Romanov's father shows up, which makes some of the 'family bonding' scenes a bit uneven, but the two 'sisters' seem to have fun with their roles (Florence Pugh is quite good as Yelena). The opening sequence and credits are excellent as is much of the first half but the film falters somewhat when the action moves to the villain's improbable aerial secret-base and resorts to the much parodied shtick of the evil-doer carefully explaining his nefarious plans before an overly-long and physics-defying climatic fight. Other than some heavy-handed 'sister-hood' bonding at the end, I failed to see the 'feminist agenda' that some IMDB commentators seem fixated on. Having read a lot of on-line amateur reviews (such as the one I am writing), I was prepared for pretentious crap at the level of 'Captain Marvel' (2019) , so was presently surprised by this entertaining, if not outstanding, CGI-fest."
1406,7,"Enjoyable, but all the emotion is drowned out by the excessive action Note: Spoilers are in paragraph 6. The rest of the review is spoiler-freeI'm a huge MCU fan and I've been looking forward to this for a while. Unfortunately, it wasn't everything I hoped it would be.The main cast is excellent. Scarlett, Florence, David, and Rachel play off each other wonderfully and it's very fun to watch.Like I said in the title, the biggest flaw here is the action. After a 25 minute opening there isn't as much time to do stuff so they need to get straight to the character development and the plot. However, there are so many action sequences that the movie never gets a chance to touch on much else. Once the prolouge ends, there are literally 3 fights in the span of 30 minutes. Not just that, but the fights take up most of that time. It goes like this: Fight scene - 2 minutes of talking - Fight scene - 5 minutes explaining the villian and the plot - Fight scene. The action takes time away from characters and other things a movie needs to have for it to be good. The Natasha vs Yelena fight (fight is in the trailer so this isn't a spoiler) didn't even need to happen. They could've skipped that fight and nothing would've changed.The special effects weren't always the best, but considering this was supposed to come out almost 2 years ago I'll give that a pass.I did enjoy the story and the action, although there is a lot, it was fun which is important considering it's a superhero movie. The soundtrack was also really enjoyable and the opening credits were creepy as hell. The jokes land most of the time as well.Taskmaster was terrible. First, literally all the stuff she does is in the trailer so whenever she is on screen its never exciting because you know everything that's about to happen. Also, all the scenes where Taskmaster copies other heroes (Hawkeye, Black Panther, ect.) are shown in the trailers as well so once again theres nothing exciting when she does it because you already know it's going to happen. Lastly, what were they thinking getting rid of Tony Masters and replacing him with a girl? To be clear, I'm not sexist and I have no problem with genderbending if it's done well, but they absolutely butcher the version of Taskmaster in the comics. Even the Mandarin twist in Iron Man 3 was better than this. And then they are going to give her a redemption arc? They've been doing that with a lot of villians lately (Ghost, Karli, Loki, etc) and it's starting to get old.Unfortunately this is one of the weaker entries in the MCU. Definitely not the worst but there are a lot of better films in the franchise. Any big fans of Taskmaster will be disappointed, but it's still and enjoyable movie."
1407,7,"5-star would be an underestimate. Okay action, okay score, not bad performance.Overall it's your average Marvel movie."
1408,7,"A ""First-Time"" made BLACK WIDOW movie! if not, what about a ""REMAKE VERSION"" Lets ignore all the negative comments about the black widow FIRST-TIME MADE movie except the Task-Master as a hidden wrong used-wasted character did not fit in the movie by serious 'marvel's comic book fans...' i am going to be honest with my views opon the movie;-the black widow action hand-to-hand fighting choreagraphy was not BAD AT ALL it was Fun & entertaining also the gun shooting parts alongside with that.-the director & film writers should have shown & look inside of NATASHA & YELENA orphanage childhood life story alot more! With more details of ""how they were being trained to become Russian Secret Assassin Spies"" in russia as little kids being kidnapped & trained by some evil russian undercover owner of the RED ROOM soviet armed force named: Dreykov. This film could have been 3 HOURS LONGER THAN 2 HOURS! If the film showed more details inside Natasha & yelena childhood life story.-storyline of each character was was interesting with there own personality ways of acting from the comic book but wish it show the origin story of each main characters inside the movie MORE!-the scripts for the characters was not bad at all some were funny as yelena & some were serious such as natasha herself.-what was fun with the adventurous moments is when natasha travel to different countries to do different business missions with yelena or solo!ALL-IN-ALL the movie was that bad at all it was a funny & fun, emotional ,adventurous movie be could have been BETTER if the main Villian Task-master was a MALE character from the comic book & also if it show more DETAILS of both natasha & yelena Childhood life story alot more! Like inside the origin story of natasha from the comic book.-its possible this movie could have a REMAKE VERSION to show more DETAILS of the black widows childhood life story of how they became the widows assassin spies..."
1409,6,"I mean it's good Now, this is not marvel's best movie however it is nice to see the first female avenger have her own movie (which is definitely very late). It's funny but I think the only scene that is important for upcoming projects is the end credits as Black Widow is dead."
1410,10,"soooo good<3 I love itttt , i cried while watching it. I can't think of words to say its just perfect."
1411,10,Black Widow Black Widow is a very emotional and epic movie! I love this movie. Its a perfect end for Natasha Romanoff...
1412,7,"Even ""THE TOMORROW WAR"" is better than BLACK WIDOW 1) It's a good film. But not as good as marvel movie. It's an average action movie like Tom Cruise's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE or Fast and Furious series.2) 1st ever MCU movie which have a very normal villain.3) From marvel we 1st expect super powers. But in this film there are nothing like super powerful action.4) Everyone knows that it's a action film. But it's not have so much action. 80% of this film is about family emotional."
1413,2,"Marvel, why?? They should've taken the money that they used for this movie and gave her her own Disney+ show, I feel like that would've been a much better use of those resources. It feel like everything was rushed and sloppily thrown together in a money grab effort, The Black Widow's story is capable of being much better than this..."
1414,7,Heart of a hero This movie has a lot of great emotion and heart. It shows the struggle of Natasha as she works to come to terms with her past. Her bonds and interactions with her adoptive sister feels like how real siblings act. Also red guardian steals every scene he is in. Highly recommend.
1415,3,"I'm just fed up at this point. Before you shout at me, I want to say I'm not opposed to the empowerment or women in any way shape or form: I think it's very bizarre that such a thing like gender inequality even exists in the modern era.There's not a but for this. I'm not gonna say it's wrong. Personally though, I have no clue why Marvel feels the need to start tackling political topics. I get it, they want to be informative, and that's great, I respect that; but they're a company which makes superhero films. I can't speak for other people, but I don't have fictional characters as my idols now, but as a child I would. But even then, how am I going to understand the fact that the Falcon gets racial discrimination? I just don't see the point. Why would I go to watch a film about a superhero to learn to respect women, and why would I watch something because its main attraction for audiences is the fact that it's left wing and politically sound with decent human standards? It's not a bad thing, but I don't want to be lectured when I already understand that women should have equal rights no questions asked. In short, while I liked the action and thought it was more structured than the Falcon and the Winter borefest, it annoys me that Marvel can't just let women and men and all races and sexualities be equal in a regular way (normalising it) rather than having to go out their way to say ""Hey look, it's a female! Now we should all know being a female is cool, but females go through a struggle every day!"" It isn't appealing to me certainly, and judging by the reviews, it appeals to some people, but not everyone, which seems to be different from most Marvel Films. If you want a good classic Marvel show or film with a female protagonist , just go and watch WandaVision and save your money."
1416,9,"A great sendoff for Scarlett's Black Widow ""Black Widow"" is an amazing rollercoaster of a film that delivers on fronts the MCU had never seen before! Scarlett Johansson was well overdue for her own movie being one of the original Avengers. It is just unfortunate that it comes after her death in ""Endgame"" but as I said, this movie knocks it out of the park with its action scenes, emotional drama and also sets up for future MCU implications. The core cast all did amazing work! Most notable is Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova. Her character has grown to be a hardened assassin from childhood who you think would be very dry but Pugh still manages to have amazing personality and surprisingly great comedic timing. Johansson serves as a great driver of the film and foil to Pugh's assist which makes for a very fun dynamic duo. The film is overrall great and exactly the epic adventure we all needed to drive everyone back to the theatre. This is an experience that should be seen on the big screen for sure even though it is offered through the Disney+ app as premiere access. If you want a spy movie that adds that patented MCU flair, I highly suggest going out to see ""Black Widow"""
1417,10,you guys are so nega! Leave your brain and enjoy the show your too serious life is too short you don't like it then shut up!!
1418,5,"Odd timing aside it's alright Skip It. It's a lot different compared to the compelling, Thrill-ride, Funny and Coherent stories Marvel are. It's less funny. Less thrilling then most of them. The fight scenes were fun though. And the Acting was fine. It's decent. I'm a Marvel fan but I think this is average your son and dad ladies will be disappointed.Overall 5/10."
1419,8,Mildly funny characters. I never followed the comic & only know about Black Widow from the Marvel movies.8/10The first half of the movie feels like more talking with a little action. Kind of like Wonder Woman 84. Establishing relationships for heartfelt moments down the track.The dialogue is funnier in Russian English & hits the mark a few times. I would actually watch it again for these moments with these characters.Plus some beautiful scenery & ladies fighting in Iycra suits is good viewing.The action scenes are Marvel inspired.
1420,8,"Black Widow The Marvel Cinematic Universe had its huge financial success with Avengers: Endgame, and then we had Spider-Man: Far from Home to continue the franchise, but we had to wait over a year for the next instalment, which brought back a departed character for her own solo adventure. Basically, in 1995, young Natasha Romanoff (Ever Anderson) and Yelena Belova (Violet McGraw) were raised in Ohio by surrogate parents, Russian undercover agents, super-soldier Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), aka the Red Guardian, Russia's Captain America, and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz). The family are forced to escape to Cuba, General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) takes Romanoff and Belova to the Red Room for training. Years later, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia, while Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) defects to S. H. I. E. L. D. after bombing Dreykov's Budapest office, apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). In 2016, after the Avengers have parted ways (Civil War), Romanoff is a fugitive, escaped from U. S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason (O-T Fagbenle). Meanwhile, Belova (Florence Pugh) kills a rogue former Black Widow but encounters a synthetic gas called Red Dust that neutralises control of her mind. Belova sends the antidote to Romanoff hoping that she will return to help her free the other Widows. Romanoff unknowingly drives off with Red Dust, she is attacked by deadly masked agent Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) who wants the antidote. After evading Taskmaster, she realises that the antidote came from Belova. The two reunite in Budapest, where they are attacked by mind-controlled Black Widows. While escaping, Romanoff learns Dreykov is alive, and the Red Room is still active. Romanoff was haunted by the memory of detonating the building with young Antonia inside whilst targeting Dreykov. Romanoff and Belova evade Taskmaster and meet back up with Mason who supplies them with a helicopter. Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn where Dreykov is, and he tells them that they need to speak to Vostokoff. On a farm outside Saint Petersburg, Vostokoff has experimenting with chemical mind control on pigs. There, Belova reveals that while they were not a real family, she believed they were so. Vostokoff admits she sent their location to Dreykov, and soon agents arrive and take them to the Red Room, an aerial facility. On the base, it is revealed that Vostokoff and Romanoff have switched places using face mask technology before they were captured, allowing Vostokoff to free Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Meanwhile, Romanoff confronts Dreykov, who sees through her disguise. Romanoff learns Taskmaster is Antonia, who survived the explosion but suffered severe damage. Dreykov implanted a chip in her head, turning her into the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees, including several Avengers. Romanoff attempts to kill Dreykov but fails to harm him due to a pheromone lock installed in her and every Widow. Dreykov reveals that he controls Widows worldwide via his desk console. Romanoff intentionally breaks her nose, severing her nasal passage to avoid the pheromone, and then attacks Dreykov. Shostakov battles Taskmaster, while Vostokoff destroys one of the facility's engines, and Belova searches for the other Widows, who are controlled to protect Dreykov. Together, Shostakov and Belova lock Taskmaster in a cell. Dreykov escapes as the Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova explodes an antidote bomb that releases all the Widows from mind control. Romanoff gets into the control desk and copies the locations of the other Widows around the world as the facility begins to explode and fall. Romanoff retrieves the two surviving vials of the Red Dust and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape in a plane just as Belova takes out Dreykov's helicopter, killing him. Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster in freefall. After landing, Romanoff uses the antidote on Taskmaster, freeing her from servitude. The freed Widows arrive as Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff. She gives Belova the last antidote vial and the portable drive, telling her to free all other still mind-controlled Widows. As they leave with Antonia, Romanoff awaits Ross and his men, who have arrived to apprehend her. Two weeks later, Romanoff reunites with Mason, who supplies her with a Quinjet; she intends to free the imprisoned Avengers. In a scene set after Romanoff's death, Belova meets Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) at Romanoff's grave. De Fontaine assigns Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), whom she claims is responsible for Romanoff's death, as Belova's next target. Also starring Liani Samuel as Lerato and Michelle Lee as Oksana. Johansson carries the film as the superspy, Pugh is a welcome new addition as the no-nonsense assassin with deadpan putdowns, boorish Harbour and mysterious Weisz offer great support, and Winstone is a little pantomime but not a bad villain. This answers the question from Avengers Assemble about the infamous Budapest mission, it a good story with spies and mind-control, with a witty script, there are plenty of fantastic special effects-ladened chase and fight sequences to feast your eyes on, and it leaves room for emotional and funny moments (mocking the ""pose"" is a great in-joke) as well, a terrific superhero fantasy action. Very good!"
1421,10,OMG!! The action in this movie is amazing. It was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to see what marvel has to offer with the rest of there movie and shows!
1422,8,"Don't read the reviews, just watch it I enjoyed it a lot. It's not the perfect movie, but for an action movie combined with the Marvel Universe background - it's great."
1423,4,"Disappointing even by Marvel's usual (low) standards I had a lot of issues with the movie that even the usual ""MCU Magic"" couldn't save it well.Soundtrack: Non-existent, unmemorable not special. It felt like some random loyal-free music could have done a better job than that. The Score is so unmemorable that it is hard to recall it even after 5 mins of ending the movie. There were annoying sonic boom SFX whenever a name of a city was shown or even if someone outright stepped out of a car, it felt annoying. And some of the songs are not even suitable for the movie, During the opening scenes when Natasha and Yelena were forcibly taken to the red-room a very generic and random slow song was played, it was not only annoying but took the essence of the dark, gritty scene away from me. Also, it had cheap thrills by Sia in it.Plot: This movie is almost a rehash of Captain America Winter Soldier. Both the movies had their main character on the run and their mission was to end some international secret espionage organization. The Main Character has a partner to help him/her in the mission (Yelena in Black Widow, Black Widow in Winter Soldier). But that is not enough, they will need more people to help extract info about the organization (Red Guardian and Melina in this case; Falcon in Winter Soldier). Both the villains are mere humans with a brainwashed assassins who share a history with the main character (Taskmaster in Black Widow; Bucky in Winter Soldier). Both the final battle take place in an aircraft which comes crashing down as a consequence of the fight. Too much resemblance. There were many stupid moments in the movie as well like when Natasha was sent the red anti-dot by Yelena and when Yelena meets Natasha in Budapest they have a fight scene, why? Both of them know that both why they were there right then why did they have to fight? Also, it is very convenient the it was the protagonist's ""fake"" parents who were closely tied to the Red Room. The jokes in the movie are not funny and feel very forced. Another stupid thing I noticed is the slow walking of the Task Master, if that guy knew how to run then this movie would have ended in the first 20 mins but Plot convenience saves the day. Black Widow as per known is a mere human with good fighting abilities yet she got out of some really questionable scenes, one scene she fell from 5 stories crashing into metal pipes without any much of damage? How!? There were many occasions when cars in which Black Widow was seated in exploded or overturned and fell on its head yet she survives?! No explanation for that. The plot was predictable to a major extent within the first 30 mins. Another Stupid scene I remembered was when Both Natasha and Yelena revealed much of the secret information in a public store! Sure, it didn't have any effect on the movie itself but it was stupid of spies to do that in public, and this was followed by another awkward and forced joke. The tone of this movie very inconsistent in my opinion, one moment it is some dark gritty movie with murder and kidnapping and next moment we have Red Guardian talking about his fishing days.Characters/Acting:The movie had a stellar cast yet it failed to deliver much of it. Scarlett Johansson nodded a lot and that I can remember, she has been doing this for 10 years so she was just like how she was supposed to be. Florence Pugh was undeniable the best amongst the ones we got. She was well written and her acting was convincing. The Villain appeared for 2 mins in the beginning and then straight had probably a 15 min appearance towards the end and died an underwhelming death. Not well written at all. Taskmaster was wasted. Taskmaster is an intimidating character in the comics but in the movie, they basically made him a mouth-shut assassin who walks really slowly when the opposite is needed. Red Guardian was wasted as well. He was used as a comic relief character but the jokes were LAME. Melina was well underwhelming. None but Yelena's character was at least decent.Other issues:The forgettable dialogue and fight scenes. Marvel realized how lackluster this movie actually is so the definite choice was to include some unwanted fight scenes. Jail Break and Yelena Natasha fight scene are prime examples. (Also, when Yelena and Natasha were having the fight in a residential apartment, did you know bother to hear or wonder what the hell was going on in the neighbor's room). Even the VFX in some scenes were awful which is surprising coming from a Marvel Movie.Redeeming qualities:Florence Pugh's performance has to be a redeeming quality of the movie. Despite all the issues, this movie did keep me invested in it. Lot of people are complaining that this is a boring movie but I disagree with that. Other than that, I didn't find any other redeeming qualities.There are better spy or superhero movies as a matter of fact that do better do than this but if you are Marvel Buff then sure see this one but chances are you will be disappointed as well3/10."
1424,5,Disappointed No substance. A movie just for the sake of a movie. It's like Scarjo forgot to act or something. Maybe she works only when she's with Avengers. The movie and the plot could have been better.
1425,5,"Boring and uneventful A lot of people keep saying this movie is really great because of the Marvel Universe but it is not very good at all. Yes they ruined Taskmaster, people saying that he wasn't as important are a joke. It is true that black widows character is the sidekick in this movie and that your Yelena is the main character.The the writing in this movie is very harmful, they try to throw in a little funny comedic Parts but it falls flat. So far this is the worst MC movie the date. Glad I did not waste my money.This movie is just a filler and nothing more."
1426,5,"Fast and Furious This movie is literally a fast and furious movie. Human characters doing things they shouldn't be capable of all with a dumb emphasis on family. Possibly the worst Marvel movie villain in years. Taskmaster had one line and had a massively changed backstory to the detriment to the character. Taskmaster was so awful I can't even put it into words. Furthermore, Drakov was boring and not threatening at all. Red Guardian and Yelena Belova were great additions however. In the end, this is a bland marvel movie that ruins some great characters while ripping off fast and furious, but it also introduces some great characters who I hope to see more of. Seriously though, if you are going to see this movie for taskmaster, don't bother. The only moves Taskmaster copies are in the trailer."
1427,7,"Great Action movie Marvel give us a cool, fun movie with a great storyline.There is a line that continue to the all movie.The acting is amazing, the cast is brilliant.I watched the movie at home with a great sound system, I think it's also a fun movie for the theaters."
1428,7,"Should be called ""Black Widow's Sister"" because she is more interesting Overal the movie is pretty enjoyable. The fight scenes were pretty good. Florence Pugh's character totally outshined black widow though. The movie is overall pretty good until the last 30 minutes were it became pretty cringey. They should also replace the guy who CGIed the fire and the red spray. It's pretty atrocious ngl."
1429,8,"We can only hope Yelena got her vest back after Endgame Admittedly, I was one of those that questioned the need for a standalone Black Widow movie but that's why I'm just a viewer and Kevin Feige is the boss. Logic dictates that after missing the boat when Wonder Woman came out, Captain Marvel's decent output and traditionally super-powered male leads getting their own spin-offs, it's hard to picture where a ""basic"" character like Black Window will fit in. She doesn't have a shield, a suit, a hammer nor magic to keep us entertained with for at least 120 minutes. But we have been bombarded with all these enhanced beings left and right that maybe we needed someone to ground us back again. And Black Widow fits the bill.We get a super spy action movie at a time when James Bond or Ethan Hunt have been awol for a while now. In a review for Hobbs and Shaw I floated the idea of a dysfunctional family of spies and we get that here. We get Florence Pugh (we love her in Midsommar) who was a big help in carrying the movie, David Harbour (we love him in Stranger Things,) Rachel Weisz (we love her in the Mummy films) and Scarlett Johansson finally gets the spotlight she deserve (if only to pay her back for having to endure all the sexist questions she had to maneuver her way out of for suiting up as Black Widow for the past decade.)While obviously not the strongest MCU installment in the 24 movies released so far, the fact that Black Widow was even made (Johansson also serves as an executive producer,) released, in the middle of a pandemic at that, earn some money and bring up talks of a future installment (Pugh to take over unless they do a prequel) is too much of a win for a movie that so many people (me included) doubted in the first place. Black Widow can now rest in peace knowing she wiped clean all the red in her ledger, and then some."
1430,10,"Good Story and Speed Screenplay #BlackWidow Natasha seems like supporting character in the previous marvel movies. I was really amazed by seeing the Standalone movie using this character. I thought it was a kind of drama, but it was like watching Captain America Franchise. Very interesting women centric action film. VFX and Artwork Top-class. Stunning Stunts. Claps for small twists and turns. It made even more engaging. Good Story and Speed Screenplay. Claps for artists performance. Emotionally connected in some portions. Totally entertaining like previous MCU Movies. Another good treat for Marvel Fans."
1431,9,A slight break from the typical marvel movies Closer to the Bourne movies with a touch of Marvel.
1432,5,"Mediocre Well it is difficult to make every avenger independent character movie a hit. I liked the case, the story not that much, CGI etc not up to the avengers level, but like stated in many previous reviews, can't be too choosy especially where there are no new movies to watch.If you have seen all the Avengers movie, than it's a must and you have not much choice to make.It's not that boring, just a little, when you compared to the others."
1433,6,"Black Widow 6/10 - maybe I'm just growing tired of these superhero movies that are struggling to keep it fresh, but I found this one kind of boring and most of all, underwhelming (especially for those of us who have anxiously awaited Black Widow's time in the spotlight)"
1434,5,"Disappointed, Below Average and Boring Movie This is the most boring movie after that Captain Marvel.Movie starts after Civil war incident which makes you feel excited...Then the story starts...There is no Tony or Steve...Just tells you Steve is on the run...I mean wtf Steve is a very close friend of Natasha and he is not with her. But i can understand it's a tribute movie for Natasha so maybe other characters will out shine her.. But the main Disappointment was the Villain Taskmaster...MCU literally converted most the male villains in female ...I mean this is not the right way to show Feminism..And they made one of the best villian Taskmaster a 'Girl which can be controlled by a chip' and named it Taskmaster protocol. In comics Taskmaster has a Ability to copy anyone's fighting skills but in movie they made him trash...They didn't even showed him fighting that much...This movie should be named as ""Black widow:And her family problems"".. Disappointed."
1435,7,"ACTION PACKED You won't regret spending few bucks for this movie.Quite enjoyable ACTION + Story enough to keep you engaged, yeah what else would you expect.I enjoyed it 7/10 ..."
1436,7,"Underwhelming But Still A Solid Action Flick ""Pain and suffering is every day and we are both still a trained killer. Except I'm not the one that's on the cover of a magazine. I'm not the killer little girls call their hero.""Finally, it has come. The MCU's newest addition Black Widow has Natasha Romanoff confronting the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger. This isn't necessarily an origin story or prequel. It's an interquel right after the events of Civil War and before Infinity War. Why Marvel decided for this to be the movie for phase 4? The world will never know. It's a mistake that I will hold for the rest of their days. This isn't by any means a bad movie, I'm just disappointed that it took so long to get a Black Widow movie, and now that everything has built up to it, we got this final product. Black Widow is good, but not great. And part of the issue was waiting too long. The writers on this one weren't all experienced Marvel writers except for one who did Thor: Ragnarok and helped with continuity with a few more. This branched away from the classic fantasy element we're used to, but managed to fall back into place of predictability. Most of the story is how you'd expect it to play out, especially in the ladder half. All of the family aspect is strong. There's a sense of character and place when all of them are together. As usual, the acting is great. For it being a Black Widow movie, though, Florence Pugh steals the whole thing. She's one, if not, my favorite recent actress to make a mark, so some might think I'm bias. But Yelena is such a great character and she makes the most out of it. Almost all of the character development went to her since we've already got a good portrait from Natasha at this point. David Harbour is also eccentric and funny as Alexei. Those two have some of the funniest scenes.Marvel has gotten better with comedic timing and jokes, mainly after Guardians. All of them land here. Even though the story may not be the most compelling of the universe, there's that classic charm to it that makes it a solid action flick. The action scenes don't disappoint and are full of fight scenes out of a spy movie. The VFX may not be the best, and that might be because they have bigger projects coming up, but it does the job. Many aspects of this are good, but just not quite up to par, and I don't mean to complain or anything. Had some changes been made, this could've been great. I guess my main problem comes from some of the writing, throw-awayable villains, and third act. The third act, once again, took an easy route. Once we get to where we need, everything was simplified into something we've seen before. When it comes to the villains, the main one is an evil man which obviously doesn't do a whole lot. Taskmaster could've been a good one with a little more development, but there wasn't enough time with them. The conclusion is just another fun action movie and nothing more. (Side note: I hated the title sequence for this and I don't think I'm the only one). Marvel has been on a roll with the past few additions, and maybe my expectations were too high. The family aspect and delving into family history works well in its favor. Maybe with more thought in the story, this wouldn't be underwhelming. Let me reiterate, I did enjoy Black Widow. It's easier to pick out problems with where my expectations were at. Right now it sits in the middle of my MCU additions ranked. If you liked it, good for you. If you didn't, I can completely understand. More than two watched might be needed for this one, but I'll enjoy it for now."
1437,2,"Ironically supporting actress sees more action and camera time than black widow lol What on God's green earth did I just watch. How can this be a 7 rated movie? Imdb is becoming less and less reliable every year. This movie deserves 3 starts at best.Poor story, poor execution, and the main character saw less action than the supporting character. Black widow acted more as a sidekick.Action = Nope, i think even comedy movies have more action than this."
1438,6,Good Friday Night Escape Well produced. Didn't fall into the recent releases that looked rushed to complete because of Covid. Storyline was great but the build up (lack there of) was non-existent on the villain. Not enough friction throughout the movie. Loved the family aspect. Enjoy!
1439,6,"Entertaining but somewhat generic Black widow has one of the coolest backstories. She also has one of the coolest fight styles out of all the Avengers. She had no superhuman abilities but still manages to hold her own battling genetic enhanced or supernatural villains. She has always had the best fight sequences, except for in her own movie! BW came across inferior in this movie when battling other widows, including her sister. I also wish they would have used this movie to give us a more in depth backstory instead of a recycled marvel movie. Would have loved if they showed more of her experience in the red room and her path to redemption. I would have also liked to see how she got involved with SHIELD and became so close with Hawkeye. Instead, we got a generic storyline that basically didn't contribute much to BW's legacy. Watched an interview with Scarlett stating that this movie has done things that other movies have never done before. I felt like it was like every other marvel movie. Entertaining but a missed opportunity for greatness."
1440,7,Above average Performances of Scarlet Johansson and Florence Pugh is just amazing. The story has fillers and some unnecessary scenes which try to carry emotions but fails.The 3 Disney + shows released Prior to this move set the bar so high that this movie fails to reach audiences' expectations.Looking forward to what Florence Pugh(Yelena) bring to MCU.
1441,8,"A Short & Sweet Review A short and sweet review; While Black Widow may have received some backlash from die-hard Marvel Cinematic Universe fans for being too ""woke,"" there's no doubt in my mind that most formed an opinion too early by reacting to the narrative various mainstream media journalists inaccurately created to gain more views.Does the movie focus a good percentage of its time highlighting female empowerment and showing us girls who kick major ass? Sure! But, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that when it's done with such elegance and supported by great storytelling & acting. Don't get me wrong; I can't argue that there aren't movies out there that seem to try and push social agendas while failing to apply the same care in the script itself, but that's certainly not the case with Black Widow.Opinions are like buttholes, and everyone's got one, but I'm hoping this short review might persuade you to give the film chance. Ignore the haters and unfair criticisms and go enjoy yourself at the cinema again for a positive change of space. Just be warned that this one's a little more on the dark and serious side, so don't expect it to be as kid-friendly as lighter MCU titles like Guardians of the Galaxy or Spider-Man: Homecoming.In summary, Black Widow has a stellar cast, top-notch fight scenes, beautiful special fx and plenty of action with just enough comedic relief to create the perfect recipe for fun. Sure, the movie would have offered a bigger punch if it was released before End Game, but this well-loved character unquestionably deserved her own movie, and Scarlet Johansson delivers the goods!"
1442,9,Finally Black Widow's Movie I think some people were confused about the timing of this movie...because of her fate during Endgame. It would have been nice for them to release during when it was happening in the actual timeline... or a solo movie before!But this is what we have and it is a great movie!! Loved the mix of backstory and modern happenings. It was a good well rounded movie with a good plot that ties back to the beginning. Good characters that you care about and the action makes Black Widow more well rounded. I wonder if we will see her again.
1443,9,"Best movie to pick for going back to the theatres If you haven't been back to the movie theaters yet, this is the one to see. Filled with action, this is a fast-paced ride like I haven't seen in a while. I'm shocked at all the poor reviews. But, pay close attention, they are all from reviewers who didn't like how the taskmaster was portrayed, and people who had a political agenda to target this movie and all others that have characters that don't look like them, or live their life like them. I don't understand why this movie was targeted so heavily. It's a movie about a female superhero, and some complain about feminism? Are you serious? I also totally disagree that Scarlett Johansen plays a supporting role like others have said. Johansen rocks the lead in this movie. Great story, great acting and great action. One of the best marvel movies I have seen. Black Widow is back and better than ever. Go watch it. You won't be disappointed."
1444,10,"Welcome Back to the Theaters Saw Black Widow today! It's really good! Action sequences were awesome, Performances were awesome particularly praise for Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh for their awesome performance! Would recommend you guys to see Black Widow! 🙂"
1445,10,So good This action is so good for me.oh I need it How can I download this action.
1446,6,"Decent Attempt at an Origin Story Good action sequences? Check. Badass female characters (including a strong performance by Pugh)? Check. Humorous one-liners? Check. Compelling origin story? Almost a check.The film seems to be in a bit of an identity crisis where it can't quite make up its mind if it wants to be easy, fun superhero entertainment (think Deadpool) or a grim, darker biopic about a superhero (think Logan). To its demise, it seems like the film decided to fall somewhere in the middle. So whether you go in wanting pure fantastical fun or go in wanting authentic and moving storytelling, you're left with this feeling of ""man that was almost really good.""You almost cry, you almost laugh out loud, and you almost really like the movie. For what it's worth, it also feels like a missed opportunity to create something unique. Black Widow's origin story feels like a mix between the movies Salt and Red Sparrow."
1447,10,"Loved it Right from the beginning it had me. Easy to understand great action. I love Scarlet, she is my fav. Great fun and I enjoyed every bit of this movie."
1448,1,Was Scarlett Johansson in this movie? Why do people think she can act? Her best ever performance was in Her where She played an iPad and that showed more acting skills than she did in this movie. She walks around glassy eyed and always talks the same no matter what the emotion is.Apart from that the rest of the cast did a great job but the movie is called Black Widow not about look at all the people who care about me.
1449,5,"One of the worst marvel I thought Captain Marvel would be the last worst marvel would do but they prove me wrong with that last Black Widow.Nothing like we expected, the kinda of action we know black widow for is absent, a really bad character development they literally wasted every single one of the new characters in that movie....The screenplay and Storyline are obviously the worst, so simple, basic nothing really entertaining same old stuff we see every single time. First Marvel movie I was impatient for it to end. I just don't get how Disney is making around 60M with Disney+ and 150M in theater with that disappointment of a movie.I would recommend only for educational purpose just to know what happened but it wont affect in any way your understanding of Marvel Storyline since the movie is after Civil war events and black widow died in End game so if you don't want to watch it it's really fine I deeply regret those 2h of my life ..... I mean since End game I don't get what Marvel is trying to do with WandaVision, Captain America and the winter soldier or Loki I really don't get it except making money cause the effort put on those stories are really poor it's nothing like everything before End game(except captain marvel that was hard to watch) I really hope they'll stop thinking about money they already have and focus on what kind of story they're giving out there."
1450,10,"Amazing movie! I'm sorry to hear sol these bad reviews. That is disappointing to read. My boyfriend and I loved it. It had awesome action, a great backstory to understand how black widow and yelena came to be. I was such a sad story to see how they grew up and their whole childhood they knew before the separation as a lie. Melena and Alexis weren't really their parents and yelena was her sister. To be programmed and brainwashed to be hired killers from birth was tragic. I loved how they came back together even with the tension. Alexi definitely had some great comic relief. Funny seeing him in this from being the sheriff in stranger things. I loved the movie. I find it interesting with the twist in the end about hawkeye and how that is going to play out. He wasn't responsible for black widows death, it was her choice to sacrifice her life for his. Granted it's sad because she did have a family when she did sacrifice herself. Can't wait for the dvd! Ignore the bad reviews. I thought it was amazing. And no you don't see any stunt double faces. Where did they get that from? Crazy people."
1451,7,"Great movie, but stop forcing people to do fake accents! I think it was a great movie, which has all the elements that you would expect from a typical movie, and more. Specifically: great storyline: took time to set the scene & on character development; clear & easy to follow -- good pacing (for the most part) -- great action scenes & I'm in awe of the stunt team! -- casting on point: all the cast fit the roles well; notably I loved the fact the cast was heavily female & they also did well on the diversity front -- beautiful filming locations & cinematography.*Minor critiques* I would have given a higher rating if not for the following reasons: Storyline: at the end I kinda felt unfulfilled & I can't put my finger on why. Perhaps they could have done more to make us despise the villian (him sitting in his office pressing a button, doesn't feel that ruthless for a marvel villain); which would have perhaps made the ending more satisfying. -- Pacing: there were some scenes that I think could have gone more quickly, such as the segment with everyone at the mum's house. -- Casting: happy with this generally, although I found the forced accents really distracting; and I think it would have been better to either cast people who actually have that accent, or find a reason for the character to have their own accent. -- Cringy script: I could sense the pauses in the script for when we were meant to laugh. But it's not a big deal :')Overall, I really enjoyed it. I would suggest to watch it if you don't mind a slower paced movie & you're a marvel fan."
1452,3,"Taskmaster Could Have Been Such A Great Villain This whole movie was cheesy as heck. The concept overall was decent, but the execution was completely off. I sure hope Marvel does not let this director do anything else. They will regret it deeply."
1453,6,"Too little, too late unfortunately. This movie should have come out in sequence (after civil war) to keep the tension. This prequel really loses almost all of it's potential excitement and build up on the fact you know broadly how it ends up front. The story, script and most of all the directing is off.... Everything just falls short and it ends up being a sort of half assed movie.It is unclear until about half way through that her 'family' were all independent spies, yet the motivations of everyone is that it is well known fact. But the sister then laments it as being a shock?There is little explanation on how Russia made a super soldier too and now after falcon and winter soldier apparently they are a dime a dozen?Movie didn't close out the Budapest story fully or explain how Natasha met Clint etc - which we all wanted.Acting is top notch but there just isn't enough in this film to do them justice. It's almost like watching a movie marvel didn't really want to make and they just made it to say 'hey we're not sexist'... shame because this could hve spawned a whole narrative about spies that doesn't exist in the universe really.Sorry Scarlett... you waited 13 years for this?:("
1454,6,"Good but not great... with a pleasant surprise So, I was kind of excited for Black Widow as it seemed like it might be revisit to the old MCU. And, I like Scarlett Johansen as an actress. While Black Widow is by no means my favorite character, I was looking forward to a well produced MCU movie (vs the TV series nonsense).It's a good thing Black Widow isn't my favorite character because this movie wasn't really about her. This movie seemed to be all about her sister who is played by. Florence Pugh and WOW does she do an awesome job at the role. Scarlett Johansen does a good job but whoever was writing the movie seemed to forget about the title being named after her. It seems as-if they are pushing to introduce Pugh as a new superhero and forgot about Black Widow in the making.So, if you tuned in for a Black Widow movie, you'll be disappointed because this really isn't it. You don't really discover anything about Black Widow then you really knew before. For that reason this one kind of confused me and resulted in a lower rating. Had the title been 'Yelena' it would probably rank up another star. David Harbor's character was pointless and a waste of dialogue. But, he got to play the Communist he's always wanted to be!Aside from the above, it was a decently produced movie. Directing was good. Acting was good. Story writing was MEH. First half of the movie is great! Second half feels like it was written by someone else and drags on then goes into easy explanations. All in all, a good movie that could have been great with a better conclusion and someone deciding who the movie was really about and sticking to it."
1455,1,"The name is Gaze! Male Gaze! Remember how Scarlett Johansson said her character wasn't treated like a piece of meat? Well, she must have talked about a different movie, because few comic book movies are as male-gazey as this one is. Even in ""Iron Man 2,"" where Tony Stark spoke about Natasha as if she was a toy he could buy, the way her body was shown by directors and cinematographers was much more respectful. Here, in ""Black Widow,"" most of Scarlett Johansson's scenes contain at least one prolonged, gratuitous shot centered on her backside or her breasts. Even the first shot with her in the first trailer is done this way. I really don't like this, and I honestly think it goes against any progressive ideas in the movie. If you wanted to make a movie about a bunch of women being freed from an oppressive tyrant, why would you objectify your leading actress so blatantly? Was Charlize Theron's Atomic Blonde treated like this? No, she wasn't. The makers of ""Black Widow"" have stolen plenty of ideas from ""Atomic Blonde"" (more on that - later). Why didn't they steal the idea that the leading lady can be treated like a great fighter and not like eye candy for teenage boys? I'm surprised that so few people have paid attention to this problem - and yes, it is a problem.Apart from this, the movie is just horrible. I'm sorry for saying it like this, but this is the truth. I stopped being an MCU fan a long time ago and the only reason I watched this movie was because the trailer promised more visceral action and a more personal story. It fails on both accounts.The action scenes are obviously heavily influenced by ""Atomic Blonde."" ""Atomic Blonde"" happens to be one of my favorite recent action movies, so I'm happy that it influences much bigger movies, but the imitation just doesn't work. First, Scarlett Johansson actually is not a good action performer. The use of a stunt double in this movie is way too obvious, whereas Charlize Theron did most of her stunts by herself - which made her character believable. Second, Natasha intentionally broke her own nose and then continued beating the snot out of the bad guy as if nothing had happened to her, whereas Lorraine Broughton felt every single punch she took, and that affected the way she fought. Lorraine bled, got tired, got dizzy... She was a human being, and Charlize Theron's performance reflected that. Natasha Romanoff was like a robot who never felt pain, never got tired, never bled... I can't even blame Scarlett Johansson for this - that was how the character was written.Which leads me to the other huge problem - the writing. It has every problem you can think of. It's inconsistent. In the beginning David Harbour's Alexey (the only somewhat good performance in this thing, by the way) was shown as an incredible fighter - USSR's response to Captain America, a biologically modified super soldier who is strong enough to lift and throw a truck. Later he was shown snapping the Dutch Giant's arm like a twig just for the fun of it. After he was established like that you'd expect to see him maul bad guys in a fight scene, right? Well, that's not what you get. Instead, you see him take a beating in every single action scene after he escapes from prison. He has superhuman strength and extensive training in fighting, and yet he is constantly outperformed by people who are supposed to be normal, although well trained.Rachel Weisz's Melina is even worse. Weisz is an incredible actress, but even she couldn't save such a horribly written character. I'm sorry, but Melina tortures animals just to make a point. Literally. Who thought it would be a good idea to show a scene like this and then make her one of the good guys? And why did Natasha and Yelena treat her with much more respect than they treated Alexey with? Did the writers forget the story they'd written? You know, the story where Melina spent literal decades helping the main bad guy enslave women by her own free will, while Alexey was thrown in prison by the same bad guy? Do I actually need to explain why this bothers me?Natasha and Yelena take the cake, though - mostly because they're completely devoid of personality, and I'm sick and tired of MCU characters who don't have to live with the consequences of their actions. You know, either they conveniently die, or something cancels their actions out. In the middle of the movie we find out that Natasha has killed a child for nothing. An irredeemable sin, right? No. Plot twist - the child is alive and stronger than ever, she just needs to be saved by Natasha from her abusive father. Ugh. Just ugh. Everything is so convenient in this franchise.And. To top it all, this is yet another MCU movie that ends with an explosion in the sky. How many times are they going to make the same thing, before viewers finally get tired of it?All in all, this movie is a disappointment. It doesn't keep its promises. It treats its characters like pieces of meat. It's badly written. Even the action scenes can't save it. Do yourself a favor and watch ""Atomic Blonde"" now."
1456,5,"THE END DRAMA WAS A COMPLETE TURN OFF The storyline was good. But at the end, I feel it was forced. They made the protagonists too smart for the villain that the villain became so insignificant. I even wondered why he was feared to begin with."
1457,1,Don't waste your time This movie was horrible. I made it about half way through the movie and just turned it off..
1458,5,"Bang average Spent most of this film bored silly. The action is sub-par, the CGI is poor, but the biggest disappointment is the title character. I felt some of the other Marvel films did her more justice. Also, casting Ray Winston as a russian baddie was a terrible choice, so many better options that they could have gone for. The few good things in the film were Florence Pugh and David Harbour, they, at least, added a bit of humour to an otherwise boring film."
1459,3,Very disappointing and boring The beginning had ppossibilities then it just fell flat. Black Widow was a side kick and it just seemed that she didn't need to be in the movie The action was so forced and the CGI was dreadful. A complete waste of time.
1460,2,"Just... bad. Non-action. Non-smart. Just... generic 'girls-power' flick with horrid acting (aside from few cases), common in 2021, but it's not cinema. Don't waste your time."
1461,10,"Great gap filler within the MCU Great to be back at the cinema watching BlackWidow film was a great gap filler within the MCU, giving us so much content. Lots of action. Lots of love for Natasha."
1462,1,Uhm... Taskmaster is not a girl. Stop gender swapping already established characters.
1463,9,"An MCU tutorial on family demons The backstory of Black Widow and her dysfunctional ""created"" family will give you some insight into why she is one of Marvel's most adaptive and toughest superheroes.The secret star of this movie is Black Widows long lost sister Yelena who often steals some of Natasha's thunder. This movie is full of action scenes, especially the hunt with the BMW X3 through the streets of Budapest is fun to watch. This makes this movie really for the big screen. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh play well off each other. David Harbour is very loose and funny as the Red Guardian. And Ray Winstone is viscerally effective as the megalomaniacal villain Dreykov.Light, humorous and uplifting, this film touches on themes of sibling rivalry, grievances with estranged parents and female defiance in the face of gender-based exploitation. An all around substantive and likeable film. Strongly recommended to devout MCU fans and even neophytes to the franchise."
1464,1,"the worst movie i ever seen ! The worst movie i ever seen !I dont know if is anithing worst. He used the ""marvel"" label to sell tickets but i dont think has any thing to do it . I can belive it that in 2021 existe an making such movies ! Only star is for scarlet because is a good actress . In rest garbage ! Shame !!!!"
1465,1,Mediocre at best This movie is a mere shadow compared to other movies in the marvel universe.* The story is weak - you're never led to care for anyone or anything that happens. Everything new we learn about Black Widow can basically be gleaned from the trailer or synopsis.* The CGI is really rough.* Acting is average.Not worth your time.
1466,4,"Predictable Same old Marvel script - shoot some people, run around a bit, never die from life threatening injuries, etc etc. Can't believe I actually fell for the PR hype."
1467,7,"Good but not the best Enjoyed the movie over all had some things going for it. Casting was solid and so was the acting. Someone notable was Florence Pugh as Yelena one of my favourite performances in the MCU. As most MCU movies go the action was great which is something you'd expect from Marvel nowadays. However changing taskmasters origins and doing a needless gender swap is pointless also making ""her"" a mindless drone was annoying. Story overall was mediocre but it's entertaining.Casting 9/10 Action 8/10 Story 6/10 Acting 8/10 Overall 7/10."
1468,3,"Black Widow Review Before I get any hate for this rating, just know that I still really enjoy the MCU even if every so often, one of their films/shows falls flat for me. There is a lot of fun to be had here. This is the only Marvel film that had some good jokes and made me chuckle which is incredibly rare for a Marvel film. Florence Pugh and David Harbour bring a lot of great comedic timing to their performances that definitely elevates them from boring sidekicks. Their characters are actually interesting and feel much more involved in the story. I hope we get to see those two in the future again. Although their Russian accents do need a little bit of work. Scarlett Johansson is good. Her performance is fine. She doesn't do a bad job but there is a lot to be desired especially considering this is her final appearance in the MCU (film wise not timeline wise). Rachel Weisz was fine as well but her character felt very forgettable and bland which sucks because she just falls into the background whenever other characters show up on screen. The main villain is absolutely awful. It's honestly a contender for worst MCU villain. His motivations are almost nonexistent and he exists only to yell and exposit. The characters build up that he'll be hard to kill but he just kinda dies without the influence of the characters which really defeats the purpose of them mentioning how hard he is to kill. Taskmaster is an interesting side villain but ultimately contributes nothing to the plot except as closure for Black Widow's forgettable side mission. The action scenes are kinda bland. If this was an earlier MCU film it would feel a lot better but because the MCU has bumped out some great action scenes, this just feels flat and boring. The visual effects are really spotty. Sometimes they look good and sometimes they look really really bad but the visual effects are usually pretty good. The story is very forgettable. It revolves around Black Widow taking down the Red Room again but the sequence of events is so bland and forgettable. I can't remember some sequence of events relating to the story. It was nice to hear a little bit more about the Budapest adventure but it makes me wish we had got that movie instead of this. I placed this above Ant-Man but below Captain America 1 in my MCU Ranking. If you like the MCU then you'll probably enjoy this but if you aren't super invested in this universe then you can skip this."
1469,7,"Amazing Florence Pugh was amazing in this movie.Another good section, was the perfect story. It hade a good and reasonable story line. I loved it 💓"
1470,9,Review I liked it how ever it did come off as just a nether avengers movie instead of a stand alone movie.
1471,9,"No Spoliers This was a very TERRIFIC,FUN, Action packed film. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pough did amazing playing the parts and you where very hooked on the characters. All the actors did amazing not just the main actors as well. It explains what happens in buda pest. It's explains how she turned out to be herself. It takes place around when Captain America civil war happens. Then towards the end continues on for Infinity War. I recommend going to see this film you will be HOOKED on it!!! P.s stay for the end credit."
1472,3,"A total disaster. The story was too simplistic, it is inappropriate for children because of that one scene, and it just isn't that engaging. The plot leaves many gaps to fill. Not very well done."
1473,10,"Among the top Marvel movies Johansson and Pugh knock this movie completely out of the park. Their action is gripping, their grief and trauma are convincing & heart-wrenching, and their chemistry is outstanding - the best 'buddy' duo in the MCU, I'd say (outshining Falcon & the Winter Soldier, who I like, et.al.) An added plus is that they are both gorgeous.The story is well-written. Natasha has a chance to settle scores and quiet demons from her past, as well as reunite with those she thought she'd lost. Underneath it all is a sobering fictional example of the all-too-real international problem of human trafficking.If you love Marvel movies, you'll have a blast watching this one (unless, of course, you are a misogynist like some reviewers I've read on this site.)"
1474,9,"Top 5 It may have took 10+ years to get a standalone film for the first female hero from the MCU to get her own film, it was well worth the wait. I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was, it was dark, funny, and sad. A good but sad way to end Natasha's storyline and a good way to start Yelena's. Definitely worth a watch."
1475,1,"Pity Widow Why 2? It's kind of Pirates of the Caribbean: nice, fun, Disney movie... but not a serious story about a professional killer. Sometimes boring as the plot is irrelevant, not related to what one's mind could've imagined to be a hard, dark, breathtaking life of the 'mother of dragons'... sorry 'mother of spies'. Absurd to think Nat's life was so numb.Not a Marvel movie, not the Spy movie, not even an Avenger movie."
1476,1,"This movie is just plain ideologic panflet A laughable vilain with pheromones, an dumb russian version of Steve Rogers and a transsex taskmaster.I am quite surprised of not seeing a man playing Yelena Belova role... Marvel just lost the hand on this."
1477,6,"It was OK--nothing more Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson) must deal with a villain from her past and her long-absent family.LOUD, confusing and far too long. It starts off OK but quickly falls apart and becomes confusing and convoluted. The film is also way too long--it doesn't need to run over 2 hours. There's also tons of CGI at the end--way too much. The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie."
1478,4,"Very disappointed Not enough action, the hole concept of so many widdows and a station in the sky. I was just sleeping for this movie. This should of been a kick A type movie."
1479,5,"Might be enjoyable for some but for me its a really bad movie It started off pretty good, pretty strong but towards the end things really started to get pretty over the top and hard to believe. Could have been a lot better movie if the creative choices were a bit lese ambitious."
1480,8,"Quite funny, and makes action take backseat to dialog It's a down-to-earth Marvel story: no weird space stuff or quantum realms. Just four Russians walking a fine line between teamwork and self preservation.It's an introspective look on Natasha's life and self-identity. The best parts of the movie are the quiet scenes of dialog - sometimes tense, sometimes funny, sometimes heavy. Don't worry: there are plenty of thrilling set-pieces too!Being a Disney movie, it doesn't get too deep into real-world politics but does take time to examine the tragedy of human trafficking of young girls. Shortland goes further than all other Marvel directors on having her film reflect the horrors of our real world.But perhaps the best part of the movie is the humor. It's hilarious! David Harbour and Florence Peugh steal the movie and make it one of the top 3 funny Marvel movies."
1481,9,Best Marvel Movie!!! Not your average male driven boring all muscle no wits film.Smooth scene transition and well written story line all the way till the ending.Cool fighting scenes with funny original improv lines from the cast.Scarlett and Rachel was very natural and Florence was very offbeat in a good way.Worth the watch!!
1482,2,Meh The movie was way too long. We fast forward through the beginning of her childhood. The acting was boring and soulless. Was this a comedy or what?
1483,7,"Expected more Not bad, expected a bit more. We've been waiting for a Black Widow solo movie for 10+ years and this is all we get? Florence Pugh carried this whole movie. Cant wait to see more of her in the MCU. Not that the other cast members didn't do an amazing job. David Harbour, Rachel Weisz, and of course Scar Jo. All absolutely amazingI don't think this movie gave the Scarlett Johansson or Black Widow the solo recognition she deserves.Overall this movie wasn't bad, but just a bit disappointing."
1484,5,"Disappointed I think it was okay, but I was disappointed in the movie. The best thing in the movie was the sister. I don't think I'll be seeing it again."
1485,9,underestimated Underestimated Underestimated Underestimated Underestimated Underestimated.
1486,6,"Weakest Marvel movie in recent times I'm an avid marvel fan. I watched both infinity war and endgame thrice in theatres and have watched all Marvel movies countless times. So I was very excited to watch a Marvel movie after 2 years. But boy, it was disappointing. The plot was wafer thin with shallow characters and Limitless shaky camera action scenes. The saving grace of the movie are Scarlett and Florence Pugh. If you're a Marvel fan like me, it's going to be like watching a phase 1 movie. For others, you can pass it. It doesn't change anything in MCU."
1487,3,"Not bad but not good either I am a big MCU fan and have been ever since I purchased my first Silver Surfer comic in my teens. Out of all the movies the in the MCU my favorite was the Guardians of the Galaxy.I went into this movie with very high expectations especially after Infinity Endgame.The plot seems intriguing however it was not executed well enough for such a big budget movie like this.The CGI was just ok nothing to seriously write home about.The acting seemed forced the comedy was not funny at all, the fake Russian accents just made it worse.Other MCU movies I have re-watched more than three times, this movie I am not going to re-watch."
1488,7,Has a lot of promise - but also a lot of issues The opening for this film is one of the best I've seen in years.The young actresses playing Yelena & Natasha are fantastic.From here despite being called Black Widow it feels like it is Yelena's Black Widow movie. It doesn't feel like Natasha's swan song. Finally finding out the full story of what happened in Budapest does bring closure to something that has been spoken about in so many films.Florence Pugh & David Harbour are on point in every scene. And I do hope they are around for several projects.
1489,1,"Enjoyable until.... Dear marvel.... What do you get when you put bree to play captain marvel,leave hulk out of endgame and make tuskmaster a woman?..... you get what you deserve..."
1490,3,"No Stakes My titles says it all. I sat there watching this movie for FREE and honestly felt it to be a waste of time. When you have seen the character in the present and then make a movie about their past then you had best come up with something other than providing an explanation as to how they came into possession of a piece of clothing. Florence Pugh did steal the movie from Scarlett. But for the most part I sat there bored, knowing that 'Natasha' would not die, 'Yelena' would survive. Taskmaster (one of the best Marvel villains EVER) would be ruined and that 'wokeness' would make a bad movie even worse. The family dinner scene which some thought was 'cringe' I actually thought was the best part of the movie. Marvel phase 4 gets a hard pass from me beginning with Black Widow (which should have come before Avengers Infinity War."
1491,5,"Lackluster Opener to Phase Four After nearly two years since the last MCU movie, we are presented with ""Black Widow"", the first feature-length entry to kickstart Phase Four. I was pretty much looking forward to the movie, perhaps because I had incorrectly assumed it to be the origin story of Black Widow, and it seemed to be an interesting premise, since we only ever get hints of where she came from in the previous entries. The result is a bland movie, a disappointing movie with a plot that has zero stakes, random characters, and ultimately just feels like a set-up, instead of a full-fledged story.The first problem I have is the plot. It's set between ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"". We know what happens to Natasha Romanoff during these two movies, and I don't recall Romanoff mentioning the events that happened in this movie in ""Infinity War"". This essentially makes the plot of ""Black Widow"" feel like what you may call as a sidequest in a video game, it's highly filler and to be honest, it doesn't even feel like Romanoff is the main character here since I don't think she experiences particularly life-changing here. The main focus seems to revolve around Florence Pugh's character Yelena Belova, who plays Romanoff's sister, sort of. In the comics, Belova also assumes the mantle of Black Widow, so given that Romanoff's character died in ""Endgame"", you can guess what the purpose of the movie is.What else drives the plot? The villain. After a string of top-tier villains such as Thanos, Hela, Mysterio, ""Black Widow""'s main antagonist represents a terrible regression. It's an amalgamation of the MCU's worst villains, reminiscent of Malekith. Bland, boring, no charisma, no presence, generic, and pretty low IQ. There's the Taskmaster, essentially a person in a suit of armor that's not even that advanced, and another villain, who's supposed to be this elusive mastermind who hides behind the curtains, but turns out to be pretty lackluster. Considering that by this time frame, Romanoff's faced and lived through the likes of Loki, Ultron, witnessed aliens and the might of superheroes like Thor, Vision, it's hard to believe that the Taskmaster will pose a threat to Romanoff.There are some side characters here. I was interested in David Harbour's character, Red Guardian, who was supposedly the Soviet counterpart of Captain America. But he turned out to be insignificant in the movie, and did not particularly stand out, which is pretty disappointing since he's supposed to be a super-soldier, yet seems incompetent throughout the whole movie. Rachel Weisz's character is also pretty generic, rounding out a roster of characters that feel uninspired, save for some flashes of charm from Florence Pugh.The action sequences were also pretty subpar. The scenes in the first half of the movie were decent, as they didn't rely too much on explosive special effects that filled the whole screen, so I got the impression that it was pursuing the style of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". However, that gradually changed and the climax was a ridiculous action sequence, which while large-scale, did not really leave an impression on me.This is a pretty disappointing entry in the MCU, considering that the last string of movies they churned out, while they may be formulaic, were solid. ""Black Widow"" stumbles pretty heavily. I could respect it more if they stumbled while trying to deviate from the formula and create something quite different, but I felt this was a pretty lazily crafted movie, that only served as set-up for perhaps the growing MCU. It doesn't really provide anything new and by the end of it, you don't get the feeling that you're able to connect more dots across the different movies in the saga; it's essentially an unnecessary plot thread. Here's to hoping that Marvel can get back in the groove with its upcoming entries."
1492,7,"Inner self of Black Widow MCU FANS : Please give me a typical Spy movies.Marvel : Summarise with 3 and half minutes of astonishing opening scene and focus into inner feeling of black widow.Basically a self redemption of black widow, her desire of families, her loneliness and her redemption. Last goodbye of Scarlet as a black widow which can't be replace..worth to watch."
1493,5,"Same old predictable Marvel mediocrity Seriously how do people still get excited about these movies? It's the same old plot with the same old repetitive style of action sequences.It's not a bad movie by any means, but not great either. It's just average. So average, in fact, that I don't remember very much of it except for a good portion of the ending. I am still just genuinely baffled at how people get so excited for these movies.... They haven't been interesting or unique since the late 2000s, early 2010s. The only reason I saw it was because someone else gave me the tickets for free; I would have been upset if I had wasted money on generic comic book movie #327."
1494,4,Sadly not great... (David Harbour is good though!) This movie was really disappointing. I wasn't going into it expecting Endgame but it still underperformed. When I first saw this film was coming I felt confused as it undermined her death in Endgame? I then thought that they must have a great story to tell if they want to make a film about Black Widow. They didn't. There is absolutely no need for this film to exist.
1495,9,Family fun I love this dysfunctional family of assassins. Real issues of trust and abandonment with plenty of action and humour.
1496,10,"Watch it on the big screen, if you can. Black Widow is a prequel focusing on Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), set after the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016) & before the events of Avengers: Infinity War(2018). Natasha faces off against the demons of her past, when a new threat emerges.Black Widow is a fantastic movie. Director Cate Shortland has given us another unforgettable film, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are eye-popping. Natasha Romanoff finally gets a worthy solo movie, that the fans have been waiting for, for several years. Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as Natasha Romanoff. Florence Pugh is spectacular as Yelena Belova. Can't wait to see more of Florence Pugh's Yelena, in future Marvel Cinematic Universe projects. Rachel Weisz is brilliant as Melina. David Harbour is phenomenal as Alexei. Johansson, Pugh, Weisz & Harbour have this effortless camaraderie in all their scenes together. Ray Winstone is superb as Dreykov. O-T Fagbenle is great as Mason. William Hurt is effective as Secretary Ross. Ever Anderson & Violet McGraw are perfect as Young Natasha & Young Yelena, respectively. The supporting cast is excellent. Black Widow is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. Can't wait for the rest of Marvel's movies & Disney+ TV shows, that are due in the next couple of years. What a time to be alive!"
1497,1,"Not interested enough to keep watching And this is nothing to do with women taken the leading part, Before you start marvel I don't wish to see the origin of Hawkeye or falcon either, yawn."
1498,4,"Boring I kept watching to the end in hopes of getting better. It doesn't. The unrealistic action scenes, the fact that Natasha should've died like ten times in the first part of the film, like for real, she survives explosion, fires, falling from buildings, the weak script, all of that is bad, but honestly the worst part is how boring this movie is."
1499,10,"Top 5 Marvel. In My Opinion. Humor to me goes a long way to making a movie interesting when lots of action is involved. David Harbour did a fantastic job in bringing the best Red Guardian I could imagine. Florence Pugh is really a remarkable talent in this role and sells the emotion perfectly, in my opinion this is a top 5 Marvel movie that I will be watching multiple times. Scarlett J in her final outing as Natasha Romanoff got the closure needed and in my opinion shuttered the book on that ledger for all times. Rachel Weisz, what can I say but a great performance and her character literally broke a leg, actor act always."
1500,8,"One of Marvel's Best ""Black Widow"" is one of the most well thought-out movies to come out of Marvel, and also one of the darkest. A great throwback to the espionage themes in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was a good choice given Natasha's spy-roots.We get the chance to see one of the biggest splotches of red in Natasha's ledger, and how she attempts to wipe it clean. The deep-dive into her past is also extremely well done, and twists and turns that occur are not at all forced. The action, especially the fight-choreography is some of the best to come out of a Marvel film. As expected, it's very ""show-y"" but very practical, brutal and extremely well acted. I could easily see some people seeing/enjoying this film strictly for the well crafted fighting.While it would be easy to make a film about an aloof spy very cold and void of emotion, ""Black Widow"" carries much heart with laments on family, and how overwhelming and shocking it can be to confront ones past. The acting is especially well at conveying this; I would argue all of the mains are worthy of awards.Overall ""Black Widow"" is a great espionage-acting film that has a lot of heart in the miss, and definitely worth the watch. My only major regret is that this wasn't released sooner."
1501,5,"A good movie to watch on a plane This is the perfect movie to watch when you're on a long flight, jet lagged, and just need something to watch that halfway entertaining but require no brain function. If you fall asleep you can wake up and still understand the basic plot of the movie. This embodies what Black Widow is.The acting's fine, the actions decent, does BW survive an ungodly amount of falls and explosions? Yes. Do you learn anything about Black widows backstory? Not really. Oh but you learn how she got her vest from Infinity War. Which is cool...I guess?The biggest problem with this movie is it came out like 5 or 6 years too late. I can't stress how average this movie is. Don't think too hard enjoy your 2 hours, and don't worry about rewatching it."
1502,10,Loved it! 🌟 I loved every second of this film. One of my favorite Marvel movies of all time!
1503,10,"Wonderful way to fire the character A fun, solid and amazing movie. A mix of engaging and absorbing themes, they present us with an espionage thriller driven by chemistry between the characters, the performances, the humor, the action moments, and the good visuals.The story of the movie is good, it has an approach that is refreshing to the MCU, allowing it a sense of style and fun that is really enjoyable, it doesn't try to tie in on other MCU projects to make it work. It's a solidly entertaining standalone adventure complete with fun family dynamics that adds additional character development amid all the action.The film touches on very strong themes that are still a problem in society, how they somehow absolve the arc of the protagonist in her greatest regret and we understand the actions of the red room and the psychological damage it did to Natasha. And other widows, something that stands out at this point is Taskmaster, and I'll explain why .... Taskmaster was a drone programmed by his father Draykob, the supervisor of the Red Room, a Soviet top-secret training and brainwashing program that she turned young women into the best undercover assassins in the world to execute orders with brutal efficiency. Based on what we saw in the film, we see him as a burden to the protagonists, as he remained undefeated throughout the film. And on that note, Taskmaster turned out to be too much for Natasha throughout the movie. It wasn't until climax that Natasha learned the truth, and then set out to save her. On a thematic level, this somehow absolves Natasha of her greatest regret, killing a girl to gain her own freedom, and gave her a chance to redeem herself, at least on some level, by freeing Antonia from her father's control and giving her a second chance at life like them and the other black widows.Without a doubt, this film marks a triumphant return of Marvel Studios to the cinema and we hope in the future we can continue to see these characters in the next projects of phase 4."
1504,6,"Pugh and Harbour were excellent!! Tremendous action throughout the show, really fun experience in IMAX. Action scenes are intense and transition well. Make the effort to see this film in theaters, it is well worth it."
1505,6,"Kinda dissapointing to me The trailer was good but the movie seems so bad at character development. I don't even remember the name of the(maybe worst)villain of Marvel Cinematic Universe ever. Howerver,the fight scenes are good enough."
1506,2,"Really bad, boring and no fun movie Receive only 2 star just for all that has been done from MCU."
1507,8,"Definitely not as bad as some as some of the reviews make it sound So this movie is not the best MCU film but it isn't as bad as many of the other reviews say.Natasha is not at her best in this movie which is sad because this is probably her last appearance in the MCU. Yelena is awesome and I am looking forward to seeing more of her in the MCU hopefully alongside John Walker and others so we can get a Thunderbolts team. Red Guardian is funny and the over the top accent and general stupidity of everything he says makes him one of the MCU's best characters yet.Taskmaster is barely in the movie and isn't as good as I expected for one of the best villains Marvel has dreamed up over the years The whole mind control thing was stupid and I kinda hope we get the real one later on down the line.The story made since for the most part but was a little predictable, it honestly would have been more surprising if Taskmaster was someone besides Dracov's daughter.I appreciate the attempt to give Natasha a memorial which she got screwed out of in Endgame but I honestly think the Avengers going through 7 stages of grief was more touching,Also I would like to point out the plot whole of how the heck did Natasha get away from Ross at the end, and if your were just going to escape on your own why did you refuse to go with your family, small army of highly trained assassins, and the mind controlled pawn that didn't really do all that much.Overall this is a good movie but it could have been a bit better. Overall, story 8/10, characters 9/10 (Taskmaster is why it isn't 10/10) plot 9/10. Awesome movieAlso I would like to add for the people who said this movie was the worst MCU movie ever you guys have obviously never seen the Incredible Hulk."
1508,10,"I loved it!!! After waiting so long for this movie it was exactly everything I wanted it to be. Yes, maybe it wasn't the superhero action movie Marvel has us used to, but I never expected it to be. This was Natasha's origin story and it was perfect in delivering exactly that."
1509,7,"An overdue Black Widow solo film that delivers more on character than spectacle; Florence Pugh steals the show! Black Widow is a grounded, quieter origin story for Natasha Romanoff which will satisfy fans of the character. It is smaller-scaled in terms of action spectacle, but fans who care about Black Widow will appreciate the character development.Black Widow fills in the missing narrative gaps for its title character between all the Avengers films. We learn about Natasha Romanoff's dark past in Russia before she joined the Avengers. In the first Avengers, Black Widow talks about having red on her ledger and that is dealt with here in a dramatically satisfying manner which retroactively deepens her story arc from Infinity War. The idealist in me wishes this origin story was told earlier and wasn't an afterthought on the Marvel timeline.Director Cate Shortland, who has a background in indie dramas, brings a more delicate touch that veers away from the usual Marvel aesthetic. The cinematography is shot in an intimate fashion that pulls up close to the actor's faces, which translates to a Bourne Identity shaky quick-cut style in the fight scenes. The musical score takes its cue from old political thrillers. Overall, the film feels more intimate and hand-made.There are fewer jokes, something which I appreciated. Black Widow is not a comedy. In fact, it's one of the more tonally serious Marvel installments. The few gags that are there do land and function more like tension breakers than comedic quips.Scarlett Johansson delivers a solid performance in her final outing. Her portrayal here feels like Johannson's own vision of the character. Natasha is not dressed or photographed in an overtly sexual way. She just is a capable Avenger solving her own problems. The Natasha in this film is much more vulnerable than we've seen before. It seems like the note Johannson wants to leave on and she accomplishes that.David Harbour as the Red Guardian, a Russian version of Captain America who is forsaken by his country, was funny as the comedy relief. His character left more to be desired.It is Florence Pugh who steals the show as Yelena Belova. She brings gravitas and communicates her character's dimensions under limited screentime, quickly establishing herself as the most compelling new Marvel character post-Infinity War. The sister story between Natasha and Yelena was well-executed. I look forward to seeing Pugh's next outing as Yelena.Like in most superhero fare, Black Widow struggles between what the film is thematically about versus the commercial expectations it has to deliver. The family drama between Johansson, Pugh, Harbour, and Weisz is easily the best part. With all the commercial box-ticking, the film is too overwhelmed to sink its teeth in exploring this broken family dynamic.At one point, William Hurt's Thaddeus Ross, who is chasing Natasha Romanoff for crimes against the Sokova Accords, feels more like a representation of the Disney-Marvel conglomerate chasing down Scarlett Johansson as she sneakily weaves an arthouse family drama beneath this superhero movie.The film could have used fewer action sequences and traded that time for more dramatic scenes of the family working out their issues. There were a few fights that seemed unmotivated and I am sure the director would undoubtedly agree.Marvel Studios has gotten the whole world to care about all these characters now. Everybody now sits so obediently waiting for the end credits scene. We've seen science, aliens, gods, and magic. Marvel has us in the seats already. They can really wow us with more feels."
1510,6,"A fun Marvel movie, but should have been far more BLACK WIDOW is a movie that should have been released back in 2014. But since Marvel took so long to develop this film, audiences finally get their Black Widow solo movie far too late, after we already know the fate of the character. Regardless, this is a perfectly entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it could have been so much more. The film is at its best when it is focused on its characters and the performances of the actors, and when it tries to be a spy thriller rather than just another big-budget MCU tentpole.The best parts of this movie all involve either Florence Pugh or David Harbour, who play the sister and father of Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow). They both give charismatic performances that supercede some of the more generic aspects of the plot. The stunt work is also quite fantastic for much of the movie, especially in the first two-thirds. A car chase scene and a sister-to-sister fight scene are both choreographed excellently and are thrilling from start to finish.For the first two acts of BLACK WIDOW, I was invested in the storyline and was thoroughly enjoying myself due to the action and the different approach on a Marvel film. However, the final act reverts back to the absolute ridiculousness that Hollywood money-makers such as this are known for, and the movie lost me at that point. Once the characters arrive to the location for the emotional climax and final major CGI fight scene, the writing becomes annoyingly trite and boring, and the action becomes overblown and mind-numbing. I even ceased to be invested in the story and character arcs, and stopped caring at all about how the movie concludes.BLACK WIDOW may be another watchable action movie from Marvel, but at this point they need to turn things up a notch and deliver something truly different. This film will not be regularly talked about in a year's time, and Disney/Marvel needs to start making more movies that stick in viewers' brains more than just another sci-fi CGI fight scene. B-"
1511,6,Better than most but a little to ambitious The movie seemed like it tried to cram three black window movies in to one. I couldn't tell if it seemed like there was too many or too little antagonists. But overall a pretty solid solo movie. It is forgivable coming off of the last 2 movies being endgame and far from home. As I said solid movie though.
1512,4,"Predictable, illogical, disappointing. Few entertaining action scenes, lots of tacky dialogue."
1513,1,A Boring Mess of a Movie What a boring piece of trash. A movie thrown together for the sake of throwing together a movie. No plot. Cardboard characters. Spoon fed CGI. Sarcasm for sarcasms sake.It's time to get off this ridiculous comic book action movie train. It's dead. Let it Rest In Peace and find some new creative filmmakers with something valuable to do.Enough is enough.
1514,9,"Great movie, great cast I waited a while for this movie and I enjoyed it. Felt the cast was great and felt it was a satisfying end to Black Widow's story."
1515,7,Should've been called Widows Acting was awesome especially from Florence Pugh she stole the show. Her character Yelena had a fun relationship with Natasha but also was the best character in the movie. David Harbour was also very good and made for a really fun character. Even tho Yelena and Red Guardian were great they took focus off of Black widow/Natasha. This is a problem because the whole point of the movie was to let Natasha finally shine but with the introduction to the new characters she ended up splitting the spotlight 3 ways.Since I know what happened in Endgame it took away from the action involving Black Widow. There wasn't a sense of urgency since I know in the end she'll be ok.Marvel has this theme of using comedy in poor places and it showed in this movie. When Red guardian started singing American pie it took away from what could have been a great character scene.TaskMaster sucked. As someone who knows a little bit about the comics and has seen taskmaster in smaller tv adaptations she was extremely disappointing. Nothing but a goon with a not so interesting background.
1516,6,Not bad But isn't good. The CGO is really bad and the story too. I'd like but expected more.
1517,6,"Missing the Main Four Guys Unfortunately, all this movie did was make me miss Rogers, Thor, Stark and Banner. The plot was boring, the action uninspired and it just seemed like a whole movie where the things you want to see are happening off screen."
1518,6,... It was the badest movie of disney im sure if they try it would be so better.
1519,4,"Meh. It had some good parts, mostly bad. Massive plot holes."
1520,7,Awesome 👌 Wow. Superb mcu movie. One last time we could see Natasha. Yelena see u again.
1521,6,"Watch Loki Instead Quality has definitely moved to TV. If you want thoughtful superhero action, watch Loki or Wandavision. This was the cinematic equivalent of The Fast and the Furious 9."
1522,10,"There is literally nothing bad I can say about this movie This movie was fun to watch, had a great sense of humor (as expected) and gave us a lot of Black Widow's background.In my opinion the origin story is not of Natasha but of Yelena. If seems as if Yelena will take Natasha's place and they made a great introductory to her character. It seems that the next Black Widow movie/introduction Yelena will lead."
1523,5,"Meh Disappointing at best. Neither an origin story nor continuation. No background as to how she became a widow assassin, nor what motivated her to join the avengers and ""do the right thing."" Florence Pugh is a delight. Title character, Scarlett Johansson, zero to work with in terms of motivation. I found it pretty confusing, and a big disappointment. David harberg's Red guardian, is silly attempt at comic relief. Basically, a mess."
1524,2,Really??? If you don't know or care about the character Taskmaster the movie gets a 5. If you are a fan of Taskmaster or Marvel comics in general don't waste your time. They turned him into a female cyborg. I averaged the two and gave the movie 2 stars.
1525,8,"Quintessential Natasha This film turned out to be bitter sweet. On the one hand, it delves deep into what makes Natasha who she is and explores her backstory, family dynamic and her relationships with people. On the other, it's a film that should have come out years earlier - since her death in Endgame means that she will no longer appear in the MCU.The plot takes a while to get going, but it does eventually find its feet - teasing with a tense opening shot and then exploring how Natasha became a super spy.Natasha is a person that is willing to go through pain and is not afraid of death - yet will not accept when her loved ones suffer. And this film gives us an idea of why she decided on her sacrifice in Endgame.She was done a raw deal in many of the Avengers films. She started out as a sexy secretary with a set of skills on the side to the token female in the group of male super heroes - to a fully nuanced hero ready to do whatever it takes to save the innocent.We will miss her.Oh and Florence Pugh is absolutely incredible this film. Hopefully we will see more of her character in the future."
1526,7,"Mid-Tier MCU Movie I love MCU, but actually I never excited to see this film for some reasons. First, even tho Black Widow has been around for like 10 years in the MCU, she still isn't one of my favorite characters. Second, because they released it after the character have died in the previous movie (Avengers: Endgame). This movie could make me more excited if they released it on the same timeline as the movie take place, 2016/2017. It just feel kinda weird that they put this as the first movie of MCU Phase 4.The film starts off very strong with establishing Natasha Romanoff's childhood and her family. And reveal how Nat ended up being a Black Widow. Actually one of the best opening from all Marvel movies in my opinion.Many people don't like how Marvel use Taskmaster in this movie. But I'm actually agree with that. My problem with the villain is that he just got small screentime and seems not threatening at all. I thought Taskmaster will be the next Winter Soldier kind of villain when I watch the trailers and then I was wrong. For the third act, yeah Marvel really have a problem with this. CGI fight scene is fine, but if they fail, it makes the whole scene and sequence look terrible.But beside all of that, this movie was doing great on telling the backstory of Nat and the way they respecting the character's death. If I'm making my version of MCU movie ranking, maybe I'll put this in number 13/14/15 out of 24 movies."
1527,6,"Tried too hard... ...with the action scenes to make Black Widow appear indestructible when she's not. She's a well trained, but ultimately still ordinary human being without super powers.Other than that, the film is entertaining, but not memorable, and rather unevenly paced.The sister, Yelena, was the better character, more enjoyable to watch, but Natasha herself was not bad either. The post-credit kind of cheapened the movie to make it seem like a promotion of the upcoming Hawkeye series and the woman with the purple hair lock seems to be a stand-in for Coulson.Good for a one time watch, not recommended for a second time."
1528,6,"Very average movie The fight sequences are often cut off or not intense, the story line is all over the place, don't add anything significant to the MCU, the trailer looks better than the actual movie. Very very average film unfortunately."
1529,8,"Pretty good I would rate this as a pretty good marvel movie, along the. Lines of iron man 3. Good action and Scarlett always carries a movie.Florence Pugh is a bit short and chubby to be taken seriously as an assassin, apart from than it's definitely worth a watch. Ignore the low scores, they are just from incels who hate women."
1530,1,"The worst. Well, this is just one of the worst movies ever. But, of course, the idiots are gonna love it and it's gonna make a billion dollars. Just like F9. Big surprise."
1531,7,"Not bad, not bad at all! I had low expectations of the film and was surprising pleased and enjoyed it the whole time! Florence is an absolute scene stealer followed closely by David. Great story, and the end credit scene is awesome!"
1532,3,"Natasha, you won't be missed... ... is what I suppose the writers and the director thought when they came up with this movie. People wondered why does such a ""strong female character"" get her movie a decade after the inception of the franchise and here's the reason - they never envisioned her as one. When she needed to shine her spandex bottom, to say a quippy line or pose for a group shot - she was appreciated and remembered... by youtube's ""best of black widow"" compilations. But when it comes to origin stories or what can a character do on their own... Well, only one thing was important: that she was russian. So the movie isn't about her as a character. No, it's about her sister and her family. And it's not about her motivations or personality, it's about an evil ruski being an evil ruski. And the problem is... that ruski is probably the best character in the whole movie. And what he does is basically what USA has done for the past 50 years. So all the ""bad man is mad"" had no effect on me. In fact, I merely appreciated the actor's performance. As well as Pugh's best rendition of JarJar Binks.The action is terrible. Editing is atrocious and unwatchable. Fighting is fake and animated. It's basically a Captain Marvel that tries and fails, because you don't win a game by scoring into your own gate. The narrative and the pacing are barebone too, because far too much time gets wasted on, to put it simply, idiotic comedy and what concerns character developed is mostly done by out of place action scenes. Or worse.But I did enjoy the Red Guardian's character. Even if he was written with the all the misandry you could think of. Not as bad as the latest Ghostbuters though. And I kind of appreciated the chemistry between characters. Again - the humor. It's not a tragedy or an action movie, more like a Futurama episode. And I think Black Widow deserved better. Yes, she is russian. Yes, he had an origin story in her comics. Should I divulge that the origin story of Black Panther characters would make modern lefties tear their hair out? Changes are often made to sell the propaganda, and it seems like the respect for the character did not outweigh the necessity of her classic origin.So, no, it's not as bad as Captain Marvel. It's not something to shoot for, like Red Sparrow. It's just a bad movie. One of the many. 200mil$ well-spent. Wonder Woman 1984 tips her hat."
1533,6,"First Marvel movie you can watch while seeing other videos on Youtube! There is a good chunk of humor in there. A good Action film with sometimes great, sometimes forced action scenes. In my opinion the movie tries so hard to mark its name that it misses on what it actually wanted to achieve.Do not ignore other reviews when they say that Florence Pugh really steals the show, overshadowing black widow. Don't believe me? Google black widow movie and she is first in case list with SJ in second :D."
1534,10,Best Marcel movie Watch it without Avengers mindset and this is one of the best movie that came out of marvel studios ...with repartee and action that would make you wanting for more 👌👌 first of. Kind action in air ...
1535,10,"4DX was amazing! Saw the movie in 4DX, and the effects definitely added to what I'm sure would've been a great experience anyway."
1536,8,"Not as bad as everyone say Different kind of marvel... Dont expect anything, and you will like it😉"
1537,4,"Unoriginal, boring and tideos The story is mind-numbingly unoriginal, the movie was boring and tideus to get through. I almost dozed off in the cinema which is surprising since the last time that happened was when I was 5 years old.I don't know what I expected and I deeply regret paying money to go see this. I don't know what it is with Marvel, they just write the same story over and over. This is the last marvel movie I ever watched on cinema.By the way, who made the special fx? Its literal garbage.That being said, the actors did a great job portraying their characters and should not be held accountable for this trainwreck of a movie."
1538,7,"Very good action movie... ""Black Widow"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch Natasha Romanoff (aka Black Widow) facing her past and trying to confront a dangerous conspiracy before it's too late. She is also forced not only to face her past but also to close some unfinished business.I enjoyed this movie because it contained many good action scenes that were combined very well with comedy. The plot was interesting and not boring while the visual effects gave a beautiful touch in the movie and lifted even more. The direction which was made by Cate Shortland was good and she did a nice job on the way she presented the story behind Natasha Romanoff. The interpretations of both Scarlett Johansson who played as Natasha Romanoff and Florence Pugh who played as Yelena Belova were very good and their combination worked very well too. Rachel Weisz who played as Melina and David Harbour who played as Alexei gave a different touch in the movie and also helped to the evolution of the main characters. To sum up, I have to say that if you are a fan of Marvel then I am definitely sure that you will love ""Black Widow"" but even if you are not this movie is a good opportunity for you to become."
1539,8,"[7.6] An orange world where characters are made of rubber Imagine a world where characters are made of extra-flexible rubber, fairly indestructible with tons of extra luck as (to) not having the ""sky"" falling onto their heads and most importantly, laws of physics bend amicably. Well, that's Black Widow with an average screenplay, very good acting, tons of incredible luck, huge VFX & choreography and eye-candies the size of five football fields.It's entertaining to watch, yet lacking needed dark vibes, while having ""goofy"", cheesy, ""funny"" plots and conversations to make you feel what? Better?! Or cringe your teeth to powder?!Shut your brain off, have a huge cinematic experience, but be sure that you'll forget it as soon as your eyes open up back to the real world.That's not Black Widow. That's a circus with somebody named Natasha Romanoff in it.I almost forgot, kudos to Rachel Weisz, David Harbour and the emotionally serious! Florence Pugh who delivered believably and enjoyably, adding much needed weigh to this production."
1540,10,"10 just for the acting performance delivered The story is also enjoyable, especially the familiy/reunion part, was really nice. I wish there was more for the red soldier, who's character was refreshing and very very attractive...who knows, maybe in a future, will have a movie like captain America and the red soldier."
1541,5,Weak That was a really weak plot that would have worked as just a 30minute short film stretched into a movie. After the trailer everyone was expecting to see an action packed movie and there was none. Taskmaster had to be the most disappointing entry in mcu universe so far. Barely had anything to do and not even had a decent fight. It also missed the humour that we usually have in Marvel movies. They tried to be funny but missed miserably. 5 is the best rating this deserves.
1542,1,"Just plain boring I absolutely love Marvel movies, however this was just dire.The plot and twists were completely predictable, made no contribution to the overall story arc and frankly was just boring. That's a first for a marvel movie. The lead actress is was overrated in terms of popularity and talent."
1543,6,"Has potential but can't use it! Believe me, this movie could have been told much more deeply and effectively. The material he has is great, but he does not know how to use it. It can't go above and beyond being an ordinary MCU movie."
1544,2,"Wait for it on Red Box or when you can see it home. It is okay, but don't spend the money right away. I would highly recommend you wait for the TV free movie."
1545,7,"Accurate as per solo movie , but fails to point out the main ""Protagonist"" A very casual film which feels like one from DC in the beginning, finds a fab way to put black widow on the big screen finally. Scarlett was fantastic in her role, and so were the other characters, Harbor was a clear sparkle in the film though ! The main and only problem is that the title doesn't matches with the actual flow of the film, it seems like it were 'Widow Sisters' or something. The main protagonist is lost somewhere in the script. Else everything is perfectly balanced.The ending looked more of a commercial-biased one, paving paths for Hawkeye, it should have ended in a more emotional way to pay her proper tribute."
1546,3,Cobblers Pap . That is all .when are we going to a good movie from Hollywood?Marvel sucks ass.
1547,10,"Y'all wanted a twist eh? COME ON PHASE 4 LET'S GET SICKENING! First off I give it about an 8.5 out of 10. I just wanted to bring the score up. Because in no way is this the worst MCU film...nor is it even the worst First Solo MCU film (a la Thor 1, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Dr. Strange, etc)I think this movie is so much fun! Scarlet Johansson finally got some material to show off her acting chops in End Game and they killed her minutes later because Hawkeye had a family? I was never a Scar Jo or Widow fanboy but the ending of End Game just didn't sit right with me so I was rooting for her ever since. And compared to movies like Infinity War, End Game, Black Panther, Ragnarok, etc of course it can't hold a candle to those movies. However for being it's own thing but being related to Marvel it 1000% worked!Scar Jo finally got to act, got some great action scenes, depth to her character, and a personality. Plus she did a great job producing!The movie itself though was perfect and wouldn't really change much about it. For one the pacing was absolutely INSANELY GOOD! There was never an unnecessary long drawn out scene. There was never any action scenes that felt like they were never ending. There was a perfect balance! Just when you were thinking hmm I could use some action or something funny or exciting to happen right now it would and just when you needed a breather from the action they gave you a well written and INCREDIBLY DELIVERED DIALOGUE SCENE that actually moved the story forward.The fight scenes were off the chain amazing for Marvel and I hope they move more in that direction to be quite honest! I want a little violence and things to look like they hurt in my super hero movies. I mean a punch from Black Panther or a shield to the face should look sort of brutal if you think about it. Anyways the non-hand to hand fighting action scenes like THAT TANK CHASE SCENE or the final SKY BATTLE(I mean a SKY BATTLE?! How bad a$$?!) were really well done as well. And sure things were over the top and wild but they needed to give Black Widow her WOW type action/final battle moment. Plus everything else was fairly grounded for the MCU and comparing the ""Sky Battle"" to almost every other MCU film's battles it isn't too crazy. You arent expecting an Oscar winning period piece drama where every little detail is exactly true to life when you're watching a Marvel movie.The dramatic scenes in this movie really made me feel exactly what they wanted and then some. And largely due to the incredible acting ability of the cast. From the intro that was just sooo soooo dark for a Disney/Marvel Studios film. Truly haunting! To the incredible scenes between Natasha and Yelena and their umm parents?...so good!The story was reallllly great! Much much more entertaining than I ever imagined to be honest. Maybe my low expectations made me love it more...but I don't think so because I've rewatched it a few times now and even after the First viewing of a Marvel film hype I still enjoy it just as much.The whole story about the chemical control and the antidote, the aspects of a complicated family that you still care about at the end of the day, introducing A INSTANT FAN FAVORITE YELENA and giving her the spotlight to get everyone on board while also allowing Natasha to shine. OH AND YALL WANTED SOME TWISTS EH? The twists throughout the movie I personally enjoyed and didn't see coming and I am normally so on point with seeing things coming like that. I figured the Taskmaster twist out a split second before the reveal and I didn't see the ol switcharoo Mission Impossible mask twist coming at all!! I also didn't fully expect all of the other Widows to be the bad guys under mind control.And just to touch on the Taskmaster twist. I completely see why some feel how they were defeated was a bit underwhelming. But to me it made sense. Natasha had to at least attempt to make things right. And as for just not liking their version of Taskmaster...I think it had to be done that way. Or at least come up with a way to the very human Black Widow an imposing iconic villain fans would recognize to get people to watch it but also not make them too strong to where it wouldn't be believable for her to win.Think about it this movie without Taskmaster yeah would still have been great and could have been done almost the same...but would it have sold tickets especially after fans already know Natasha is dead and can probably still know what is going on in the MCU without seeing it. So I totally feel Taskmaster being in the film was necessary.Then addressing Taskmaster's power from the comic books on screen that isn't the easiest of TASKS..haha. So they had to come up with a way that allowed them to explain Taskmaster's powers, display that power visually, make Taskmaster a fair villain for Black Widow, and have it make sense in the MCU. Sure they could have made them a super human with a freaky mind that allows them to instantly predict your next move in battle/fights as well as be freaky strong without any explanation as to how or why. But I'm glad they explained how and why...and NOT ONLY DID IT MAKE SENSE, ADDED A SURPRISE TO THE MOVIE, TIED IN WITH NATASHA'S OVERALL STORYLINE THROUGH ALL THE MCU (a past brainwashed spy who broke free and has been trying to make up for her past wrongs..if you think about it their stories kind of mirror one another like Taskmaster mirrors their opponents moves), etc.....BUT NOW THIS OPENS THE DOOR FOR ANOTHER TASKMASTER TO SHOW UP DOWN THE LINE! I mean we already got how many Captain America type characters now? Cap, all of the Flag Smashers, John Walker/ U. S. Agent, Isaiah Bradley, Bucky Barnes, all of the Winter Soldiers, etc.So just like they brought new Super Soldiers into the fold after Cap they can do the exact same with Taskmaster because it is a scientific/technology based procedure that can be replicated.And if your main gripe is Taskmaster being a girl I don't know what to say really?But I do want to leave this one a few final thoughts....1.) Did anyone expect this movie to be a top 5 MCU film? If not why are some of you treating it as if it should have been so there for it is complete trash?2.) Is it possible that SOME people out there let their expectations and biases negatively impact their experience watching this movie and your opinions about it? I don't think every person who didn't like the movie is only because their expectations or biases or their opinions are invalid...I just think that SOME of them may be going in a little harsher than necessary."
1548,10,"The movie she deserved! Well was it worth the wait? Hell yes! Absolutely brilliant. As per Marvel it's incredibly well made with fantastic action but not at the expense of the characters. Natasha's estranged family are all terrific. Florence Pugh as her sister is typically excellent and is a worthy successor. But the film is stolen by David Harbour as the father and Red Guardian, the Russian equivalent of Captain America who is just superb and has the best lines. This is top notch entertainment. Loved every minute!"
1549,8,"An Upgraded Version of X-Men Origins: Wolverine Black Widow was fun to watch. It didn't so much provide answers to questions anybody was really asking, but it did provide fun trivia on Black Widow while paving the way for a character to replace her.It's kinda funny how much the movie is similar to X-Men Origins: WolverineEstranged SiblingConfronting Traumatic PastOrigin Story for Random Outfit ChoiceLink to Following Movie.Significant Character from Beginning returns in end as Big Bad."
1550,1,"Terrible Absolutely horrible, disney marvels attempt at constantly belittling men while women can break moral bounderies and go unpunished is ridiculous at this point. Please stop!"
1551,5,One of the worst Marvel films yet - and i love most of them. Terrible script The script is probably one of the worst to be done by Marvel so it is not shock that the rest falls apart. The acting is fine and Pugh and Scarlett do their best but some of the storyline is just terrible. It almost becomes a bad family comedy in the 2nd act...and the Russian accents are pathetic. Why hire a British actor to play the villain and he still sounds british. Why not hire the eons of Russian actors that can act the part. John Wick series shows one how to properly hire Russian actors.It is by far the worst Marvel film i have seen and still confused why they hired the Indy director but it is not her fault that the script sucked. CGI was solid and it looked good overall... but a terrible script can never be fixed on screen.A 5 star rating and that is being very generous.Hope next one is better...
1552,6,"Decent marvel movie, that seemed way too long So if you have seen any femme fetale movie, you have seen this movie. As there is nothing novel here. The previous marvel movies hinted and partially showed how badass her character was. Kind of like the alien you barely see is much scarier than the one you see in in plain view and all the script is dedicated to convince you the monster is scary. This movie is the same way, where it's overdone.Overall I he movie has the typical happy hour lucky fight scenes and not too much depth throughout. However the early credit scenes splash human trafficking of girls in a manner that has a gritty feel that feels slapped on, because none of the movie really caries that weight or continued cinematography feel. At the end they slap some script add on to talk about women maltreatment throughout the world in the script. But that too feels slapped on. I am not opposed to the shining light on a legitimate issue. But please carry the torch through the door hole movie equal to the weight of the subject matter. You can't show a scene of a kid choking kn a toy, then slide into toy story 4. It doesn't flow and it undercuts real world issues.There is woman good and men bad tones in the movie, but it doesn't feel as in your face as other films as of late.I did love that my daughter and wife liked it. Finally having more female lead movies was refreshing. The fight scenes seemed way out if the real of realistic, even for marvel. Especially considering all characters were just humans (sans 1 in robot suit) with no real superpowers (other than Russian training and chemicals to control the widows) to speak of.Neither villain (robot or Russian mastermind) felt developed enough for me to see as scary or invested in their character.The movie really is just 3 hours of non stop fighting. And literally everyone fights everyone. Which often makes no real sense other than adding time. To be honest , it was so much, I got bored. You can have a finale, if the whole movie is at the same level.The plot in some parts just felt like a white wash of captain America without a superhero serum.I could go on, but you get the point. It's just frustrating how can marvel make me so invested in black widow in early movies or female Loki in the tv show Loki....but then so under deliver in black widow. Watching this was better than wonder woman 1984 (cause that was horrible) but not as good as Wonder Woman."
1553,8,"What's with all the hatred? What the hell are these people looking for? It was too long I guess and it's true the movie is more about her sister (who is amazing in the movie), BUT the story was very good I thought. So it's not in top 5 Marvel movies but it's definitely better than Hulk and Captain Marvel. While that might not be saying much it was a very enjoyable movie. The family twists and turns were good and the action sequences were decent. I really expected Marvel to be headed downhill fast after the last Avengers movie, but with Far From Home and this movie they left me feeling like maybe they can keep it going for a while longer. I guess if you are looking for it to be a solid 9 or 10 you will be disappointed. But if you are looking to be entertained and enjoy amazing acting (by the rest of Black Widow's family) then you probably be glad you watched it. I don't understand the ""garbage"" reviews. It is far from garbage. A very good 7.5 movie."
1554,4,"Barley entertaining Was extremely disappointed with how they portrayed Taskmaster; it's like the writers have never read a comic book before and just saw pictures of him and someone said ""He mimics people"". And Natasha chews gum with her mouth open 4/10."
1555,5,"I mean... okay, I guess? Is it the best MCU movie? Definitely not. Is it one of the better half? No. Should've been released years ago before the character was already dead? Absolutely. Was the CGI and immortality they gave her annoying? Yes, but no surprises there. Does it actively interact with the other movies? Not really, they tried to tie it up with civil war and ultimatum/falcon and the winter soldier at the end but it wasn't really explaining or fitting with anything particular.All in all, it was a pretty average movie, even though it had a lot more of potential and kinda broke my expectations. I was glad to see more of the character and to get a glimpse of how they might incorporate the others into the new phase."
1556,9,"Fav character, great development I love the backstory of the Widows. I do wish it went into more details about Nat and her upbringing with the Widows prior to getting assigned to her family.I still have some unanswered questions based on other flashbacks from prior MCU movies.Florence Pugh was amazing in this movie and in no way should that be discredited. But when you make a movie entitled Black Widow, I am expecting more about the OG, the one we alll know and love.Great movie, just needed more depth."
1557,3,"Cheaper by dozen Market is full of such product sell something new exiting Just fight, fight, fight nothing else no geadnor tail."
1558,6,"6 is for Scarlett , the movie is a straight 5 ! What did I just saw ? What is the purpose of this movie ?"
1559,8,"Enjoyable I was reading some reviews and i was expecting something really bad, like borderline bad movie from marvel. Nothing at all.It is true that it has some negative aspects, like the movie came a little too late, it should have been released in the proper chronology, certain villain is now, in my opinion, unusable, at least in the current version, and that we will probably wont see any sequel from Sjo due to the known character ending, and lastly, we thought that the movie was going to be scaled relative to the ""superpowers"" of the hero in question (so, none), actually the movie is comparable to the first Iron Man in terms of scale.Sjo did a good job leading the movie, but to be honest, it gave a lot of screen time to Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as she will probably join the MCU soon. She was given a good background, and she has the most hilarious lines in the movie. David Harbour was also great in his role, but i doubt we see more of him, unless he appears in flashbacks.The marvel movies are supposed to be fun, have epic action, with some jokes here and there,. It is all there, it is well executed. Not real complains from my part, other than the villain, timing and that it does little to nothing to advance the story (probably a set up to another solo movie or tv show, but its a long shot).Yes, the movie is almost irrelevant to the MCU. Yes, we might forget it soon. Yes, probably Sjo wont return, but this is a proper farewell to the character that we just didnt had in Endgame. But yes, it IS a good movie, go watch it."
1560,8,"Entertaining Comic Book Fun Appears that many reviewers have grand expectations from a movie about just another comic book hero. Seems as though the low critiques have come from those who jump on the ""it could have been better"" band wagon. Instead, why not accept that the MCU is comprised of stories made into movies that are simply fun, entertaining, and go well with popcorn and a night out with friends. Quit being so serious. This is fantastic fiction!This movie was an enjoyable romp through the past, present and future of Natasha R. The pairing with her ""sibling"" was a great pairing. But let's be clear; the star was Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and NOT the sidekick sister that some have suggested. If you're looking for not-so-serious, action packed entertainment, this movie will not disappoint."
1561,10,"Really enjoyable and strong film Finally a solo Black Widow movie, and it's a very entertaining and strong installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The plot and interaction between the main characters is very solid. I like how it stands out. It's not your typical comic book movie. Worth it to see in the theater!"
1562,7,"Another solid Marvel entry that's not entirely necessary In the grand scheme of things, the long time coming standalone Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow film doesn't play any truly significant role in the extended Marvelverse/Avengers world, but as is now to be expected from the Marvel cinematic wheelhouse (and even more so at the moment TV space), Australian director Cate Shortland's feature film is an above average summer event film that never becomes anything more than you'd expect as it fly's along at a rollicking pace all the way towards another CGI-invested explosive finale.Kicking things off in great fashion with a throwback to Natasha's early life as part of a fake American white picket fence family (Nirvana cover songs included), Black Widow wastes little time getting stuck into the action as we join up with Scarlett Johansson's Romanoff in between the events of Civil War and Infinity War as she becomes estranged from the Avengers team and on a life changing quest back to her home country where she rediscovers old family including sister Yelena, father Alexei and mother Melina.These new additions to the Marvel world are played by scene stealer Florence Pugh (the first of now many planned gigs for her in this universe), Stranger Things favourite David Harbour (getting the films best laughs) and Rachel Weisz and all three performers are a key reason to Black Widow's success and while Romanoff and Johansson get too do more of the same as we've seen multiple times before, Shortland and her creative team maximise the opportunity to add some extra flair and spice to proceedings with these new characters as Black Widow looks to stop Ray Winstone's generic Russian baddie while dealing with deep seeded family issues at the same time.Balancing a nice mix of thrills, spills and perhaps a little too much family frills, Black Widow does feel in many ways like a different type of Marvel film, more Bourne than talking raccoon's and troublesome evil Grimace's and the action and carnage here is mostly frenetic and in your face, more down and dirty than we've come to expect from Marvel previously in this side of their offerings and it helps give Shortland's film a different energy than some of the more clean-cut comic book fair we've had over the last decade.One thing that hasn't changed however is yet another explosive riddled Marvel final act, one that not only outstays its welcome but fails to close out the film in a refined and satisfactory way and where the film worked so well in more singular moments and action that was smaller in scale (other than a prison break out that gets real very quickly), the finishing touch to Black Widow is but another procession of CGI showmanship that is technically of the highest order, but far from overly memorable or gripping. A shame considering the groundwork leading up to it.Final Say -The first Marvel film in many a moon is more of the same solid stuff from a company that has perfected its offering into a finely tuned machine, Black Widow isn't necessary or groundbreaking but its a winner for comic book fans and those seeking quality made blockbuster entertainment.3 1/2 mind controlled pigs out of 5."
1563,8,"More Bourne than Iron Man but Black Widow gets a fitting reprise Good mix of action, humour and drama.Not the most superheroy of MCU films but well worth a watch if you like Bourne style adventure rather than CGI monster fights.It's not afraid to laugh at itself and the dialogue and exchanges between the largely female cast are very good.Judging by the young lad fidgeting in the row in front, I'd guess there was too much chat and not enough Hulk Smash for the younger male audience ."
1564,3,"Alexei saves the day That is to say, Alexei is the only really interesting character here. Not much, really, but, somewhat at least. He's also the only one to have a few funny lines. Others try, especially the Yelena, but fail, miserably.The first half is bad. It's boring, story is weak and, we see a lot of Scarlett Johansson, who has, unfortunately, passed her prime, so, it's even kind of depressing.Then Alexei comes along. He's a breath of fresh air, but, in a feminist movie such as this, they don't let him shine; he's mostly there to be silly.Rachel Weisz looks amazing for her age, almost to the point of looking better than Scarlett Johansson. But, she's not nearly as interesting or funny as it was intended.Similar goes for Yelena, who was obviously meant to be cute and funny, but she's neither.Second half's not _that_ bad, but it's mediocre at best. It makes little sense, even though this is supposed to be ""not really a superhero movie"", so it should make decent amount of sense. The action sequences are pretty bad and the CGI is at times terrible. The Harvey Weinstein references are way too obvious, done badly and are pretty much worn out at this point.From a certain point of view, this is very unfortunate, because the movie set out to prove that Black Widow is good for a stand-alone movie. It actually showed quite the opposite.Skip this one, it will ruin the memory of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, flawed as it may have been, she was fun and looked good."
1565,10,Great as always Can Marvel really make a movie that is not great? It was really great I enjoyed watching this movie.
1566,10,Like always Marvel fan 10/10 for the normal people 9.5/10 Best movie right now to waste your time and enjoy it.
1567,3,"So much talking...boring Well, I decided to go to the theather, bad call. It has been a while since I am hoping for the movie to end. So much nonsense and boring conversations. Very slow pace."
1568,8,"Enjoyable watch! Not sure on the really negative reviews, I thought it was a good insight in to the backstory of Black Widow's past with a real focus on family and the struggles of separation... Action was on point I just wish Taskmaster had my more screen time and having it out with our main lead, thought the back story we good and how it was all linked but overall a good action movie, well done Marvel!"
1569,8,"Enjoyable Wrote a review as saw quite a few negative ones.I think the main issues seem to come from black widow being somewhat indestructible, and the main villain being meh (both fair comments) However I felt this was a very good action flick, loved the main cast, and think it gave a great bit of back story to black widows character. A good epilogue to phase 3.Do agree with other comments that this was probably about 7 years late."
1570,5,"Exposition Action Cinematography was great. The cast was good, the direction was good the, the story was even good. The screenplay could have used a lot of work though. It's exposition, action, exposition, action and keeps on going until it ends. Some pretty good scenes, good characters. Just makes one of the biggest film making mistakes in the book. It tells the story it doesn't show the story."
1571,5,"Don't expect the usual ""Avenger/Marvel"" quality I had high hopes for Black Widow to be a movie on the same level - script, acting, action, grandeur - as the early Marvel movies. (Iron Man, Avengers, Thor, Captain America etc) Instead we got a movie that felt like it had zero connection to the Marvel universe at all, or like it was made by people who hadn't seen any of the previous Marvel movies, let alone worked in any of the productions?!The opening plot was exciting for the first 10 minutes but then it fell flat, and never recovered imho, and halfway through I was convinced Scarlet Johansson was only there to create enough buzz for the others to make a spinoff...I don't know anything about the director Cate Shortland, nor do I want to find out what other movies she's made in the past because this was so uninspiring. Really poor acting - or directing, whatever's at fault?Me and my kids have watched all of the Marvel movies up to the final Avengers time and time and time again - which is a true testament to great movies, but Black Widow is a movie I'll never watch again, which is a shame because I really love Scarlet Johansson when she's really into a role! This was a real ""meh"" moment...I'd hoped Rachel Weisz and Olga Kurylenko would have great parts and really lift the movie but one of them seemed sleeping and the other only showed her face twice - and only had one tiny line... The only one at least trying to deliver was Florence Pugh - which is obviously set to return in a spinoff.I'm putting this Marvel film in the same bucket as most of the newer ones, you know the extra bucket for milking that cow dry to the bone, hoping the connection to the original Avenger movies will be enough to print more money, but I'm getting more and more fed up with how these new Marvel movies are made and gone are the good unique superhero movies, replaced with some cookie cutter - often feminist - replacements, and not good ones either.Your mileage might vary and I've seen reviews ranging from nil to max so please make up your own mind about Black Widow, but it's a Marvel movie I'd gladly had missed despite loving Scarlet Johansson as an actor because she can be really great with a good script and a good director!I know Jon Favreau is super busy and can't make everything himself, but if Marvel is going to continue making awesome movies we need him behind the reigns, or Taika Waititi for doing comedy variants, which I gather this one tried to be and failed so hard...P.s. The spoken Russian in the movie is abysmal, despite them supposedly being Russians... I mean couldn't they have spent a weekend with a speech coach teaching them their lines correctly?! My Russian is far from great but enough to make it feel like a comedy, not an action flick."
1572,9,"AMAZING!!!! This movie is a great insight into the early life of Natasha Romanov before the Avengers, this shows what happend in the red room and how she escaped to join the Avengers and Sheild. We also have the aswer to what Loki meant in The Avengers when he said Sao Paulo Dreykovs's daughter Barton told me everything.You can also learn a great deal of Russian swear words during thsi movie.But one thing i would like to adress from this movie is when Natasha has to break her nose at the end to sever the olfactory nerve, she just keeps talking to Dreykov then wack her face on the table to break her nos, then beats him up, 2 seconds later she tracks down all the widows in the world and white its downloading she wipes away the blood from her nose and cracks it back like its nothing. This really confused me.Also all her hairstyles were amazing in the movie, hers and the other widows and Yelena."
1573,5,"Rename it Black Widow's Sister The MCU is back at its most banal as the first female superhero standalone film kicks into predictable action. Marvel has spent nearly a decade building up the mysterious black widow character's backstory only to have it unraveled and crumbled in an awkward-paced and unnecessarily long standalone film. The inorganic and too often forced sentiments demonstrate nothing more than inferior character development. Marvel had all the time in the world to do justice for a fan-favorite female superhero, but no... and what's even worse? Black widow (AS THE TITLE SUGGESTS) was just that much less of a protagonist, than her little sister."
1574,7,"This is a movie work that can appear earlier! Finally waited for Natasha's personal movie.Although the action special effects in the movie can perform more and more!But it is still necessary to describe the change in Natasha's personal mood.It's just that this is the script after taking the Avengers.In fact, I am looking forward to the most crisis.Other partners of the Avengers will show up to help, to add a bright spot!Unfortunately, I didn't wait for this scene.So overall it complements part of Natasha's personal mood.But she didn't explain enough to be more complete.So at the moment I am looking forward to the next episode too much."
1575,1,I don't know how this movie got 7 stars Half a star rating would deserve.There is nothing in this movie just drama that it nothing else.
1576,1,Worst movie came from mcu I would rather see a drama movie instead of this movie.Boring no proper explanation and no interesting action sequences at all. I don't know how mcu made this movie.
1577,3,"What did you ecpect?... Come one, guys. It's not really their fault that the plot was stupid, action scenes boring and characters flat as a pancake. You forget one important thing - this is still time whan Kang pulls all the strings. Neither of those characters had any free will and all their actions were handcrafted by him.Really, at this point it doesn't matter al all, what happened pre-Endgame. None of the characters could have behaved any differently. Otherwise they would have been melted...."
1578,10,Goodbye BlackWidow Its so sad to let you go Black Widow..I hope this is not your last movie..I love the characters so much. The movie was awesome. Looking forward for Marvel Journey..
1579,2,"Boring, lazy and just plain bad The movie feels very boring and is lazyly written. Action scenes felt over the top and extremely unrealistic given that Natasha Romanov is just a normal human being. Yet in the movie she could have been a female Captain America. And what's up with making her father a comic relief? That just didn't fit with the movie at all.Natasha as a character is so iconic and the movie had so much potential, but that all is wasted in a predictable storyline, boring antagonist, forced and unlikable humor, bad CGI and choppy pacing. I was hoping for a true origin story that actually centered around her youth and Budapest in the soviet times. Not the copy-paste modern times semi-scifi garbage it was.I give it 2 stars, but only because of Scarlet Johanson. Her acting is good. It's a shame that the material they gave her to work with was just plain bad."
1580,9,"If you like Marvel movies you'll like this. I enjoyed this quite a bit. As an off-and-on fan of Marvel films, this one ranks near the top. I appreciated its scaled back nature and the focus on character development over insane action and cgi. And the characters in this are very likeable. The writing is also top notch and very believable for an otherwise unbelievable comic book film. If you like anything else Marvel does there's no reason you won't like this. The 81% rating on rotten tomatoes behooves me- like you know what to expect from a film like this and it delivers and then some, some critics are apparently expecting a masterpiece even given the comic book source material which is totally nuts to me how anyone can rate this poorly unless you've never seen a Marvel movie before and are expecting Titanic or something. There's not much else I really can say about it... I'm not a professional film critic and don't really want to deep-dive into the pros and cons, I just want to say that I think this is great and really stands up to the likes of the latest Thor and Guardians films. If you like those you'll like this it's one of Marvels better films in my opinion."
1581,7,"Widow, Black Widow If you're expecting a superhero movie, well, this isn't one. It's basically a distaff James Bond with more childhood trauma, but for that it's generally good.Like a lot of MCU movies, Black Widow assumes you've watched all the other movies and remember who everyone is. It seems to also assume we'll understand the little story it tells in the credits, which is more impressionistic than informative. I was pretty much at a loss for the first 1/2 hour.At first this movie felt like I'd already seen it. There's a fight scene on a bridge that I could have sworn I'd already seen, even though the movie just came out, and it really took a while before that sense of Deja Vu ended.At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep going, but once the excellent Florence Pugh shows up as the protagonist's sister and the movie starts delving into the nature of family and some moral grey zones things get more interesting. And the final half hour of explosions and twists and hurtling through the sky is impressively action-y, even if no one has x-ray vision.While this movie's insistence on not explaining things to non-MCU fanatics (a practice it returns to in a final coda) and some rote early scenes keep this from being as good as it could have been, overall this is an entertaining movie. Recommended."
1582,7,"A little routinary Marvel What should have been the swan song of Johansson's character, ended up being a kind of routinary Marvel endeavour. With some problems of rhythm and some poorly filmed action sequences (combined with other good ones like the big end piece), the best thing of the film are the comedy sequences, the prologue and some of the acting (especially of Florence Pugh and an hilarious and over the top David Harbour). Still, much better than ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier""."
1583,7,"Not the best but ok marvel movie The beginning was interesting and the only good writing scene it felt like the movie was going to be different then the others but yeah... it was just an average marvel movie. When the villain showed up I was really hyped, taskmaster. I remember him from the spider-man game and thought HE was exactly like the game in the movie but of course it had to be villain who is completely different she just had 5 minutes screen time and the final fight WHAT WAS THAT the fight was probably the WORST end fight in not the mcu but every movie I have seen. Just because widow has mErCy fOr hEr. It's always the same with these movies. They could have made the villain so much better the villain is just a 1/5 for me. But outside the villain the movie is just ok. Like I said it's just the same like other mcu movies, the action was really good but sometimes unrealistic yeah I know it's a superhero movie but black widow is just a human without superpowers you know what I mean if you watched the movie. The cgi where on sometimes awful for a mcu movie in 2021 maybe the budget was lower but they don't had the make it that big whit the space station or whatever that was. The acting was in my opinion actually pretty good and the comedy, they where trying so hard, everyone in the theatre where laughing but I didn't. After everything u have said I never got bored watching this movie And the last thing the after credits scene S H O C K E D me."
1584,7,Good movie but not great It was a good movie but a lot of it could have been better and it should have came out 5 years ago. Great intro.
1585,6,"More Disney-isation of Marvel Marvel character finds a problem.Marvel character calls some friends for help.Marvel character finds out something they didn't know.Marvel character seems to have lost.Marvel character actually wins.Yep, standard Disney/Marvel recipe complete, put it out for people to watch, make a load of cash, rinse and repeat.I'm being really generous with my star rating because they had the guts to actually do a Black Widow movie.Still better than either of the Wonder Woman (I WONDER why I watched them) movies, but that's not saying much.It's like death and taxes now; there's bound to be an iffy Disney/Marvel movie or show along every six months or so. It's got to the point where it's like watching a soap opera because we're only still watching because we're invested in the characters.Soon enough the ""normal"" people will stop watching because they're not invested in the characters in the first place."
1586,4,"Felt more like Spy Kids... Pretty excited with this spin-off from the MCU. They dont showcase much on the street level heroes, so having Widow her on time in the big screen, is a must see for me. Street level heroes tend to be more realistic from all usual the power blasting fantasy like with Punisher and Daredevil. My expectation is the story and action sequences should be similar to Winter Soldier. Applying the same street level formula of the MCU.So I thought.Well, for the action scenes, it was as I suspected, and that ride in Budapest was for the books! But the latter part or finale, it was so so. Storywise, I wish they could have dig deeper to her time as an assassin and the red room. Darker, given she's an assassin. Felt more like a family spy movie, Spy kids anyone? It's a let down. Making this your one of the few non-epicn mcu movies.P. S. What's the deal with Taskmaster, is she like an evil Capt? There are a lot of weapons out there you know. Forget that tiny shield. LOL."
1587,3,"Cheating...Hollywood moving towards Bollywood ****** MILD POLIERS *******Yes, Thats what I will call Black Widow. Absurd Cheating with audiences.MCU thinks they have a nice template and Rendered engines for the Aircraft, CGI, and explosion. Let's make a movie around it. Add some ladies and some crap around it and get 300-500 million dollars. Why would anyone care?Like this was a pathetic movie in all terms.CGI-laden action that is boring and not thrilling at all. All the sequences are alike in MCU. Cant differentiate now. Its overdose and done umpteen times already. With Black Widow a normal human being, I wanted more hand-to-hand combat with some natural action sequences. What do we have is CGI CGI and more CGI explosion and aerial action than again CGI.Wait before I forget, the most irritating thing In this movie was Scarlet Johanson. Yes. The way she was talking and emoting.. Man If you get a chance watch her lip movement again. Every single dialog was said in a way that she has to look perfect pouting lips. Her lips never moved like a normal person's lips and she spoke in a derivative manner that irked me so much. I hated her entirely in the movie. So cringe-worthy way to emoting and dialog delivery.Climax, wow. Just wow. Like a 90's B grade movie. The hero gains control of the computer logs in and the entire control of that empire is in Hero's control in 2 seconds.How does the empire AKA RED ROOM come down? 1 grenade. Yes. 1 Grenage that's launched from a gun and it brings down the entire RED ROOM floating in clouds down. Pathetic.Climax Action scenes were so bad, it looked like an Asylum movie production. If You know what I mean.The illogical and unbelievable climax action would not even suit Iron man, Forget about Widow. Shez a normal human after all.Man, I am so so annoyed and pissed with the way the wafer-thin script was handled. Pure Bollywood. Without logic and utterly unrealistic. And yes, Filmmakers hasn't left a chance to focus the camera to Scarlet's ass. Every single frame, entry or exit. Her ass was the major focus.If the Script had that much focus...This could have been a worthy movie.This was purely a money-spinner and that too a cheesy one.Wait for it come on TV."
1588,3,"Why on earth was I tempted to watch this??? I thought this was going to be a solid action flick and just as good as The Avengers first movie. This movie is just a waste of money and time.I have seen better movies than this: Born A Champion 2021, The Unhealer 2021 and The Tomorrow War 2021( I gave this one a 10/10 rating).This one doesn't even fit into the espionage category of the James Bond action flicks. I believe Scarlett Johansson is the most overrated and pushed actresses of her time. I first saw this actress as a child-star in the Sean Connery-Blair Underwood-Laurence Fishburne movie Just Cause 1995 which is a zillion times better than this tripe.Overall verdict: your generic-run-of-the-mill-below average-pretentious action flick."
1589,7,"Where is Black Widow? Too little, too late Not the movie I was expecting. There are so many negative comments and reviews about this movie, which might have lowered my expectations. Overall, the movie is a fun ride.CriticismThe ""villain"" is generic and it takes too long for him to appear. He is also barely in the movie.The accents were generic and pretty badThe CGI was mehBlack widow takes a backseat through most of the movie, she is almost the supporting cast of her own movieProsI liked the movie! It was not the best, and definitely not the worst one."
1590,6,"Some really good ideas but never compelled. This film had a ton of potential. Black widow is a fantastic character, and delving into the realm of an agent might result in some intriguing scenes. However, due to the length of the film, some scenes dragged on, which drew me out of the experience. Many of the jokes fell flat, and the MCU can't seem to make a film without include cringey quips in otherwise serious scenarios.The performances of all of the actors were excellent, and few fans will have any complaints in that regard. However, some people may be disappointed by the lack of use of certain characters.The lack of realism established in the movie is my biggest criticism. This is a superhero film, so it's understandably unrealistic, but there are a few instances where you can only suspend your disbelief so long before rolling your eyes. Throughout the film, the characters never felt like they were in any actual danger.Despite these flaws, the film still has some enjoyable action and cool sequences that should keep you entertained."
1591,9,"Awe-Inspiring, spectacular, fun film for casual MCU fans This movie made me really appreciate Black Widow more as a casual Marvel fan. Maybe this isn't true to the comics, or the plot/origin story diehard fans wanted, but it's a fun, easy to digest film that highlights Black Widow and her supporting cast very well. One of my more favorite MCU movies. ""Awesome"" was my reaction leaving the theatre. Black Widow goes from a role-player as an Avenger to a star, but not quite the superstar level many were hoping for. The ""new"" characters are very likable and well developed throughout the course of the movie."
1592,1,Black Wid-oh ho ho ho Black Wid-oh ho ho hoYaaawn.Started well.Then it became funny.Then it was boooring.
1593,8,"It's pretty good I went and saw this with my girlfriend. She felt that it was incredible, I'm a bit more on the fence. I disagree with people giving it 1 star reviews, as it really isn't all that bad. Even the weakest links in the MCU (The Dark World, Iron Man 2, Captain Marvel) are much better than 1 star and this is leaps ahead of them. Even if its the worst of the MCU movies, it still deserves at least a 5/10.Let's break this down into 2 main categories, the good and the bad.GoodPugh is incredible and so damn likeable as Yelena, if Marvel want to make her the new Black Widow moving forward, absolutely no complaints here.The opening 2 acts are really well done, especially the first 15 minutes and the opening credits. It started off great.The soundtrack is excellent.The action is fun, Marvel movies are designed to be enjoyable popcorn action movies and this certainly delivered.The BadTaskmaster. I actually wasn't mad about the gender swap, Taskmaster doesn't need to be a bloke to be as effective as he is in the comics. My problem is Taskmaster is a fantastic villain in the comics, and unfortunately wasn't done justice with how she was written.The 3rd act has some pretty below par CGI, and honestly just feels a bit weak compared to the tone the opening act set.-Johanson doesn't really get to star here. Black Widow deserved her own movie half a decade ago and thats probably when this movie should have come out.Overall, this is a good, if forgettable entry into the MCU. I'm glad Johanson finally got a Widow movie and it was about what was expected from Marvel. It's just awesome to be back at the cinemas again and this was a pretty good first movie back."
1594,8,At least better than Captain Marvel Yelena welcome to MCU. Movie start with a prising plot and after sometimes screenplay just gets lower than average.But ending was kind pretty good.And Post credit scene can say it little more than average.
1595,10,"Black Widow Movie a little late BW should have been made about 10yrs earlier but I know that before Wonder Woman the DC and Marvel bases did not think a female hero movie would be successful. Wonder Woman tops charts then marvel releases Cpt Marvel, in my opinion that should have been BW movie. This movie action wise is right in step with winter soldier I loved it!"
1596,5,"Weakest POST-2008 Marvel Movie It could have been good. It clearly had potential but misses the mark.When I saw the 7 of 10 rating, I was surprised but considering 'grading on a curve ' I took a peek at the Hulk 2008 movie and saw that it was currently at 6.7 of 10. There is no way in H*** this movie is better by any metric. This would be a 5.5 if half scores were available - but not a 6.Of course it still has worthwhile moments. It's not a complete dud and no doubt its watchable if not entirely entertaining or immersive or a visual spectacle. And no. My rating is not a result of comparative expectations vs. Other Marvel movies. It's simply weak on its on merits of plot/story.It almost feels like it was made more out of an obligation to the character (and to make money) rather than because they had a good story to tell.This review is deliberately vague on details only because people should watch it in its entirety without focusing on particular singular points I could use as examples. No spoilers here.I'll watch it again in about a month and see if I have a change of heart.But I doubt it."
1597,3,"Black widow is just to open the Marvel's door to other Widow !! "" oh Black widow deserve more in marvel universe guys . Lets make more widows instead !!"" that's Exactly what happens Black Widow isn't the main character - the Comedian scenes in this movie better than the Action scenes -The villain Character is Weak role - the CGI Graphics is Poor.like i said once you watch it you will realize that the whole movie wasn't about black widow .. it was a gate way that allow another characters to enter the Marvel's Cinematic universe ..i got enjoyed the Comedian Scenes in this movie more than the Action Scenes . They did they role to make us laugh but they didn't impress us in action-the main key to make action scenes success in marvel world is Graphical Effects and CGI Quality ( and that something you wont find in this movie ...at all )finally you may love this movie for only 3 Reasons 1- the comedian Scenes 2- the Black widow Reputation that built through all 3 - you may love that because you miss Marvel Movies .since last one was 2019 ( But also you may get disappointed many ways ) and don't forget to wait to the after credit scene of courseHope you enjoyed my Review and Get Masked - be Safe ."
1598,3,"The argument is total stupidity I did not like it, it is for a 3 or maximum for a 4 of 10 points.The argument is total stupidity.Magic powders are thrown, and with that they solve everything, it is UNBEATABLEthe only good thing was the special effectsit was a really missed opportunity, to have told a good story."
1599,7,"A movie that should have been released before Infinity War This isnt to say this film isnt good just seems completely out of place when theres Loki, Eternals and eventually Spider-man 3 that are creating a greater universe where this takes it back down to earth. Both this and FATWS seem to have the same issue of the grandeur of the movie being very small in comparison to the rest of the MCU.The opening is very awkward with Nat have blue hair for some reason back in 1995, the family all together that have to head on the run from the US police and Alexi being able to hang onto a plane but then again he is the Red Guardian. Leading into the credits this has the feel of the Bourne Identity same style of credits and the change up to The smells like the only song from Nirvana that fans know.Then jump to just after Civil war and truly i think this should have been released then! The whole story revolves around Nat on the run from General Ross for breaking the Sikovia Accords plus this new gas that breaks the mind control of the Widows from the Red room. Ross honestly didint need to be in this movie, thought this would have been the start of the Thunderbolts and the only details pointing towards that is that Ross is ill and may be searching for a cure........ becoming the Red Hulk? The rest of the first act is the reunion with Yelena and then the break out of the Red Guardian. Have to say these are the stand out of the movies, David Harbour and Florence Pugh are the redeeming factor of this film. The Dynamic is that teenage daughter that doesnt want to listen to Dad jokes but ends up laughing at all of them! The fight scenes are well choreographed but from the start the CGI doesnt match the grandeur of the scene. They obviously had a budget and that was the best they could do with it. All other series and movies seem to be on another level, even the older Thors and Iron Mans. Not sure if they've changed teams or if this was done on home desktops at home but just didint seem right.The second act again isnt really anything special just them getting to see Melina. Bit of Exposition on what the Tape they stole in the opening and is a lot of mind control breakdowns to control the Widows. They get captured and taken to the Red Room, which somehow is a giant Russian Helicarrier in the sky. A dig at the Russians from the america producers their engines are coughing out smoke compared the american made Stark Tech with the clean blue burning of repulsor engines.The ending this just doesnt excite me, their captured they fight their way out, small hiccup in the plan, over come that, free the other widows with the new gas that was found and then kill General Dreykov. Hes just a boring general with a bad accent very much the same as Danny Huston in Wonder Woman. Just Ray Winstone's accent is far worse!The most disappointing thing about this whole film is Taskmaster turns out to be the daughter of Dreykov, doesnt speak and has a chip that allows her to track and remember movements of people shes fought! This is such an exciting character from the comics and even the Spiderman game on PS5 just made the character a kitted out bodyguard!Overall its a shame this is Scarlett Johansson's last visit to the character, just doesnt hit home as well as her death in Endgame. Standouts for sure are Florence Pugh and David Harbour i hope these are returning soon to the MCU!The post credit works well after a characters introduction in FATWS. As if this was the first moment of them being introduced this would be a total disappointment when thinking the ThunderBolts were coming to the MCU. But totally confirms that Yelena is returning and hunting a bowcasting hero for a certain series!"
1600,6,"SJ's rear end stars in lackluster MCU movie Admittedly, I haven't read the comics. But a few days ago I rewatched all the MCU films in chronological order, so I have them fairly fresh in my memory. All of them have their ups and downs, but for me the key is their entertainment factor, combining the superhero lore with some deep emotional moments and also some good comedic bits. On that base, my favourite installments are Guardians of The Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.That being said, I can't see the appeal that many people see in Black Widow. I guess it's a matter of personal expectations and I guess I was expecting something darker, stronger, more tormented, that would get into the skin of the character, which, admittely, is not one of my favourites of the MCU. Not having read the comics that inspired them, and judging solely from the movies, BW is quite limited to be the pretty, sexy, if cold, female presence. She has no super powers that we are aware of, other than her undeniable beauty (although sometimes she seems to have a disproportionate strength for her size) and an amazing capacity to calm the Hulk. A lot of cartwheeling and pouting, but little else. I wonder how popular the character would be, if it wasn't portrayed by the amazing Scarlett Johansson.If, like me, you want to know more about Nat's life before the Avengers, you won't find much in this film. We get to know little about her past, through glimpses about her indoctrination as a Russian ¿spy?, Red Sparrow style, which is mostly told and not showed. The movie focuses more in the dynamics of her stranged and bizarre family, but this is also showed passingly. We don't get to see how she grew up or how she turned up to be so skilled and lethal.I was also expecting to know more about her relationship with Hawkeye and what transpired in Budapest, but I guess we will never know.And then there is Florence Pugh, an overrated actress, if you ask me. She is not, by no means, a bad actress, but she is certainly no Meryl Streep. I don't understand all the praise she is getting.Her character in BW has the spotlight because that's Disney's marketing choice, but it is underdeveloped. We don't know anything about her or her motivations, other than ""I want to save the rest of the BW"". For someone who has spend almost all of her life under a rigorous and cruel training and indoctrination, she seems quite childish and immature. And of course, there's no hint of the seductive skills attributed to a female Russian spy, because, you know, this is Disney.Scarlett, by the way, seems to be bored and tired of her character and there are some scenes when she seems to be on autopilot. It is barely noticeable, though, since she is such a great actress, altough this kind of films are clearly not the vehicle to highlight her acting chops.As for action lovers, there are a couple of motorcycle chases and some fights, but don't expect to be surprised or amazed by any of them. There are some implausible scenes that require an absolute suspension of disbelief and that, frankly, look quite ridiculous.In short, I wasn't moved or shocked, there are no strong emotional moments or powerful scenes to remember, no shocking revelations or game-changing discoveries regarding the character. I still feel like BW owes her fan love and adoration only to Scarlett Johansson and this film has done nothing to change that perception.Special mention for the debatable casting choices (in spoiler)SpoilerThe villain, really? Don't get me wrong, Ray Winstone is a wonderful actor, but his days of inspiring fear are gone. You will expect someone who elicits a sense of inminent danger and evil or, at least, someone with surprise/ novelty value, as the previous MCU films had (Mads Mikkelsen, Josh Brolin, Tom Hiddleston, Andy Serkis, Jake Gyllenhaal , Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, to name a few).David Harbour as comic relief becomes annoying after 5 minutes and Rachel Weisz looks sleep deprived. The Russian accents are caricature level.And I don't even want to start with Taskmaster, but I'll just say that Olga Kurylenko has finally found a role that suits her acting skills.In another note, what's with all the shots of SJ's rear end, for no apparent purpose? I get it, she's hot, but it feels like a poor stylistic resource. Thank God BW is directed by a woman ..."
1601,10,"Why? People leaving reviews are kindaaa crazy. It's a great movie. Amd on top of that, not boring at all. Like what?!?!?!"
1602,6,"Good action movie. This was a good movie. Reviewing it as a part of Marvel will never get it close, yes, it's not so Marvel type.Pugh and David, mainly Pugh carried the whole movie. Scarlett was wanted in the movie just because of the character, Pugh was NEEDED."
1603,5,Black Widow? Again Who Is She? The whole narration should have been about how she became the BLACK WIDOW we know but ended up following a storyline about where she went between CIVIL WAR and INFINITY WAR.
1604,7,Movie is amazing on its marvel fans. The black widow Is An amazing women trying to help her family and sister and trying to defeat a man that took them when they were kids and they suffer a lot. But they soon defeated him with help. Amazing movie for marvel fans.
1605,6,"Meh- not bad, but nothing extraordinary either. This new instalment could have been awsome. Instead you get the same old, tired formula. A lot of unnecessary fight scenes (the one between the sisters who first try to stab each other, then one says ""peace "" and all is forgotten).The villain is basically a Bond villain copy, not very menacing. The action and CGI are good and there are a few funny scenes.Both Scarlet and Florence are great actresses, unfortunately they don't have a lot to work with.All in all, you get what you paid for, a no brainer popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less."
1606,2,"Abysmal!!! It's just another terrible, formulaic, depthless and piss poor attempt by Disney's MCU at making a 'movie'(yes, I am not sure whether their uninspired cash grabs can even be classified as 'movies' at this point).Unsurprisingly, it's oversaturated with comedy that only appeals to 12 year olds, has a predictable plot, forgettable sequences, a generic score, bland cinematography and an awful villain. The problem is, they took one of the most interesting villains from the Marvel Universe and reduced him into something so pedestrian that he can barely be even called a character.Scarlett Johansson also fails to shine in her own movie. Instead much of the focus is given to building up Florence Pugh's character, which pretty much defeats the purpose of giving Johansson's character a solo movie in the first place. Speaking of which, it's apparent that this movie was 5-10 years too late. It hardly adds anything to the character and doesn't hold any relevancy considering we already know the character's fate.It's blatantly obvious that it's only a cash grab and a feeble attempt at claiming a piece of the woke agenda cake. It fails to offer anything new or interesting. Its narrative and characters have no depth. Instead it's so shallow, just like most of the MCU, that it evades meaningful moments of characterization by wrapping it up with comedy.Comedy is pretty much what these Disney flicks are capable of. However, watching Cuties loving ""professional"" critics justify this trash movie is more hilarious than any of this movie's jokes.Avoid this movie at all costs. Or watch it when you're high."
1607,7,"All in all a fun summer blockbuster Don't know what's with the low reviews because it's like those guys never watched a MCU movie before. Black Widow is on the same level (if not better than some) as all Marvel movies up to this point. I mean you have some cool action scenes, comedic moments and some great new characters so what the hell did you expect that left you so underwhelmed? Also there's no blatant ""women good men bad"" ideology or forced diversity pushed down your throat every few minutes so for a MCU Phase 4 that's a great success (honestly those disastrous miniseries made my standards drop by miles), characters aren't just two-dimensional woke checkpoints and the plot is intruguing and actually makes sense. All in all this is undoubtedly 153 times better than those ridiculous Disney + shows and is actually a decent movie so if you're looking for a fun popcorn ride with friends look no further."
1608,2,SOOOO STILL NO ASAANTE RIGHT!?!?! So Scarlett Johannsen was in the first Black Widow and needed to be in the second one but she couldn't so why did they not cast Asaante Wright a literal lookalike to play him? Can't even watch the movie...
1609,2,"They moving to Fast & Furious As per the subject of my review they followed Fast & Furious. They talk about family in this movie all the time. There are action sequence which are unbelievable. Everyone knows that Black Widow is a good spy and a good fighter but she does not have any superpowers. Her sister breaks a plate on her face, throws her on the glass door, she falls down from a building hitting herself everywhere, her car gets blasted, her car gets hit too badly that it falls down in the subway but nothing happens to her. No injury no blood. Even the villain lady they showed, she blasted a severe bomb on her face as a child but she lives.Oh forgot to mention that bad CGI at the end of the movie. Everyone dies in the copter except for her, its so stupid.It is a total let down movie, nothing special at all. Florence acted well but still all the other characters are horrible and the story is just so average with no good action scenes."
1610,5,"All the action in this movie, you've already seen it the trailer. Movie is boring as fkk. Lacks action too hard. Plot of the movie: Why? Because family."
1611,7,"Don't listen to the angry Fanboys This movie wasn't amazing, and it wasn't terrible. If anything it makes me more mad that Nat was killed off from the franchise, her story is clearly important and so is Yelena's. Cant wait to see what happens from here!"
1612,8,Action packed You have to appreciate the whole story line of the marvel universe to enjoy the great one liners all the way Thur!
1613,9,"Very confused about the low ratings. This movie is better than every captain America movie. Including Civil War. Florence Pugh and David Harbor are excellent, the fight scenes are exciting and well spread out. These low reviews all seem like they're written by Martin Scorsese. This movie made me excited for the rest of this phase."
1614,8,"Ignore the impossibly unsatisfied This is a funny, exciting, heartfelt and action-packed movie with a unique plot and some fun surprises. Please do yourself a favor and ignore the obnoxious social commentary reviews and just enjoy the d*** movie."
1615,7,"Enjoyable yet Predictable! Well, I think it lived up to its hype and finally, Black Widow got a satisfactory movie and a kind of back story in an all 'family' way.The story is about how Natasha running from the S. H. I. E. L. D after the Sokovian Accords deal, the fun fact is most of the movie takes place between the airport fight and escaping the raft scene in the Civil War. The movie doesn't linearly focus solely on the character Black Widow but also on the introduction of several characters and how it lays the foundation for the next phase. The family saga was very good at the beginning and they all had very good chemistry and the comedic relief was brilliant. The antagonist was like always the cliche MCU one where he has the picture of destroying the whole world and pocket it, the problem was the power of the antagonist was let down in a weird way. Had an okayish ending and a satisfactory post-credit scene.I was really impressed with the directing, the acting was just superb(special mention to Pugh and Harbour), the comedy was spot on, and really great opening credits. The storyline was kinda flat and predictable but loved all the Easter Eggs and a good movie for all MCU fans."
1616,2,They screwed taskmaster I loved taskmaster from comics but they really screwed him in the movie. Taskmaster can actually face whole avengers at a time and in movie he is just not great.Watch it for pugh....
1617,4,"Kind of entertaining. A little funny. Just an unbelievably dumb story with pretty bad dialogue, as well. The only redeeming thing about the movie was the sometimes funny and cute family dynamic. Other than that, just cheese."
1618,10,"Recommend Really good movie always doing the best with avenger movies, WATCH until the end."
1619,6,"High action drama with missing emotions The action sequences are great, even the it's humorous as well but the emotion is missing.Black widow also died with iron man but there is no tribute to her."
1620,2,Bored Wow over the top Russian stereotypes with bad acting poor casting I get it that she was raised as a Russian spy agent but it's way to comical and plain stupid to think they act or talk English in a Russian prison with bad accents. But what really can't wrap my head around is the Last block buster Marvel movie that killed the Black Widow off. So why would they make a spin off movie about a dead superhero. It really got boring when they showed up at the pig farm. Hollywood looking to grab some box office cash on Johanssons character for one more movie.
1621,5,"movie is full of hilarious mistakes I would compare this movie to wonder woman 1984, the story doesent make sense, the action doesent make sense but its entertaining.I wont go into spoilers but expect: 1. Black widow getting punched repeadetly and getting trown trough many windows yet she will never get any scratches on her face :) 2. Black widow survives so many things which a normal person shouldent survive.3. Helicopters that get shot to shambles exept for the cockpit which is magicly the only part of the helicopter which is bullet proof and then the next scene abra cadabra the helicopter is repaired again.4. karakters surviving falls from extreme heights 5. More plot holes then a switch cheese.But i did laugh at all these things and scarlet is pleasent to look at so a 5."
1622,8,"One Character Triumphs in an Okay Movie Florence Pugh's character Yelena is a A+ actress for me. She is so funny, cynical, and a true badass. She outshines Scarlett Johansson. She's the only character that makes me love this movie.We see Black Widow's family in the beginning. Somehow the family is under control by a madman who simply controls people's free will. Which is known as the Red Room. For me, I find it dark and disturbing. Especially when it deals with children, manipulations, and having power to control the world.Black Widow wants revenge, however Taskmaster gets in the way. Her family has some dark secrets. But when she meets her sister, the movie tone and plot becomes interesting to watch.However she does not do much. Only her sister Yelena does more action. I don't mind if Yelena becomes the next Black Widow."
1623,8,"Florence Is Love The first half of black widow was very strong and emotional. Florence Pugh was stellar in this movie. She was brilliant in action sequences and I like the fun elements in her character. Yelena and Natasha's chemistry was too good. David Harbour also performed very well.The action sequences were good but CGI was too weak in the 3d act. Also, I didn't like the changes in Natasha's character. She has no superpowers like other avengers. Her strong brain and mind combine to make her a lethal weapon but they showed her over powerful in this movie.The inner wounds of Natasha were beautifully delivered in this movie. I liked the movie but because of Florence only."
1624,2,"Exactly what you'd expect... When it comes to superhero movies, I have come to expect cheap, clichéd plots and poorly directed action sequences. Lame, self-serious dialogue and mailed-in performances are the norm in this genre. ""Black Widow"" adds to a long list of films that are infantilizing mainstream moviegoers... rehashing the same tired material with the cinematic equivalent of fast-food junk."
1625,5,"Meh I didn't expect anything walking into this movie and I'm really happy I didn't hype myself up for it.I think the biggest problem is that this is a movie that should have come out BEFORE Endgame. We already know what happens to Natasha and really the only reasons this movie exists is 1) fan service/a tribute to Natasha. And 2) to set up Yelena as the next Black Widow (if they even do that).The acting was fine, the characters were meh (Yelena stole the show in my opinion, best character). But I think this movie wasn't necessary and brought nothing to the table.I don't even think this is a good send off movie for Nat? It left me just feeling empty. And I don't remember 90 percent of what Nat does in the film, and it's supposed to be a movie about HER.I don't like what they did with Taskmasker or that they made Nat and Yelena adopted sisters/sister figures (in the comics, they aren't related at all and don't see each other that way).But hey, that's my opinion. Glad some people got enjoyment."
1626,7,"It Is What It Is When it comes to Marvel movies, one could only expect the best of the best in terms of production and cast members. However, in the case of Black Widow, the amazing production seems to forgot a key aspect of the film (two, to be exact): plots and characters. Don't get me wrong, it is emotionally impactful to see Natasha confronts her past and put a resolve into it. However, the film didn't seem to dive deep with their plots and characters and just basically touch the surface. The result is an entertaining blockbuster that constantly makes the audience feel that something is missing."
1627,7,"I liked it It's just your average Marvel movie. Far from Marvel's best work but also a long way from their worst. It's funny, there are good action sequences, and it has a likable main character (ahem Captain Marvel). Besides that I don't have much more to say."
1628,8,"A fun ride a few years too late This is your typical summer Marvel blockbuster. A fun ride that doesn't require you to use much brain power to enjoy. Just grab some snacks and sit back.The most disconcerting part of the film is that no matter what, we already know that ScarJo will be fine since this movie takes place right after Captain America Civil War but before Marvel Avengers: Infinity War & the conclusion of the Black Widow story. Simply put this movie does not work as well as it should have had it been made right after Civil War. This was more of an ""Oh crap! We forgot to give ScarJo her own movie. Let's write something up quickly.""Also to make things clear there is only one post-credits scene. For some odd reason there are many articles claiming that there are 2 when this is false. The scene many are referring too happens before the credits roll and is in fact just the last scene. The PCS is a setup for the next Disney+ Marvel show which if written well; may be a fun ride.The good thing about all these Marvel shows is that they do not need to be forced into yearly seasons; they can simply add in a season when it makes sense in the Marvel Universe timeline to add to the overall story with a focus on sub-characters."
1629,8,"Oh look, another female lead marvel movie the fan boys hate The movie isn't that bad. It's not the best, it's not the worst."
1630,6,Forced Marvel Film This film feels forced doesn't need to exist. I still found it enjoyable. Better than some other marvel entries. Black Widow has no powers all of the sudden in this film she seems stronger than Captain America. Surviving extreme car crashes and fallen from a high altitude. She does not receive one scratch. Taskmaster was a total fail one of the worst MCU villains.
1631,6,"My favourite MCU character is Black Widow but... :(( I'm quite disappointed in this movie, first of all, because she's my favorite character and second because for the MCU it leaves a lot to be desired.I think the movie should have addressed a lot of issues not only in the beginning but throughout the film.Black Widow is a character who was always very mysterious and reserved, so this movie should have surprised us more and put the protagonist in her corresponding place, far above what was put in this film."
1632,9,"A True Film with Strong Female Lead Character I'm grateful for all the people involved in making of Black Widow film for not putting any unnecessary feminist stuff in here, to prove that you can make a great movie with female protagonist without making it annoying. I respect that."
1633,9,"The Most complete character created in the MCU and they went and killed her Black Widow is the one single worthy creation of the MCU. That is the single creation that was actually created in the MCU. Yes, like all the other Avengers she was also originally created in the comics books, but unlike all the others Black Widow of the comics books is a collection of fragments that sometime contradict previous ones, not a real living breathing creature like Captain America, The Hulk, Iron Man. Even The Vision and the Scarlet Witch got more character built for them in the comics books (which the MCU failed to use, but TV seems to be taking it over now). But the Black Widow we come to know and love is the creation of the movies the directors, the writers and more than anyone else - the creation of Scarlett Johansson who made Natasha Romanoff her own.Now there are two possible reasons for her demise at the Avengers Endgame - either she didn't want to keep on doing this role or the directors producers decided they didn't want her anymore. I've been thinking a lot about this issue. I've listened very carefully to Scarlett own words regarding her role as the Black Widow. I can't believe she didn't want to keep on doing it. She probably won't say a thing, she's a professional and she knows the rules of the game, but she knows she still had more to give as the fiery spy she created. The problem is why would the creative team of the Marvel MCU want to finish her off? Well, as I said I thought a lot about this question and I personally believe she became too big for her own good. They never thought of her as anything more than a secondary role and were surprised themselves by her growing popularity, popularity that forced them to give her a full size movie dedicated to her exploits. But they couldn't let it grow any further, so they killed her and I personally hate it more than any other stupid thing they did in Endgame in order to surprise us.Now, lets examine this movie for itself. It doesn't always make sense. Like I wouldn't advise anyone to try severing a nerve to the brain for a minor example. But on the other hand it has wonderful roles and superlative acting by the entire cast. Even if some of them don't really have the complete character making sense like Natasha Romanoff does or like the great complete roles written down for Florence Pugh and for David Harbour. Ray Winstone gets a very good villain role to play, and he plays it well. They all do even, the incomplete ones like Rachel Weisz. So we get an action film with a very big heart and a very big moral issue carried with it. It may not be to everybody's liking but I personally loved it, and I don't think Scarlett Johansson would have taken it any other way. I'm not going to discuss anything else regarding this movie - it's all done very professionally and it's all beside the point."
1634,8,Not that bad It's not the greatest but not the worst of Marvel.
1635,10,Decide for yourself The movie in my opinion is amazing! It's a lot darker than most the other marvel movies. I cried in the first 15 mins. Yelena is basically as awesome as nat. It was worth the wait.
1636,5,"Clearly running out of ideas Will try to review this in a plain English language without using any clever words.I'm 30min into the movie and struggling to continue watching it. Mainly because can't seem to undesrtand the point of this movie? Or, what was the reason this movie was made?The only explanation I was able to come up so far is like imagine you are watching the Avengers, then Tony Stark goes to the toilet to do a number 2.. as a result, he's absent from the movie for about 10min.Producers: ""Oh, let's make a 2 hour movie about that!"""
1637,2,"One of the best villain/anti-heroe absolutely ruined. What was the point of making taskmaster female, and why was his/hers origin story changed?Another thing that bothers me is how they absolutely nerfed this character to the ground. How can black widow posibley be on same ""power level"" with taskmaster? The rest of the movie (5/10) is okay I guess."
1638,4,"If this is what the next phase of MCU is all about then I'm out There was a real opportunity with this film. It could have been a gritty backstory about a difficult upbringing. That would have been interesting. They could have made Natasha all Jason Borne'd up and showed her dark espionage skills. That would have been interesting. The training of an assassin and the emotional dichotomy of a paid killer. That too would have been interesting.Instead we got two hours of unimaginite ""plot"" with phoned in dialogue delivered by bored actors riddled with Clichés and borrowed scenes from other, much better movies (and I bever thought I would say that about Moonraker) . The only respite was being able to giggle at Ray Winstone's pitiful attempt at a Russian Accent. As he would say on the adverts. When the fun stops.... Stop."
1639,6,"Should've been made before she died....after thought IMO I don't know about anyone else but I feel like this movie would've been way more enjoyable watching it before Natasha died. It was hard for me to get into it knowing that she dies in Endgame. I wished it had been Hawkeye instead of her because she was way more interesting and I just liked her character more. The only foreseeable reason that the MCU would even make this movie would be to set up the anti-avengers which you see the clip at the end of this movie and setup the ""new black widow"" character. The relationship between Natasha and her sister was good, I felt. I chuckled at how she made fun of Nat for flipping her hair.... The Red Guardian was a bit of a let down to me. He reminded me of Mr. Incredible; fat, out of shape and just trying to reminisce about the good 'ol days. Now about the task master, That was horribly executed. The fact that it was the villains daughter.....really? When the taskmaster is fighting it's clearly a male stunt person in the suit. The actress that plays taskmaster is a fairly small woman and to me that was laughable that they would even try to pass that to the audience. Also, there is literally no build Up to this character..... I would have been highly upset if I would have paid money to watch this movie. IMO it's easy to forget and watching it makes me wish they had not have killed off Natasha Romanoff. RIP Nat."
1640,2,"I have definitely been widowed This is a movie for the brain dead. I have watched almost every marvel, my kids love it and I do too. This was the most disappointing.I suspect Covid had something to do with it but that's no real excuse. The action at points was good but it seem to have no depth to the character, I simply couldn't see the sense in any of it. I guess Marvel wants to make this into a post covid cash and with the cinema release, I have no doubt the whole place will fill up and they will cash in but it's simply not worth wasting your money unless you are just looking for a night out and any film will do.It feels like some of the reviewers on here are paid to shill this film. Won't be surprised. Utter garbage."
1641,4,"Not cool Marvel I'm sorry but Marvel is not like it used to be... I loved anything related to MCU and seeing now this, makes me feel so disappointed, this was not meant be, it's awful WHY, WHY Scarlett???, Anyways hope this ends here with this one and we don't loose that spark that used to characterize this kind of movies, in Loki's words ""Such deseperate attemp its pathetic"""
1642,8,"Really long wait for it I waited this film for one year because every month they postpone it.The final result was really interesting and it's always curious to discover the past history of a character especially black widow that was a main character in MCU movies. In fact we saw she for the first time in the 2010 year in the film: ""Iron man 2"". It was 11 years ago.In this film i find a lot of sentimental, action and funny scenes. All of them perfectly balanced in this amazing movie.Enjoy it and remember to don't miss the post credit scene. Watch and read the credits don't be hasty."
1643,4,"Boring Action, Flat Storyline and Forced Drama. Black Widow is completely forgettable. Not without it's merits Black Widow quickly devolves into Marvel formula checklists.As many people are saying Florence Pugh is the highlight of the film though that can be said for every movie she stars in. Not sure if it was intended to have Yelena be the most interesting character instead of Natasha? The chemistry with between Pugh and Johansson is decent enough, and the initial fight between widow and task master was cool.The family drama is forced. The dinner table scene moves from flat comedy to drama in order to create artificial conflict with the main cast.However Task Master eventually takes a back seat to the forced family drama and the reveal at the end is predictable. The action itself is one of the most disappointing aspects of the film. None of it was exciting and it's been done better in other marvel movies. Every fight is quick cuts to hide the stunt-double. All of these A list actors take big money but don't put in the effort to learn choreography so we can understand what the heck is going on in a fight. The constant reminder I'm watching a stunt double took me out of every fight in the movie. When the Marvel 3rd act CGI battle happens Natasha turns full CGI and it's boring. All the action is dull and lifeless. Another problem with the action is how slick and boring the style of the movie is. There is no grit in Black Widow. Marvel and Disney are too afraid to take any chances with a tone or style of the movie. Instead of making this solo film something suspense filled and grounded we have a marvel movie we have already seen a million times before. A missed opportunity to make a grounded superhero feel real. Sort of like what Nolan did with his Batman trilogy.Eventually everything ends in Black Widow after the overlong final battle and everyone is super happy. Natasha changes her hair color and everyone can be happy leaving the theatre. Yawn! Black Widow is pure formula. Never taking any chances to deviate from the path set by ten years of previous marvel films. Everything is so convenient and tidy that I want to roll my eyes. Black Widow never made me gasp in excitement, tremble with suspense or tear up because I become so invested in the characters. Comfort food is what Black Widow is and if that is your thing you're most likely very easy to please and right dumb reviews like the Top review for this movie, or your as sad as anyone who looks at reviews on IMDB and dislikes them because they have differing opinions than you. If you fit into either of those categories I'm sure Black Widow is the movie for you. High production values does not equal substance. You love Black Widow but Hate F9? What is the difference here?"
1644,4,"Disappointing Finally marvel made a black widow movie that should have been made about 5-6 years ago. The first 20 minutes of the movie was actually pretty good. But the rest not so much, the third act was a complete mess and some of the writing was so weird, also they completely wasted Taskmaster, very disappointing and how can Yelena outshine Black Widow in a Black Widow movie? This just feels like more of a movie setting up the Yelena character in the mcu than actually making a good Black Widow movie. Just another mediocre marvel movie that could have been better than just meidocre."
1645,7,"The Widow is Back in Black! The Short and Sweet It's good! Go see it. Action out the yin yang, humor, family drama and it even has room for a rug pull or two. Marvel is back, baby!The Boring and Pretentious ReviewIt's been a while, huh? The 'rona put the brakes on Marvel's Phase 4 designs and it's taken more than a year to get back on track. Damn you, 'ronaaaaaaaaa! Was it worth the wait? Well that depends on your own perso-oh the hell with it, hell yeah it was worth the wait! Black Widow comes roaring into theaters this month to remind us what makes Marvel movies so damn fun and, boy, has it been about damn time.Ostensibly an origin story, this functions more as an expansion of Natasha Romanov, aka the Black Widow character history but the operating word here is action, action and dare I say it, even more action.Not quite a sequel, not a quite prequel (a midquel?) the film is set immediately after the events of Captain America: Civil War but follows more closely The Winter Soldier both in style and tone and could well serve as that film's spiritual successor. Like in Winter Soldier, director Cate Shortland and writers have opted for a cold war era style spy thriller. Don't worry if you haven't the director's name before, I hadn't either. After this she will become a household name joining the likes of Patty Jenkins from Wonder Woman giving the boys' a run for their money in directing comic book movies. And she ain't the only one. The ladies are running the show here with Florence Pugh and Rachel Weisz joining Johansson and a stellar cast that includes David Barbour (Hopper from Stranger Things) and Ray Winston, just in case you thought this was merely a filler film until the heavyweights arrive later in the year. This Widow is punching well above her weight class.Johansson always dominated her MCU scenes with Cap and the Avengers and here she is given chance to flesh out her character. But the entire cast displays a strong showing with Pugh, Weisz and Barbour in particular clearly enjoying themselves. They do such a great job it would be a shame if Marvel and The Mouse don't keep using these characters in the future.The film opens with a wholesome scene of Americana before cleverly setting up its spy thriller conceit that extends right into the opening credits. The action hijinks start early and they are frantic and non-stop with fight scenes that look choreographed by somebody that studied their Jason Borne well. Fights that feel desperate and immediate and make use of whatever household items happen to be around in order to subdue or kill an opponent. Violent gun fights, car chases, martial arts, it's all here.But besides all of that, Marvel's genius continues to be in the menacing villains it continues to come up with to antagonize the heroes. In The Taskmaster, they have another memorable one, a fighting power house that can imitate anybody's fighting style just by looking at them. The scenes featuring him are some of the best in the whole movie.To be fair, the film is not without its flaws. The plot gets a little convoluted at times and some of the action seem over-the-top compared to the tight groundedness of The Winter Soldier. And depending on your taste, its denouement will come across as trite but these are minor quibbles for a film that was such fun getting you there. A self-aware, action packed Marvel flick with maybe more than a hint of #metoo commentary, this injects a rejuvenating shot into a character that was by all means supposed to have been over and done with. Can't wait to see what else Marvel has in store. And of course, don't forget about that after credits scene!"
1646,7,"Supporting Cast are the Highlight As predicted, David Harbour and Florence Pugh did not at all disappoint in their respective roles. They were able to provide that Marvel comedy we all know and love, but also the emotional connection. Scarlett was herself, and if anything it was nice to see her play Black Widow one last time in her own movie.Action wise it was well done and what we've come to expect from a Marvel film. The fight scenes with Taskmaster and costume were exceptional, however the character reveal/motive was a bit lackluster.As far as being ranked in the MCU, it would fit right in the middle, possibly even lower tier. I wouldn't say that's a slight as I find them all entertaining."
1647,8,"Pretty good I don't get all the vas reviews, honestly thus movie was good, reminded me of The Winter Soldier in a good way, maybe a bit late considering the time line and could have been a better send off considering what happend to her in End Game but anyway Pretty good time overall and a nice MCU movie."
1648,3,Boring First disapointing marvel movie. It was extreemly boring so I watched maybe 2/3 then I left.
1649,7,"People gotta chill with 1 stars Seriously this film is in no way a 1 star film. Too many people trying to drive the score down because they didn't like the fact there was some cgi or the fact they're too impatient to sit through a slower paced build up. Says more about the attention span of the individual than the film itself. For the movie I loved the build up and showing black widows whole family, you know because its her movie. The whole point of this is to show her back story and we get that. It is funny in parts, the script isn't 100% perfect, but its a big dumb action movie, what are people expecting? Pugh Is incredible and the stand out star, she steals this movie. Harbour is second to that with his brilliant performance. I really enjoyed this and you will too."
1650,6,"Black Widow After over a year of waiting, Black Widow was finally released, and let's just say, it did it's job, but there was so much more to be said. Cate Shortland did a good job on clarifying events and ideas from the prior MCU films, while also doing a decent job on elaborating on a fan favorite character like Natasha Romanoff, but she definitely could've fleshed out the plot a lot more, making this film feel a little bit like a filler/setup, to the saga. With the events Shortland was telling, I feel as if this film was released a few years ago, it would've been more hard-hitting, and relevant, more than feeling a little redundant with not a lot of consequences. Black Widow had a pretty solid pace, up until the second act, where it seemed to slow down, and really drag out that two hour and fifteen minute runtime.The protagonists are what really carried this film to be as good as it is, having wonderful performances across the board, from Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour. Everyone was balanced well, and had really good chemistry together, especially Johansson and Pugh. My biggest issue with the film, is how they handled the Black Widow character. Yes, we received some decent input on her character, but she didn't really do too much, reminding me a lot of Prince T'Challa, from Black Panther. Another issue I had, was that they didn't make a strong, present villain. Shortland decided to make the villain more of a ""talked about threat"" (if you will), falling into the trap a lot of the MCU films have, and that's not having a strong villain.The action in the film is a mixed bag. There were some scenes that worked for me, being very entertaining to watch, but there was a surplus of action that was butchered up in the editing room, and gave it a silly, video game feel.Overall, I would definitely see this film at least once, because of the importance it has to the saga, but this falls in line with the middle of the pack films for the MCU Saga."
1651,6,Mild Entertainment Many people are too harsh on the movie as far as I've seen but I disagree. The movie starts off pretty good with the childhood section and maintains a decent pace for some time. It's towards the 3rd act where it's starts becoming slightly boring but enjoyable nonetheless.Pros:1. Cinematography (great) 2. Acting (Good) 3. Vfx (good) 4. Direction is decentCons: 1. Action Scenes are pretty generic 2. Task Master 3. Woke female empowerment messages that are too on the nose 4. Long runtime.
1652,4,"Disappointed I am disappointed by this movie. Too many action scenes, and fake emotional ones, poor humour. Also, there is again the old story of ""bad Russia"" and ""good USA"", and I thought the cold war is over. Russian accents are ridiculous and fake even to me and I am not Russian. I mean no Russian would ever pronounce Jelena and Natasha as they did in a movie... The list is endless... I expect the rating to fall around 5 as the time is passing by. Perhaps it is still ok for the audience who is bellow 15 years old, but then again for them it's too much violence, so not sure for whom is this movie made then? Good point - I like that it is filmed on different locations and that is a unique opportunity to see a glimpse of those for people who don't get the chance to travel. Also actresses are handsome."
1653,5,"Good to see another Marvel film but not one of the best. I had a gripe from the opening credits.... We expected to watch Black Widow last year so whoever likes the MCU already knew who was in the film apart from..... Olga Kurylenko. Her name was one of the first to appear on screen so I immediately knew she was Taskmaster; a famous actress who isn't seen, it was obvious. I know we live in different times but when Se7en was released Kevin Spacey's name was nowhere to be seen so it was a genuine surprise when he first appeared on screen.When they land in Cuba towards the start... What on earth was that shoddy CGI?!? It looked like a toy plane landing at speed.Ray Winstone's accent was awful and it distracted me from any perceivable malevolence.The red room being a hovering station was a horrible reveal, I mean, nobody questions jets appearing in mid-air anytime someone needs to go somewhere?I thought the final 20 minutes we were being spoon-fed everything from the pheromones mean you can't attack him... Cue scene insert 'OK guys, in case you didn't get it... I'm going to break my nose so I can hit him' To the 'he controls everything from that room but you still have to access the mainframe"". All felt like an old school James Bond ending to the film without a threat to the world."
1654,4,"Produced too quick and too dirty Want to save 2 hours of your life? Just watch all trailers for this, they're fun! By this you can watch all the cool stuff of this movie wiithout watching the boring rest."
1655,5,"A Decent Action Flick I think Black Widow lands as one of the more average films in the MCUs filmography. It isn't daring and inventive like Guardians or Ragnarok but it isn't ""make me cry"" boring like Captain Marvel or Dark World, it's more on the scale of something like Iron Man 2, a great cast, a story with some interesting elements but not much more. The film does teach you a bit about what Black Widow was up to inbetween Civil War and Infinity War but when something like the Loki finale is releasing 5 days later it feels as if Black Widow isn't contributing much to the MCU canon. One big thing I noticed as well that kind of shocked me was some of the shoddy VFX work, there are some parts with explosions that look like they could have been ripped from an early 2000s X-Men film.If you're a MCU fan this film will satisfy you and I will admit that sitting in the cinema for the first time since lockdown started in the UK and watching the first marvel film to be released in around 2 years I did have a great time, excited for what's going on in the rest of phase 4 but it it's off to a slow start."
1656,7,"Fun! By tackling some hard-hitting themes of childhood trauma, loss of free will, family (or lack thereof), grief, and haunting guilt, Black Widow could've easily deceived us into believing it really justified its existence, hadn't it eschewed drama for comedy and action. What we got is a middling Marvel effort with a rehashed spy thriller story and its affiliated action set-pieces and plot clichés. Granted, that very spy flavour that bleeds into each act more and more evidently endows us with a couple of slick action sequences that are pulled off with aplomb. It's just unfortunate all of them are devoid of the slightest tension. While on the subject, there's no real sense of danger I feel each time either Natasha or Yelena are supposedly at risk, and The Taskmaster completely fails to prove an imposing threat, that's not to mention it's a villain that's clearly merely skimmed over, with the result of falling victim to the plot's mishmash of clichés. The humour isn't the worst, largely due to Pugh and Harbour whose chemistry elevates each scene they share a great deal. The third act feels the most superhero-y, with a fair share of explosions and CGI-heavy scenes that almost feel incongruous with the relatively small-scope MCU installment Black Widow aims to be. However, It's also here when we get some emotionally-charged moments where Pugh - yup, once again - and Scarlett get there moments to shine, serving a fitting send-off for our titular superhero. Moreover, all of these shortcomings can be tolerated given the joy one gets out of this movie. I was surprised how much time flew by minutes before reaching its post-credit scene that got me really pumped up to see what's coming next."
1657,9,Black widow really flies Scarlett Johansson really shined in her last adventure which featured a stellar cast of supporting actors and let me tell you that the action never really lets up. I found the movie like any other Marvel movie a great watch and it had plenty of explosions and stunts that defied gravity. The only gripe I had with this film was the undercooked villains. Really in my opinion is that the only great villains of the MCU have been Loki and Thanod. All in all I would watch it again but only on Disney + when it becomes available to stream at no no charge.
1658,4,"Out of respect for Scarlett Johansson I will not give it a 2. As a family and HUGE Marvel fans we hated 97,7% of this movie. As a mom I found it actually desturbing how they portray girl-trade. The story try to create a connection with a whistle and a few fireflies, but in my opinion a total miss. Love you Scarlett. I'm sorry for the bad review."
1659,8,"Better than I thought After hearing mostly negative things about the film and coming in with low expectations, I might say I rather enjoyed the movie, I felt Natasha and Yelena relationship on screen was entertaining and funny. I would have liked to see more of the taskmaster fighting both the sisters and also knowing that Natasha is dead is a bit off-putting.Hopefully, Disney can make a Disney+ series to bring the character back."
1660,8,"Marvel Does It Again While BLACK WIDOW may not be the best entry in the Marvel film series, it is a remarkably good film. The performances and production values are consistently excellent. The action scenes frequently thrill while not being as over-the-top as in some comic book films. While the Red Guardian is quite funny, this is probably a more serious film than some other comic book adaptations. The slightly more serious tone makes a few plot improbabilities harder to accept."
1661,10,Man literally all the hate means nothing The movie was amazing. It's that simple. Action movies have a different standard and this was a great action movie. The cast was genuinely fun and the movie was engaging.
1662,1,"An Honest Review Oh, look at that, IMDB is doing it's purge of anything not in line with the new political order again... including criticism of Disney.I guess the good news is that, well, like BP and Transworld, it is only going to have glowing reviews when the admins get around to knocking out everything that doesn't praise it.It often amazes me the amount of effort they put into censoring reviews on films as if they were somehow a thread."
1663,2,"Indestructible Humans, Overuse of CGI This movie rating definitely sits at the bottom of all Marvel's movies. I stopped watched after the prison escape scene, and continued the next day when I have nothing to do.The main characters survived car bombing, fight with a supersoldier, falling from the sky, beaten by 10-15 trained killers at once, & many more fatal encounters without any broken bones.CGI is everywhere in the movie. The helicopter emergency landing (due to empty fuel) looks like it was made by an intern student learning how to use Adobe.Redroom is a massive object floating in the sky, sitting there for god knows many years without being detected by radar, or even naked eyes from below. OMG.Watchable. Just dont put high expectations."
1664,7,An in depth voyage to Black Widow character I don't expect much before seeing this movie as some friends already give the impression that it was boring. Turn out the movie got a good storyline and acceptable CGI. The fighting scene is awesome plus the plot twist leaves you curious of what would happen next.Overall it is a good addition to MCU especially to those who still miss her after she sacrifices herself in the Endgame. Avengers assembled!
1665,10,Amazing Just Wow. This movie was incredible and Nat and Yelana were beautiful.
1666,7,"Just a decent movie Nothing to appreciate. MCU would have done better, so much expectation from the mcu. Black widow deserved better."
1667,1,Ew Just plain Ew.Left a taste in my mouth like dry lasagne sheets.Only reason to watch this film is if you like Billie Eilish in a tank top.
1668,3,"Fun, but really lazy writing... I'm a huge MCU fan, and was looking forward to this movie. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was left pretty disappointed by the end of it.The action sequences were fun, and the comedy made me smile a few times, but the writing was incredibly lazy.I mean, they made Natasha (a non-superhuman) practically indestructible against an armored, tech-enhanced, super soldier.The whole plan to take down the Red Room hinged on her ability to sever her olfactory nerve by slamming her face against something just right, but not so hard to daze or knock herself out? Right... They could have at least surgically severed it, and had her manipulate him into thinking it wasn't. Nope, she slams her face on the desk, because that better shows how good of a spy she is.Then the Red Room is just floating in the sky with some artificial clouds obscuring it - and nobody ever noticed it?There's all that shrapnel falling directly over-head, but the parachutes are left unscathed?Just incredibly lazy. It shouldn't be this difficult to suspend disbelief."
1669,6,"Good Send-Off for ScarJo You're most definitely not alone if you've been waiting patiently for the release of Marvel's Black Widow, after over a year of delays thanks to a certain world-wide pandemic, your patience has finally paid off. Originally slated to release May 1st of 2020, Disney pushed it's most recent Marvel release multiple times, eventually settling for a July 9, 2021 release. Well, with that day finally here, and a $215 million world-wide opening weekend, it's easy to say that everyone who either flocked back to the theaters, or caught the film through premier access on Disney+, was eager to see the official launch of phase four's feature films.Black Widow tells the story of Natasha Romanoff(Scarlett Johannson) directly following the events of Captain America: Civil War, where she turns on her fellow Avengers to aid in the escape of Steve Rogers' Captain America and Bucky's Winter Soldier, thus violating the Sakovia Accords. The film however opens up in a small 1980's Ohio town where we see Natasha living with a seemingly normal family. She has a Mother, a Father, and a sister, but it is quickly revealed that this normal family isn't a family at all, rather one of many global Russian sleeper cells just playing the part. Forced to flee the country and separate, queue opening credits montage, Natasha and her sister Yelena are taken back to their homeland with several other girls to begin their training for the Black Widow program in the ominous Red Room run by Soviet General Dreykov.Jump ahead 21 years we find Natasha on the run from the U. S. Government, and Yelena, a Black Widow, on a mission with her fellow widows. Yelena, after acquiring her target, is hit with a mysterious red gas that presumably breaks whatever mind control or brainwashing she seemed to be under. Later we find out that these vials of red gas are antidotes to the mind control tactics used to train Black Widows in the Red Room. These vials contrast the vials of Super Soldier serum we see in Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Enter Taskmaster, Dreykov's elite assassin trying to kill Natasha, who receives a package from Yelena that turns out to be the antidote. She is prompted to return to Budapest after her escape from Taskmaster.Yes, we finally get some context on what happened in Budapest all those years ago with Hawkeye, and don't forget, it's Budape(sh)t. Once there she is forcefully greeted by Yelena, in a former safe house where Hawkeye aided in Natasha's defection to S. H. I. E. L. D. years ago. Holes in the wall made by arrows were appropriately referenced.We then jump to a secluded Siberian prison where an aged Red Guardian, their former fake father and now serving a life sentence, is easily defeating every prisoner in a game of arm wrestling before being interrupted with some special mail that includes an earpiece connected to Natasha and Yelena ready to break him out of prison. Action and mayhem ensue.With a narrow escape, the three set off to locate their former ""mother"" Melina, one of Dreykov's top scientists researching the effectiveness of his mind control tactics. The family theme eventually takes center stage as the four are back together again for the first time since Ohio. Natasha seems to be the only one that's bitter about the thought of them as a family, and rightfully so with the film revealing that she was in fact taken away from her biological mother instead of being picked up trash from the street, but Yelena argued that it was ""real"" for her.The end begins at the Red Room, hidden in the clouds, with an action packed sequence reminiscent of the aerial battle at the end of Captain America: Winter Soldier. The four working together to take down Dreykov and free the current Black Widows. Also, by this point in the movie you may have taken notice of the amount of the color Red in this film. The Red Room, the red antidote, Dreykov's red screen. When discussing themes and symbols in film, red is used to signify blood, hate, murder and anger, but considering the russian influence, it's also juxtaposed with the influence of the color red from Russian history.Family and loneliness are common themes that are included in so many books, tv shows, movies, etc., but the subtle approach to such broad themes in this film are refreshing. It doesn't feel like the overbearing, ride-or-die with my family feeling that you would get from a Fast & Furious movie, but rather more explores the ""we hate each other but have to make the best of it"" side of family. Natasha has always known that these people are not her real family and has revealed that her abandonment is something she thinks about on a daily basis. She has always been alone, until her days with S. H. I. E. L. D. and the Avengers, and even then she still felt like an outcast because she was the hero with a terrible past. After the events of Civil War her family is taken away from her again, which would likely explain why she was so hesitant to join the side of Steve Rogers in the first place because of that fear of losing family and having to live a lonely life on the run once again.I know we are all well aware of the absolute absurd amount of fan theories that plague the internet these days when it comes to everything Marvel, especially the MCU, and we should all know by now that these theories are indeed fun, but frequently are mostly wrong. They usually include guesses on who the next villain will be, which hero will be introduced next, or which comic will be adapted to the MCU. If you were expecting one of these theories to come to pass, you may be disappointed. I found this film to be an odd choice for introducing the fourth phase of MCU films. It still very much felt like an Infinity Saga film, with some James Bond qualities, even though it seemed to hold up on it's own as well.The actors outside of Scarlett Johannson were all quality picks. David Harbour plays an aged Red Guardian to the T, offering some comedic relief to his character. Rachel Weisz plays Melina, perfectly capturing the evil no nonsense side of her character. And Florence Pugh plays Yelena, who I must say could easily take over the Black Widow role in future Marvel projects.I know this film has had a lot of time to build up expectations, but don't expect this film to blow you away. It was nice to get answers to questions we've had for many years and it felt like it was a necessary send-off for an actress and one of the original Avengers who has been blessing us with her talents for so many years, but in the end, it felt like an older movie that was made to fill in some blanks."
1670,4,Entirely forgettable Was really looking forward to this movie but was disappointed. It isn't terrible but the storyline and characters are forgettable. This side quest was neither wanted nor needed and I think avid Marvel fans expected it to be a true origin story. Florence Pugh was a rare bright spot with her humor really hitting the mark.
1671,6,"eeh It's just alright. Black Widow is decidedly one of the more forgettable entries in the ever expanding MCU, a moderately entertaining movie that sadly came out at the wrong time.The movie follows Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson); a character anybody who has so much as walked into a toy store will be familiar with, after she reconciles with her sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) and works to finally take down the elite assassin organisation the red room.Along the way there are multiple side quests starring characters that ranged from memorable one liners to flat exposition providers that I had forgotten by the time the end credits scene rolled. All the performances in this movie are very solid, however Florence Pugh in particular stands out to me as being very good in her role as she is in most things. The issue with the characters stems from the writing, as a lot of the comedy fails to land and I found it difficult to be emotionally invested.I don't think Black Widow was a bad movie in itself, but it failed to capture my attention with its plot and didn't break any records for great character writing. I think if the movie were to have been released pre infinity war I may have enjoyed it more, as it is difficult to connect to the movies main character in a prequel set before a movie so reality shifting as Endgame. I would recommend the movie to Marvel or Florence Pugh fans, however people who are not fond of Marvel's awkward and inappropriately placed jokes will probably not enjoy it.Thanks for reading :)"
1672,2,"Couldn't wait until it was over Superhero, the key word is hero. This was like watching a super power family intervention. Hollywood: endless fight scenes, car chases, and broken people aren't entertainment."
1673,7,I enjoyed it but it is nothing very new or amazing. There is a lot of action in this and a lot of women in tight uniforms jumping about.It has a female director and Scarlett J is one of the producers but there is little feminist message here.It is an enjoyable film with a couple of great actions sequences but there is far too much CGI.Non British viewers might be surprised how great Florence Pugh is in this.
1674,8,"Great Movie but a Little too late This is a great addition to the MCU and it's a great female lead superhero movie. This movie had a good plot and great story. All of the actresses and actors were great. Scarlett Johansson was great as black widow like always , also Florence Pugh as Yelena was amazing she brought great laughter and energy to the role and was a great introduction to the cheater. Taskmaster was a bit of a disappointment and the main villain was disappointing as well but besides that I really enjoyed the movie. But I do have another problem, it took too long to come out. It's a great movie don't get me wrong but I feel like it should've come out in 2016 after civil war. The story takes place right after civil war so it doesn't make sense to release it right now. In conclusion, I really enjoyed this movie and I would highly recommend it."
1675,8,"Good and fun MCU movie. Exactly what we need right now. I honestly don't understand people giving this movie low scores and pissy comments. On visuals and audio alone, the movie deserves a 5.Anyway... It was wonderful to se Scarlett back as our beloved Natasha Romanoff. Florence Pugh was an amazing breath of fresh and fun air in the MCU and all in all, it was a good stand alone flick that gave me exactly what I wanted (and actually more laughs than I thought I would have): entertainment. Don't walk in expecting to se Endgame 2.0. Sit down, enjoy the new interpretation of Nirvanas Smells like Teen Spirit in the intro and just let yourself be engulfed in the universe we know and love."
1676,3,Boring Marvel :( After such tons of Amazing movies why the hell on earth did marvel make such movie. Noone asked for this . The plot is just too much simple... Ok lemme explain u ... Black widows past+ Soviet captain America+ Some action scene which will hype you.. at at last same nonsense ending with some VFX. This reminds me of Dunkirk which I actually got bored but there was only VFX. This is mini avengers with only black widow in it😂😂 and her family...Although credits scene was better coz we got lead on Hawkeye series... But credits scene also foolishly done because black widow sacrificed herself she was not killed :(
1677,4,"Disappointing The Taskmaster thing was stupid, disappointing, the movie collapses with every minute that progresses."
1678,9,"the movie was fantastic The movie was good,but i didn't like the fact that they focused into the mind control and human trafficking more than natasha's past i was hoping to see more of her life back then with clint in budapest,it would have been better if they taskmaster as a real villain not as a mind controlled one.overall the movie was a good introduction to natasha romanoff."
1679,4,"A complete failure!! I was pretty excited for this movie, but this is way below than my expectations. The only reason i give it 4/10 is Florence Pugh. She was brilliant. The story of the movie is certainly not up to the marvel standard and neither is the villain, which appeared barley in the movie!"
1680,1,"Super boring and predictable Movie is slow paced and artificially filled with cgi. It's so predictable that even a 10 year can tell you full story midway. Iam pretty surprised with marvel that they created this movie. Feel bad for scarlet and entire cast. They have wasted such good characters, action sequence are very flat and full of cgi."
1681,2,"done it, been there, and way better James Bond, Mission Impossible, Jason Bourne, Batman, that's just to name a few, but that movie doesn't even come close, 90% tech and action is ok, but if there is only 10% substance in a movie (and I'm being generous), considering what we are going through these days, hollywood could step up to the plate not manufacturing mediocre movies anymore instead of trying to make boring money makers, it would be a great service to humanity to balance let's say 50% substance, and 50% money."
1682,5,Zzzzzzzzzzz😴 Boring! I literally was checking my watch to see how much longer I had to wait before it was over.
1683,9,"No Mission Impossible But The MCU Is Officially Back Watched Black Widow . The film Features Scarlett Johansson(Jojo Rabbit) as Natasha Romanoff /Black Widow, Anthony Florence Pugh(MidSommer) as Yelena Belova,David Harbour(Stranger Things) as Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian ,Rachel Wiesz(The Mummy) as Melina Vostokoff , William Hurt(Delivery Man) as Thaddeus Ross and Ray Winston(The) as Dreykov.Watched Black Widow I really enjoyed also Florence Pugh Yelena Belova is a Breakout Character its not mission Impossible but it did in a pinch also Marvel is Officially Back sorry Wandavision MCU Film will be Superior to TV.Direction from Cate Shortland(Lore) No Mission Impossible But The MCU Is Officially Back 9/10."
1684,1,"Pathos, stupid and boring Pathos is a new role of marvel. A lot of stupid illogical moments and scenes. Couldn't finish to watch."
1685,5,"The moral of the film: all men are idiots Why almost every female lead movie shows ALL men as babbling idiots? In this case, the villain guy Dreykov is supposed to be this evil genius but somehow gives away all the secrets for no reasons. Father (Alexei) is a babbling idiot the whole movie, acting like all Russian men are clowns who drink vodka, possess superhero power but never uses it. Natasha's assistant (Mason) basically a male servant, who needs kind words from her to feel better about himself, gets hurt when girls make fun of him. The government guy (Secretary Ross) another idiot with a lot of power that he can't use to catch a single woman WITHOUT superhuman powers.Why men would ever pay money to go see this in theaters???Yelena acted like a man the whole movie more or less. And that's why everybody saying that she carries the whole film, while Natasha had this sad/confused look on her face the whole time.What makes Natasha the Avenger in the first place? There're hundreds of girls just like her.I love watching movies with female leads, and always enjoy a good story, but why to make all men a bunch of idiots? It's sets a bad example for young men who watch it.Go watch Anna (2019) and you'll see the difference."
1686,5,"Everything looks easy for our NATASA Well it is all an out Natasa's movie. Loved to see her in a individual Marvel space. Expecting more in the continuation and can already connect the dots on where it is going with bucky, new cap and Yelena.There is a big BUT. I couldn't connect with her emotinally. I wish they could show her past more. The family reunion was good but it was too fast to connect. The story has loop holes in many places. Not convincing at all. I watched the movie in 3-4 breaks. And finished watching just to see post credit scenes.As usual Marvel always find ways to put humor in scenes, kudos to the writers.The action sequences are pretty much super heroic it would have definitely give great experiance in theater. But on OTT platform it is missing that spark.In the end it is a good bye to a great Marvel character who has shown emence potential to overcome from any situation. Without having any superpower blackwidow survived and gave great life lessons. It could have been much better send off. I Would love to see Scarlet in different roles in the Marvel Universe."
1687,8,"Dark and Satisfying Like the finest dark chocolate, this one's slightly bitter, but ultimately satisfying. The dialogue is sharp and knowing, while the effects are as spectacular as you would hope. Lots of great talent in the cast ensures this one is well worth seeing."
1688,10,Action film of the summer so far two thumbs up OK so let's start by saying that I was expecting to like this movie however what I didn't expect was to absolutely love it there's action to the core as well as a few belly laughs and and a good time I highly recommend it to almost everyone.
1689,5,"Boring Widow MCU's Wonder Woman wanna be falls to the lowest. This movie proved ""Too little,too late and full of stereotypical events that all of the action movies have. They try so hard to make us foucs to the film with unnecessary explotions and mediocre fight scenes. I think this movie is to forget by all of the MCU movies."
1690,6,"Not great, but has heart I had mixed feelings when I left the cinema. On one hand I really liked the relationship stuff between Johansson and Pugh, but on the other hand I was really bored each time there where big action scenes. It would have benefited from less action made entirely practical (no CGI) to fit the grounded tone of the film."
1691,4,"The movie would have been better without Black Widow in it TLDR: The movie is an inconsistent appeal-to-emotion-narrated patchwork of shaky-cam action scenes. Black widow was the worst character in the movie. The Marvel-element was shoe-horned into the movie by forced dialogue rather than actual cameos or plot points, it seems. It comes across as mediocre at best.___ The characters surrounding Black Widow are actually pretty likeable. Her sisters personality is, by far, more human and relatable than Black Widow herself. Funny, capable and witty. Her father is the sorely needed steretotype driving marvels comic relief, I guess. Her mother was, if nothing else, somewhat interesting occasionally (But with an oversimplified and nonsensical cookie-cutter plotline).Yet most things driving the narrative relates to black widow, which is a shame. Her character is by far the least colorful of the bunch, and most of her dialogue sounds like words of a soon-to-be-converted bleeding heart idealist rather than a trained double agent with a dark past. Instead of dealing with the grey areas and moral dilemmas a spys life contains, it is a continous appeal to emotion and family. Her sister would have been a better protagonist, honestly. As an R-rated noir movie, this could have been a smash hit.SO many of the plot points are just lazy. Anti-mind control chemicals? The evil mastermind revealing the grand plan in detail? Pheromonal locks? An air fortress? Come on... (and why didn't she break her nose before the hormonal lock situation anyways, when she was fully aware of it in advance?)To compensate for shortcomings like this, grand action scenes and super powers followed by humor could lighten up the mood. But even as a hero, Black Widow seems underwhelming, as thousands of widows seems almost as competent and Taskmaster completly pulverizes her. She is just one of many. And with very little time for any emotional development, it is hard to find a reason to get invested in her, specifically. The action scenes seem like a fast and furious film rather than a marvel film, with quick cuts, shaky cams and limited visibility. To save money, maybe?Which leads us onto the next point: It seemed underfunded, as they felt the need to talk about the avengers ALL the time but not including any of the heros (or villains) in a single scene. The Marvel-element was shoe-horned into it, it seems.In summary, a pointless cashgrab with non of the limitless potential it had utilized. I am not saying it is the worst, but it isn't good. And it could have been! Such a shame."
1692,5,Meh I doesn't do anything for the MCU.The action scenes were well choreographed but besides that the rest of the movie is bland. The dialogues are mostly cringy. The acting wasn't the greatest.If you are a MCU hardcore fan watch it. But know that you are not missing out if you skip this one.
1693,7,"Just a fun watch... I've been waiting for this movie for soo long and I must say this movie was fun, and the acting was really great and everybody did their best and the action was amazing it felt so realistic in a superhero movie if that made any sense. I wish I could watch this in a theatre."
1694,4,"Something is missing I expected a bit of darkness to be honest, like getting to see what exactly happens in the red room and portraying the pain and suffering the widows endured in full details instead of just casually dropping it in a middle of a conversation.. it's just another family friendly action movie. Fun to watch, but forgettable and could have been a LOT better."
1695,5,"Started out good..went downhill fastt I loved it so much (in the beginning). BUT it lost it's momentum really fast. After they helped their 'father' escape from the prison, it was pretty much a borefest. And the ending was felt so generic. Ofcourse they had to have a big baddie and a big building in it with everything exploding and all that. Very original. I wasn't invested in the story overall and the women assasins. I mean, we dont really know those people. They don't even say anything. So why does the movie expect us to give a damn?This had so much potential. But the writing was lazy i think. Florence Plugh did a terrific job though. Her dialogue and acting is top notch. I say see it for yourself, but dont expect a solid movie. It has its moment here and there for sure, but overall is pretty mich forgettable."
1696,2,"Just disappointing... Sorry, this does not deserve an average rating movie. It is dull, cliché and predictable, over-action-hyped overrated movie. Don't waste your time."
1697,7,"Adding colour to history, without disturbing the Timeline Taking place first in her preteen life and then between Civil War and Infinity War (with some other flash backs in between) the film tries to fill in some plot holes for those time periods the other films haven't, while seeming to set up Natashas replacement, given we know her fate in Endgame.Compared to other MCU films this is a lot more hand to hand, as befitting the Widows way of fighting. Iron Man presses a button and the bad guys fall down, here it's more like a series of dance moves showing off their amazing training, and there are some well choreographed interactions.It sadly doesn't pull off the same level of comedy as Ragnarok; Red Guardian is just a buffoon in comparison to Korg and Co, while Natashas fixer seems to spend much of his screen time asleep, but it has some good lines that keeps it moving along at a good speed.Prequels are tricky for a series character; you can explore extra details to their lives - such as Natasha talking a bit more about her history with Clint - but ultimately they have to end in a situation that links to something that's been filmed before. You can't have a character die in a prequel, when you know they're alive in a previous film that takes place later in the characters timeline (unless the future character is actually a clone or has some other subtle change made to them). This does seem to reduce the risk to life here - Yelena is listed in the Hawkeye series - though in what capacity this Widow will take is still to be decided."
1698,9,"Look at the reviews who hated it and you'll notice a trend... They're almost all men.I've seen people say the movie has too many fight scenes AND that there are not enough fight scenes. That the actresses are 'lazy' and that the men were better actors (huh... I wonder what they're really trying to say).I've heard people say the plot wasn't good enough for a Black Widow send off; for some of those people they might genuinely believe that, but for others it's a thin veil to disguise their dislike of a female-driven movie. And, honestly, neither of them really understand this movie.This could not have been a better send off to Natasha. Admittedly, the action sequences were not as polished as Captain America: The Winter Soldier's, but that's an incredibly high bar. Black Widow's CGI was no worse that Infinity War or Endgame's! It was believable enough to be good and to have me thoroughly engrossed and impressed. It was a LOT of fun and each of the characters had moments to shine as absolute bad asses (Natasha in particular).The humour was entertaining and genuinely had me laughing (if you have siblings you'll totally understand) and the found family trope was actually very well done (definitely better than the limp attempts made by Whedon and the Russo brothers). In Whedon's Avengers they'd barely had time to feel like a family before he and the Russos started ripping them apart. With Black Widow, to avoid spoilers, all I'll say is that there was tension and the characters were complex and flawed but the film doesn't forget what its main themes are. I loved it.As for the plot? Again, to avoid spoilers I'll be vague: if you're a woman, I'm sure you'll agree with me that the villain is an absolutely vile creature. Both terrifying and, for many of us, so very real.If you know and understand Natasha Romanoff as a character at all, you'd understand that this movie, this mission, is the most important and most *personal* one she's ever been on (bar the one in Endgame, of course).And don't listen to the criticisms about Yelena. She's perfect. She does an excellent job of being the device that propels Natasha's plot and at the same time she's a fantastic character. They all are, to be honest.Of course there were some minor flaws, but show me a single action movie - or any movie for that matter - which doesn't have a few niggles here and there. Overall, this was a great way to say goodbye to my favourite Avenger and I for one, finished the movie feeling thoroughly entertained (and I haven't stopped thinking about it since).Don't listen to the haters. They don't *get* it."
1699,4,"Underperformance MCU Really this is the reason why I'm more into DC. The whole movie just feels forced. Just one encounter with the villain. Rubbish backstory (if there was one) and almost no character development. It's just a film for kids really, very immature. Maybe DC doesn't have its universe as good on point as Marvel but at least the villains give a thrill, the backstories are actually there and everything feels more mature overall. Sorry Marvel but you lost me on this one."
1700,7,"Perfect casting EXCEPT... If you watched The Americans on FX and enjoyed that you'll enjoy the spy family dynamic of this film. Florence Pugh as Yelena Balova was a stand out for sure. What they did with Task Master though was TERRIBLE. I'm all for gender swapping that wasn't really my issue, the fact that Disney is known for impecable CGI and de-aging managed to put a women's dainty head on a male body builder's made to throw ppl was disappointing. Dreykov could have made his daughter into anything he wanted, including some version of Tony Masters... like ""you gave me the son I always wanted"" for the reveal. The girls name was Antonia after all. A missed opportunity in my opinion."
1701,8,"Great Film! Don't go see it looking for comic-book accuracy. The movie is great. I really like how this film felt like a spy movie and less than a super hero movie. There were a few cheesy shots of explosions that did have my eyes rolling. Yet, it did a really good job telling untold characteristics of Natasha's character, why does she really became an Avenger, and the whole Red Room organization was well crafted. Yes, the fact that it is known that this film takes place between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, it does reduce the sense of stakes in the story since we know Natasha will come out alive no matter what.Talking about other characters, besides Scarlett Johansson still killing it as Black Window, the person who will probably will steal the show for most audiences will be Florence Pugh character ""Yelena Belova."" At this rate, it looks like Phase 4 of the MCU is taking an aim for the next generation of heroes who will take on the next Thanos; Sam becoming the new Captain America, Spider-man the next big hero like Iron Man, Scarlett Witch will probably will have something for Doctor Strange in the sequel, Mataie Portman will become the next Thor, and Yelena will be the next Black Widow; We'll see. There is an after-credit scene at the end. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour characters brought that sense of family in the story and were more the comic reliefs for the movie, but the chemistry between the actors and characters worked great in my opinion.Now, lets talk about the elephant in the room and my believe as why a lot of people are hating this movie. This is where SPOILERS get serious. Taskmaster. I will say, I like what they did with the character. The fighting style is the same as the comics, SHE studies her opponents, mimics their movements and find weaknesses to oppose them. Yes, Taskmaster in the film is a female not a male like in the comics. And yes, Taskmaster is only in the film for like 5-7 minutes of screen time, and she is not the main villain. Taskmaster is the character to clean up the bad guys mess a.k.a the minion. I believe that there was a lot of hype for Taskmaster since the marketing for this movie sold Taskmaster as the big threat of the story, which she kind of is and at the same time not. What did I like about the character? The connection and the reveal on who she was. Especially it set-up more menace to the main villain of the story, and more reason why Natasha, one of many Black Windows, is considered a hero. And the villain in the story actually works great, he has a personal backstory with Natasha that really tells a movie that does feel like a story that needed to be told, and not one made just for money.This is a great movie and a great send off to one of the original Avengers. This movie is meant to see on the big screen and not on TV. Like 97% of all movies based on literature works, this just influence on some aspects of the comic books and creates its own story. I am not much of a comic book guy, never read anything outside Spider-man, Batman, or Superman. This movie is great, and the MCU has done a lot of changes and we now know that we can expect a great set up for the upcoming future. Yes, there is a potential for a Black Widow 2 or for material left in this movie to be explore later in the cinematic universe. My recommendation, don't go see a movie with a mind set that they will make a page by page film from a book that everyone will know how its going to end."
1702,6,"For all of its flaws and lack of originality it's still immensely entertaining Black WidowAvenger Natasha Romanoff aka 'The Black Widow' gets her very own stand alone movie.Whilst it took a while for this movie to come to fruition I can't say it was entirely worth the wait. The plot is banal and forgettable relying on the crashy smashy action scenes to hold the audiences attention.Just like Logan's backstory was teased in the X-Men franchise, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had a past that was touched upon in the Avengers movies. Her scene with a captured Loki in 'Avengers Assemble' was most intriguing and begged for a spin off film to explore Romanoff's past. Like The Wolverine's solo outing 'Black Widow' doesn't deliver.No where nearly as bad as the X-Men Origins movie but still a flawed piece of story telling and a missed opportunity.'Black Widow' is entertaining and offers some excellent performances by the cast involved. Except perhaps Ray Winstone who's Russian accent drops in and out more often than a dodgy WI-FI connection. Set pieces are grand as you'd expect in a Marvel movie but the end product lacks venom (and I don't mean the Marvel character played by Tom Hardy).There's no depth to this movie. Unlike 'Logan' the redeeming Wolverine movie, 'Black Widow' is all polish and garnish. There's some nice character interaction. The family scenes are comical and well played out but I constantly got the sense that all this had been done before in better movies. The car chase scene was lifted straight from 'Mission Impossible'. The prison break reminded me of 'Deadpool 2' and the falling fortress in the sky was done better in the Captain America sequel. Even the fight choreography had whiffs of John Wick and Jason Bourne. That said for all this films flaws I was still immensely entertained. Whilst I won't be rushing to shell out for the 4K Blu-ray I will once again indulge when the movie becomes available for free as part of my subscription on Disney Plus."
1703,7,"Just entertaining. I'm not a fan of superhero movies, ""Black Widow"" works well without be a masterpiece, decent performances from the cast and a superb performance from Florence Pugh. The cinematography is simple, the action scenes are not that cool and the special effects are bad. An entertaining film but not amazing."
1704,5,"Was not needed Black Widow is that marvel movie which was not even needed. The character is dead and now bringing movie about her didn't make any sense.The whole movie is normal. The plot was normal, not great. The pacing was bad and movie looked long. They ruined the taskmaster. I was excited to see this villian after hearing so much about it but they mismanaged the character. Marvel is also known for adding jokes in their movies but this movie had stupid jokes. You may not even think of laughing of their jokes. This movie just had action and nothing else.Overall, this movie was normal marvel movie which you can give a try but don't expect too much."
1705,9,"The Origin within Can Phase 4 start with another Origin story? A movie that works without any knowledge of what has gone on before or what will happen next? I would argue that it can work. Of course having some knowledge of the timeline is not a bad thing to have. And while this starts off before other big events, it mainly plays between Civil War (which was an Captain America movie, even though all the Avengers were in it) and Infinity War.And it sort of literally closes a gap and gives us more Black Widow. Yes this movie was something a lot of people wanted to see a long time ago. But the way they put and the story they are telling - it works quite fine. It is more of spy thriller kind of thing rather than a superhero movie (a lot of superhero kind of stuff still happens) - there is even a clip on the telly (TV) showing us James Bond.But amongst all the action and all the frenzy and all the becoming or growing as a character (Black Widow but also her allies), there is a lot of family stuff happening. Which is funny, considering that the family thing is a front. Now I am not alone in saying that this is an allegory not just on family life but the American (way of) Life. And while the addition of the American Pie song might have been an ad lib or last minute addition, it sums it up really good in more than one way. And just when you least expect it, the song also might get a tear out of you. Or at least make you sentimental.The performances are great and the way a big machine like Marvel still allows performers to do and bring their own ideas shows on screen. The chemistry between the characters and the fun they are having on set. And then there are pigs - a friend was reminded of Bullets of Justice ... I have to admit, this could work as a prequel to that too (this is a violent movie, do not seek it out if you are easily offended and squeamish).All that aside, yes there are ridiculous things happening, yes many things are removed from reality, but it has quite the courage to go places, that you may not expect - for a Marvel movie and all that. And when towards the end ... well a certain piece of music/theme is playing ... if you have been a fan of the Avengers universe and the movies before, you will get emotional. I can guarantee you that.And as always there is something in the credits. Actually after the credits (this time no one left the theatre, they have been trained well like myself) - one little scene that sets up a ""future project"" ... which is not that far in the future, but you'll know once you see it."
1706,9,"best solo movie from marvel Loved this film, the wit and acting was top notch.Didn't like the post credit scene though, sets up a story arc that is either dumb or dumber."
1707,4,"Russian bad guys played by British actors still happening in 2021 I found this all very contradictory and I'll getbwhat I didn't like out of the way first;Despite being quite modern with its strong female cast and characters it is also very old with evil Russians who live in squalor amongst pigs (literally in this case), drink heavily, don't shave and don't wash etc.The attempts at dry, quick-wit comments is akin to 30 year old James Bond titles which they seem to allude to without shame which really doesn't work well with a Disney production trying to plug family values while killing and blowing up dozens of people.The story and characters lacked depth to the point that a few people (fewer than 6) left the showing I was at and didn't come back.Personally, the most disappointing thing for me was the amount of explaining the characters were doing for the sake of the audience - it came across as if Disney/Marvel were worried about how dumb their audiences might be.On to the good points...While still very action driven, they seem to be learning their lesson about dragging out prolonged action scenes, although characters do keep coming across conveniently discarded guns, parachutes and the like. The music score was pretty good. There was a nice blend of some young/new and old actors.On balance they did pretty well for a Marvel/Disney production and it will probably keep the fans who are familiar with the rest of the franchise happy. Although if you take it as a stand-alone film and measure it against wider cinema then it's pretty weak and unmemorable."
1708,6,"Entertaining but unnecessary Black Widow is finally out. In 2021. But I strongly believe that it should have been released somewhere between 2010 and 2012, which then makes me ask myself, why? What was the point of this movie? We already know how Black Widow goes out in Endgame, so there was little to no tension as to the fate of the character. I am not sure how this movie will ultimately build up into a much larger phase 4 of the marvel universe, but I guess we just wait and see. There are some ideas here and there and some few things they might do in the future, but generally, this movie can be easily scrapped out and nothing will lack in the grand scale of the universe. But I am getting ahead of myself.I know I sound so negative towards the movie but I actually enjoyed it. I found it entertaining and at no point did I switch my mind off from it. It has good things going on for it, but it has its flaws, flaws that too big to ignore and to some extent, have affected my overall rating of the film. Before I begin though, there are some things I would like to put across first. There are two ways to look at this movie, as a spy action film and as a marvel movie. This review will focus on the latter because that's what the movie was made to be, a marvel movie. And probably because it would fail hilariously as an actual spy movie. Another thing is that I have watched this movie only twice and so, maybe in future some of my opinions may change. Lastly, this review is only my opinion and what I thought about the movie on a personal note, so feel free to disagree.To start off, I will go through some of the positives. The acting was solid in this movie. Scarlet Johansson is Black Widow the way we know Black Widow. She plays the role to perfection like she always has. Florence Pugh is brilliant as Yelena. In the hands of another actress, the character may have easily come out as cocky and annoying, but Florence handles it perfectly well, and the character is actually likable. But the highlight is David Harbour's Alexei. This guy steals the show, literally in every scene he is in. He is what you might say is the comic relief of the movie, but has a decent amount of story that he does not feel shoehorned into the movie.Another thing I respect this movie for is that it does not pander to a certain demography of people. Despite the lead roles being females, the movie does not feel like it is entitled and it actually worked very in portrayal of the main characters as human being and not instruments of agenda. Unlike other recent pieces of media like Ghostbusters (2016), the Batwoman TV show and Captain Marvel.However, the biggest positive I saw in this movie was the action scenes. I really loved the action sequences. The fights were well choreographed, despite the obviously noticeable stunt doubles. Those scenes were the most engaging scenes in the movie for me. The action scenes were well done and it felt like a marvel movie, in a positive way. I wish to also add that this film is also technically brilliant and it looks impressive. The score of the movie is also solid.Oh, and before I forget, this might be minor, but I really loved the post credit scene. That's the much I can say about it without spoiling any if it. But I really loved it and I am waiting to see how they advance with that certain plotline.Now we go to the negatives, which unfortunately are more that there were positives.First, I didn't like the setting of the movie. This movie is set after the events of Captain America: Civil War and before the events of Infinity War. But maybe I missed something in the marketing, but I was expecting a story that took place before Natasha joined the Avengers of even SHIELD. So how weird it was to see one of the original Avengers getting a solo movie after we got a couple of ensemble movies. And to make the matters worse, we already know that Black Widow dies in endgame, making this movie just a product of fan demands. Another thing is that, by playing around with the timeline, a lot of things don't make sense. Like I said earlier, the movie would have been better if it came out in phase 1 of marvel films. As it stands, there are some plot holes. For instance, all the destruction that supposedly takes place in this movie will reasonably attract a lot of attention from the world or at least the Avengers or even SHIELD. And you would expect for such things to be mentioned in Infinity War. Well, that is if there was a plan, but we now all know that this movie was just a mere afterthought. Another thing is, where was Tony Stark? I mean, Natasha chose to fight for Tony's side in Civil War, so you would expect that he would be there for her when she needed him too, but too bad RDJ has no more contracts with marvel. Last but not least, I remember the ending of civil war, just right about the time Tony was reading Steve's letter, he was notified that the imprisoned avengers were escaping and then we saw Steve Rogers in the facilities where they were being held, suggesting that he was the one orchestrating the operation. But at the end of Black Widow, she says that she has to head and break out the other Avengers from prison. So, who did what? Was it Steve or Natasha? Or both? I get that this movie explains how they got the aircraft they had, and maybe they did it together, but it all feels forced. It didn't feel planned and even if you watch this movie immediately after Civil War, it still wouldn't make sense. Even more the reason I felt like this movie was an unnecessary entry in the franchise. I am sure there would be a lot more inconsistencies if carefully examined, but you get the point.The other thing I didn't like about this movie was the protagonist. Don't get me wrong, Johansson does a really good job with what she had, but the character of Black Widow has some flaws when it comes to the writing. First, I don't know if it is only me, what made Black Widow so cool was the mystery that was the person. We didn't know who she was, where she came from, how she got all the skills she has and what her personal motivations were. She was more of the person who got things done and she was such a badass. I had even thought that Natasha Romanov was her alias and not her real name. So, a movie like this may decide to go one of two ways. Either keep Black Widow a mystery that she was, or explore her origins. If you choose the latter, you should go all the way and explore the depths of the character. This movie seems to linger in between. It attempts to explore the origins but does not give enough depth, which ended up making me feel empty. The movie is somewhere between being an origin and being an action adventure and unfortunately it does not give enough of both. There were a lot of good ideas that were unfortunately not well developed. For instance, I would have loved to see the dynamics between the Red Room and SHIELD. Also, this was a movie where Nick Fury would have perfectly fitted. There is also a lot of mention of a past mission between Black Widow and Hawkeye whose outcome played a huge role in the plot of this film. I honestly would have preferred to see that movie instead of what we got here. The Hungarian mission would have made a perfect adventure movie. Another thing is that the movie establishes huge world changing stakes, the plot with all the widows, that I couldn't help but think that this mission would have been something for the entire Avengers team and not just one character, especially not this late in the franchise.Still on the point of the protagonist, the main character felt shallow. There was no personal motivation, no personal driving force for her to undertake the task like she did and the character does not change. She is the same when the movie ends as she was when the movie began. She doesn't learn or unlearn anything and this was a letdown. Let's compare to the other solo movies for the original avengers. Tony in Iron Man had to deal with the fact that his own weapons were being used for war and destruction mostly among innocent people, Steve Rogers in Captain America was all about standing up against bullies, Thor learnt how to be noble and worthy and even Bruce in the Incredible Hulk had to learn to control the monster inside which he did by the end of the movie. Then we have Black Widow, who ends up being the same as she was in the other previous movies.The next problem I had with this movie is the antagonist. The main antagonist is barely existent save for the third act. They say a movie is as good as its villain. Well, we don't see the villain until late in the film. This is detrimental as there is no sense of conflict in the movie. They attempt to fit in a lot of interaction between the hero and the villain in their brief encounter towards the end but it doesn't make up for his absence throughout the entire film. There is however, Taskmaster. I hear this villain has a lot of depth in the comics and is widely criticized for being disappointing in this film. I am not well familiar with the Taskmaster in the comics, so for me, I felt like she was a tool to keep the plot moving. Its like a programmed robot chasing our main characters around. It's a spectacle to see the fight scenes involving the Taskmaster, but that is it. She adds nothing else to the movie and actually doesn't even cause any real damage. She had no development at all and therefore I ended up not caring.Another issue I had with the film is that in lacked some originality. To me, the final battle was too similar to the final battle of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Even the relationship between Steve and Bucky in Captain America was too similar to Natasha and Antonia in Black Widow. Not only the final scene but the entire movie gave the Winter Soldier vibes and that is not all good despite The Winter Soldier being one of the best marvel movies. I felt like this movie didn't have an identity to stand on its own."
1709,9,"Not Endgame, but a nice backstory to a character! People want to complain about certain things in the movie, sure! There are things I had to scratch my head at... but in my opinion the action was great, you saw a story in Natasha's life. While people want to complain about bad CGI or certain acting... it happens sometimes, but this film kept me on the edge if my seat... It's not endgame. Keep that in mind. It's a characters story to provide background to decisions made in later films (as far as chronological timeline goes). I thought there was more action in this movie than other marvel movies I've seen in the past."
1710,2,"Worst Marvel Movie Ever We love Marvel movies and have seen them all and this was the worst one ever.Too much talking and backstory and not enough action. A few action sequences were not enough to save it.It was a real disappointment to us, to the point that we considered leaving the theater."
1711,9,"The I am completely shocked by the many negative reviews and many of their points are unfounded and basically dumb. Now I'll be honest, I wasn't super excited about this film as Natasha was never my favourite (purely for lack of screen time), and she's dead so what does it matter? Turns out it matters a lot. Black Widow is a great return to marvel movies after a two year hiatus and is exciting and engaging throughout the whole two and a half hours. Scarlett Johansson is still incredible as Natasha, but the show gets stolen by Florence Pugh's Yelena. The relationship between the two sisters is one of the many joys of this movie and Yelena's witty sarcastic comments provide hilarious breaks between the action and more heavy themes of the movie. An hugely entertaining movie for the entire 2 and a half hours, it definitely stands out as one of the best solo films to date. Don't listen to the reviews calling it overly feminist- just because a movie has women in it doesn't mean that it's pandering to any agenda. Just because there are powerful women doesn't mean it's tokenistic or over the top. You would never second guess this movie if it was largely men, so why is it an issue when it's women?This movie is incredibly entertaining and a great edition to the MCU. Definitely a must watch for any marvel fan."
1712,5,"Meh A mediocre film. Good acting, excellent musical score but a weak script and weak direction, with fighting scenes damaged by too many editing cuts. The pacing is not very good, there's a 15 to 20 minutes mid section when they only talk, and the dialogs are rather boring. Also, Russian ""accents"" are ridiculous, they should have employed Russian actors instead of Barbour and Weisz, that family would never speak English to each other while in Russia, they were not pretending to be an American family anymore."
1713,6,"Average Marvel movie with slightly better action that the rest Even excluding my bias for DC and how they make every movie it's own style, Black Widow is just like the rest of the Marvel movies except this one is probably one of the most forgettable next to 2008's Incredible Hulk.Spoilers:The movie straight up ruined the Taskmaster character from what I read about him in comics, it shouldn't be that hard to write a simple character.The movies plot as a whole is all over the place, like how did he get this technology to control all these women? Etc.Most importantly this movie came out 10 years too late after the Black Widow character has been degraded in the MCU as a meaning of fan service.To sum it up, this movie is basically an average Marvel movie, not the worst I have seen, but not the best either."
1714,4,"A Big Meh A this point superhero movies need to find something unique to go on (which is much easier said than done) because it's becoming really formulaic. Personally, it was a Marvel movie which you could swap the name with another and no one would know, there wasn't much uniqueness to. The CGI in my opinion was badly done, looked choppy and rushed. The characters were all female, not a single man other than David Harbour who in my opinion portrayed a Russian the best out of them all but whose onoy role was a comic relief character and not an actual standalone hero or villain to fight. I get they want to empower women and all that but this isn't how you do it. In all honesty, they are laughing at women in my opinion because if you need a movie with only all women to empower them then this is not representative of real life. If we get a movie of all women then men should get one too. The whole ending seemed like a way to shove the whole ""liberate yourselves women"" in people's face, it's just so blatant and unsubtle it makes you cringe. I'm a woman and I was rolling my eyes at these scenes. Scarlet Johansen didn't even seem like the main character of this movie tbh. Also, lack of action, I was getting bored. I felt like I saw a drama instead of a fantasy superhero movie. It was entertaining nonetheless, but not worth the hype at all in my opinion, as it has nothing unqiue or memorable about it and the one thing you watch these movies for, the action, isn't even really there."
1715,9,"Exciting, emotional and deep. The Black Widow film was presented with pure taste. Natasha Romanoff confronted her past and revisit the family that she spent time growing up with. Together, they achieved the mission that fixed her broken relationships.In a full circle, Natasha demonstrated a solid recipe for this Marvel film. This film is long overdue! Although the ""Black Widow"" did not have superpowers, she is a highly trained assassin with bad ass bracelets (Widows Bite) that can stun enemies.The after credit was long, like super long. But don't miss the post-credits scene."
1716,1,marvel or bollywood What happen to marvel? Why they nade such a things? Is it from marvel or bollywood? Seriously !!!!
1717,2,"Slow, boring and I expected more. For those hoping to see a history of Black Widow and how she came into being, there is none shown. We start off with young Natasha and then soon jump to 21 years later to show you events after Captain America Civil War. In the meantime, secretary Ross of has a few failed attempts at hunting down Romanoff. For the romantics hoping to understand how Barton and Natasha got so close and why things didn't work out, this movie offers no explanation whatsoever. If you like mindless dialogue with a horrible Russian accent and a movie so boring that even its explosions won't cause you to blink an eyelid, you might enjoy it for its occasional chuckles but this is not a movie worth watching many times unlike the other Marvel movies."
1718,1,"Generic/Boring I was waiting for the end, the scenes were so basic. Doesn't compare to the other marvel movies at all, so lame. I wish it wasn't so generic and bland."
1719,10,Good movie Pugh shown through Really enjoyed this movie. The childhood storyline really got to me & is sadly something kids today deal with in several countries. Scarlet did great & I loved her chemistry with Pugh! Pugh seriously impressed me! She fit the role so well & was very believable. The masks definitely felt like a nod to mission impossible. Overall worth watching.. giving it a 10 vs a 9 to try to balance out some of the 1* ratings that this film deserves better than.
1720,6,"6.5* I had low expectations as MCU movies have become pretty generic aside from a few standouts post-phase one. My biggest complaint is the humor. Anytime there's an emotional foothold in Black Widow, it gets cut short with a witty comment from another character, thus ruining what should be engaging. Another negative is the weak villain(s). Taskmaster is turned into a victim. If the writers weren't obligated to tell fans the long-awaited story behind Budapest, the character and story probably would've gone a different direction and for the better. The main villains motive is lazily written too. My last big complaint is the action. It's pretty lazy and unappealing for the most part. The editing in these scenes is also pretty bad. Now, onto the positives.The biggest positive is act one. The opening sequence is great attention grabber. The entirety of act one also felt more serious than an MCU movie. It was refreshing and great to experience. Another positive is Florence Pugh. I personally enjoyed her more than Scarlett. The final major positive is that it did a good job at balancing the scenes with action and without action.Overall, Black Widow is alright. It's another movie that'll get lost in the oversaturated genre of comic book movies. As for the MCU, it's probably one of the weaker entries into the franchise."
1721,10,"Fantastic movie This is what we mean when we say we want a female superhero movie that's well written. This movie did everything Captain Marvel didn't even though we already know this character. My only complaint is that it should've been released between Captain America Civil War and Avengers Infinity War, but it was still amazing with stellar performances from every person in the film."
1722,8,Much better than usual hollyood trash Much better than expected. Some good funny scenes. Alot plot twists. Its basically ridiculous fun and not a dull moment. The acting is acceptable. CGI is acceptable. Amd the dialogue is not bad. Worth watching once.
1723,6,"A mediocre script that's a decade too late and poorly directed saved only by the cast Title basically says it all. This has to be the worst directing in an MCU movie yet. I bet there were 2,000 quick cuts by the end of the film it made it hard to interrupt the action scenes which is half the fun of a Marvel movie.Like some have said the attempt at humor is over the top and used wayyy too often. It should be a 3 to 1 split not a 50:50 split as far as dry jokes and sarcasm goes.This movie just felt like it was a decade too late. Fans had been asking for this movie since the first Avengers film essentially. It would have been better if we got a blackwidow and Hawkeye back in 2012-2015.But I do understand this movie was needed to fully introduce our new Blackwidow and to shoe her in and we got a good one, FP is absolutely perfect for the role which takes me to the only real positive, the cast.The cast carried this movie on their back's 110%. From Scar-jo to Rachel Weisz to David Harbour and especially Florence Pugh. If this movie didn't have such a solid cast it would not have been worth the price of admission.So definitely a bottom tier MCU movie. The shows on Disney+ right now blow this out of the water which is a shame because Scarlett J has paid her dues for years to earn this movie and this is how she's repaid."
1724,2,10 years too damn late Is it better than Captain Marvel? Absolutely but that's as far as I can go when it comes to praise for this pile of DOG SH! T that might have been ok as a phase 1 movie.... In fact we were asking for a Black Widow movie back then but nope we had Iron Man 2 the rushed mini avengers movie and the 2nd box office flop in the MCU after the 1st flop in the franchise The Incredible Hulk and even that film is better than this junk.Is the movie ok? Yeah if your drunk.
1725,8,"Finally it's here Honestly this movie was equal to what my expectations were. I think that Black Widow is rated lower than I would think since people had massive expectations, after waiting a LONG time. But if Black Widow came out when it was supposed to, (in may 2020) then it would be rated higher on IMDb.Firstly it has very good action and is super action packed. The story line is good, but could have been better. The characters are ok, but some people such as the villain had no background story whatsoever. The acting is really good, especially the sister and dad who are super funny and amazing in the action sequences. Good comedy, good effects, and ok drama.Overall this is a great movie, that I would recommend."
1726,6,Fast and Furious Did anybody else feel like watching Fast and Furious but instead of Letty it was Natasha?
1727,2,"Awful, Disappointing This has to be one of the worst Marvel movies. I'm gonna go into spoilers near the end but I will issue a warning beforehand. First off, the good. This movie starts very well. One of the best for a Marvel film, though I think Civil War or Winter Soldier is the best for Marvel opening scenes. The acting is pretty good, especially Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson, who are both excellent. The relationship between Natasha and her sister is written quite well... and that's where my positivity ends. Every other aspect of this movie is so bad that I'm truly surprised. Time for spoilers.The story for this movie has to be straight up one of the worst for any superhero film ever. The idea is that there's an antidote that can snap Black Widows back to reality if they inhale it. This is ridiculous. 20+ years of conditioning can all be undone by inhaling a weird red gas? Natasha has to stop the guy who is the head of the Black Widow program and free all of the Black Widows. Oh boy. How utterly boring.I could forgive the bad plot of the action was good but it's not. It's not even mediocre. The action is some of the worst I've seen. It's so shakey and choppy and even the choreography is lazy and boring. The best fight is between Natasha and her sister as it has the best choreography, but it doesn't make up for the god awful editing.The worst thing about the movie is how there is zero tension. We know Black Widow can't die because this takes place before Endgame, so we never feel like she's in danger. Although they could have at least tried! Show her struggling to get up with cuts and bruises after a bad fall or something. Instead she does things that would kill any human being and walks off without a scratch. Because of this she feels invincible throughout the whole movie and it becomes hard to feel anything for her.Lastly, the villain. Taskmaster is, without question, the worst villain in any MCU film. For one she (that's right, I said she) never speaks. You know how Taskmaster is egotistical and prideful? Not on this one. Here, she's mute. They also made her a girl for no reason. Like, it makes sense in the context of the story why she's a girl, but the story is already terrible so whatever. A better plot would have written an interesting villain instead of gender swapping the character and giving a half assed emotional arc to her.Captain America: Winter Soldier is a better Black Widow movie than this. I'm so disappointed in this movie. I wish there was a good, female-lead superhero film, but maybe there never will be. At least I can always go back to Atomic Blonde."
1728,4,"Some strong beats but ultimately a disappointment I've been eagerly awaiting a Black Widow movie since Paramount picked up the rights before the MCU even existed.While the first half of the movie has some strong beats and hits the mark in some ways, the second half of the movie really goes off the rails. What should have been a very grounded spy thriller forgets what it is and becomes a superhero film.The cast is excellent, but the story just doesn't feel like it was crafted by people that understood the character. Very disappointing."
1729,8,"I absolutely do not get the hate. I see a bunch of really weird reviews out there. One guy even gave it one star and writes ""I'm not used to marvel movies"". Then why trash them?First of I'm a dude and really REALLY liked this one. I gave it a solid 8. But in full disclosure I'm not comparing this to movies like the Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather or Jurassic Park. Those are all completely different categories. I am rating this based on all Marvel movies I've seen and I absolutely loved this one. Florence Pugh did an absolutely amazing job and is funny as hell!!! David Harbour, the super hero with a dad-bod is absolutely hilarious.I noticed during the pandemic a lot of armchair critics starting firing up their computers in their mom's basements and decided it would be a good idea to trash fantastic movies. Let me tell you this: This one is ACTUALLY good and solid entertainment!"
1730,7,"Better than expected I was entertained. I know a lot of people will take issue with how Taskmaster is portrayed and underused, but still I enjoyed the movie."
1731,5,"Mediocre at best Basically obligated to watch it being sucked into the mcu; but if this phase 4, mcu is plummeting down a cliff then. This was so mediocre and had such glaring plot holes I'm quite surprised marvel even allowed it to be released with their brand on it."
1732,1,"I am not use to Marvel movies, what an experience Someone can explain to me why in this movie, the car windows who are being destroyed during an action scene become instantly fixed the scene just after (it happen at least 3 or 4 times during the movie, perhaps a deal with the car brand - BMW).And why the mother of Black Widow looks like she have the same age than her daughter ?And why all the aspect of the scenario like the red gaz who fix everything instantly, or the pheromons of the bad guy who works with an unaturally acuracy and characters emotions are so simplist ? This world with it strange gravity rules is really hard to believe excepted if I was still a 5 years old kid."
1733,8,TASKMASTER This gender changing has to stop. Stick to the originals or create your own thing. This is a serious f up. Stop changing genders and race of the original comic book characters!!
1734,4,You and your feminist friends can enjoy underwhelming movie ! How many men starred in the movies like outside the male Prison !!Forced feminism.. reeks throughout the movie's plot.If you weren't a fan of forced feminism in infinity wars which was only towards the last battle for a couple of seconds this whole movie is just an expansion of that mentality.I think it's disgusting and it doesn't discuss anything that's important.If female suppression and female empowerment is the codex of the movie.Then it does it cheaply and without taste.The fight scenes try to borrow from the Jason Bourne movies but it does it poorly.There's barely a serious fight in all the action packed scenes.Dreykov has no security in one of the most secret and secure places in the world.The architect and scientists of the facility are all one in the same.I don't want to waste my time writing about the movie for a moment longer.Spoiler Plus what's up with the CGI when Yelena blows up the engine of the craft it deviates from all the other special effects.
1735,8,"Black Widow definitely deserved her own movie! I don't get the disappointment from the other reviews, Black Widow was never intended to be an Ironman movie or a Captain America movie. It's the the backstory we always wanted to know about this truly interesting character. The different characters introduced during the movie were also quite interesting as well, I definitely felt the bond was there between them. Marvel you're truly the only consistent cinematic universe out there please keep it going so high!"
1736,5,"It is like the gi joe movie Worse marvel movie ever... as simple as that...the falcon and the winter soldier miniserie (worse miniserie in mcu) it is connected with this movie to introduce the hawkeye miniserie, thats it..."
1737,4,"Excellent, sharp fighting scenes, overall mediocre by MCU standards Scarlett delivers another excellent portrayal of this marvel character. However, the over-the-top action, and one liners have a bit of a slap-stick kinda feel without being funny. Story line is kinda weak, as well as how everything played out. Red Guardian busts through the prison doors, but remained captive all that time before doesn't make sense. The feminist imagery, messaging is beyond annoying, trite, and takes away from the movie. Weak outing for MCU considering how good their recent tv series has been and are being received by fans."
1738,8,"Black Widow pros and cons Black Widow movie review: Some spoilersPros: The new characters! Not only does everyone already love Natasha aka the Black Widow but the Marvel Universe brought in a new cast to love, specifically Yelena (Pugh) and Alexei (Harbour). These new characters brought out not only their own fun and strength but depth in Natasha's character as well. Definite scene stealers!The depth of the film. This movie touches on Natasha's childhood and a brief history of the Black Widows and how they are basically all human trafficked. You get a glimpse of the industry of girls trafficked and the abuse that goes on. It makes Natasha's story a lot more impactful, it wasn't only her that was sterilized and suffered a lot of pain.Great directing and action scenes! The director of this film did a great job, she captured a perfect combination of action, depth, sadness, intensity, lightness and humor. There are some scenes where the fighting and aftermath of the fight scenes is more realistic but yet some moments so huge it could never be realistic! Congrats to a job well done.Cons: Villains. The villain of this film is not captivating whatsoever. With comic book movies today the villain needs to be just as interesting half the time as the hero. In this case, it's not. You are more interested in the main characters by far. They needed a more personal touch to the villain and the impact on Natasha.Some violence was brutal. The fight scenes can be extremely violent and sometimes it's not really for any important reason. It would have been better if they saved extreme fight scenes for the important scenes. It would have been more meaningful.No cameos. If you were hoping for a big Marvel character cameo you will be disappointed. This movie takes place during Captain America Civil War and Avengers Infinity War when the Avengers are going through a rough patch, so we know they are off doing their own thing. Natasha does mention them being her family though.8/10."
1739,2,"I'm Avenging my money back A shame , not sure what I was watching. The only Marvel part of the the movie was the opening sequence ."
1740,6,"Shoulda/Coulda been so much more.... 1st; must confess I'm a BIG Black Widow fan from the comics and animated shows. I even enjoyed her minor roles in the MCU/Avenger movies. Now this movie was just OK and glad I didn't waste time going into theater just used Disney+. Script so-so; action scenes so-so; acting just so-so. So why the ""six"".... I'm bias and will miss Black Widow, lol."
1741,4,Mediocre and bland. Worst Marvel movie so far. Characters are shallow. Obvious plot. Too much CGI.
1742,1,"Lazy script The trailer of this movie was very cleverly made, like a click bait. Probably the trailer contain all the good scenes of the whole movie. Yes, it's bad one even compared to other MCU movies.The script seems to be made in total lazyness, based on couple of lines. It's like story should start at a point and end at another point. Just mix some dialogues and special effects in the middle. Which is hugely disappointing for any MCU movie, and the first black widow movie as well.Villian is a big let down, but when the whole movie is bs, there's not much to criticize. Florence Pugh shines, hopefully she'll get better script in future."
1743,10,Good not great I enjoyed this movie overall although I will say I think that it should have focused more on Black widow and less on her sister.
1744,6,"Average action movie! I enjoyed it, specially the first half, but just as an average movie, not as a Marvel's superhero movie."
1745,7,"David Barbour was great Everything else was fine. Decent action scenes and not too much cgi, which is a big plus these days. I dug the over all story and the unique family aspect for a marvel action movie. That was nice to make it a unique enough feel. I also liked all the women leads."
1746,8,"Got what we came for. First off, Task Master didn't need re-imagined like this. The character started strong and interesting and then just plopped before the reveal.Other than that, the movie delivered comic book action with humor and hyper activity. I loved the avalanche scene in the theater and laughed at most of the interaction between sisters. I was actually glad this movie was not as dire and intense as CA:Civil War and forgave most of the dialogue. However...When Natasha was smashing her face to thwart the pheromones, she didn't need to monologue her intention and give the bad guy a chance to retort suddenly. That just lost it for me and felt pointlessly out of place to her character and the adventure up to that point.I suppose the fight between the Red Gusrdian and Task Master was a let down, he is this super strong super solider yet he just stumbled through their fight? Was that a dig at Russia perhaps? Who knows besides the writers, but it was another plop in the plot.All things considered, we got what we came for and felt the movie was fun and theater worthy. In compariosn to other MCU movies, End Game was more of a frustating divergence than BW, so I can't dig this movie too much."
1747,8,?? Why are there so many poor reviews for this movie? I thought it was lovely.
1748,10,"who run the world? girls Out of all marvel movies (and i've seen all of them multiple times) this one is my favorite, it's so empowering and it's the first female oriented, family oriented marvel movie. It was a heartwarming experience and i would want all the young girls to see this movie. Usual marvel quality, soundtrack was surprisingly good. Florence and scarlet had an amazing bond which really made the experience better, more personal and emotional. Honestly nothing but good words.Ps. I cried a lot."
1749,6,"Just About Bearable But Really It's Just Meh! Black WidowOh dear what a shame and I was so looking forward to this. The script was beyond clunky, and we just had periods of slow weird dialogue that just rambled whilst the characters scored points of each other, and this was meant to be humour. These periods were juxtaposed with action sequences that were just CGI fun-fests, totally unbelievable action.The whole movie was a total ""clam jam"" from start to finish and this artificial one sided gender balanced female empowerment sentiment always result in male bashing, with any man in movie being portrayed as an idiot, superfluous, inferior, evil or a misogynist. They tried this before in that ""turkey"" Captain Marvel that majorly flopped!The major and overwhelming problem is Natasha Romanov has no superhero powers so her on screen presence is limited when you compare her to Dr Strange.There were a few redeeming point, Florence Pugh was good but her accent was all over the place, from Kamchatka to the Urals, and David Harbour as Alexie was a fabulous screen presence who dominated his scenes and was fully committed to the project despite some dreadful lines.Overall it's a weak 6 out of 10, meaning go and see it but don't expect much, indeed I started to fidget!"
1750,10,Action packed women power For me personally I think it's the best marvel film to date. Was action packed the whole ride through. I think the characters are more relatable than most super heros. Strong female roles I think Hollywood needs a lot more of this. The whole theater audience seemed to love it as well. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I think the whole group of writers cast and direction did very well. I will buy this film for my personal collection. A+ all the way!
1751,9,"Scarlet will be missed! A good movie, shame it took so long to get Scarlet top billing, great on screen charisma. A fantastic performance in respect she knew her character was deceased. However, the best scenes are stolen by the Red Guardian, even though he plays the clichéd Homer Simpson character that middle aged men get saddled with today.Go see it, fun popcorn movie!"
1752,5,"It Just Wasn't Good. Sorry. I wanted this movie to be good - but it just wasn't. I've been a Marvel fan since the 1970s - and I've seen all their movies like 5 times each.You know what this movie was? It was Captain America: Winter Soldier - except with chicks. Captain America, replaced by Black Widow. Bucky, replaced by Black Widow's sister Yelena. That's it. The End. The parallel's in the movie make you wanna' gag.On top of all that, there really isn't any good action until around 1 hour and 45 min into the movie. - and the movie is 2 hours and 15 min long. So do the math. The rest of the time is spent with back story of how Black Widow had it hard growing up,... bad parents,... blah blah blah. Yawn.I wanted to like it. I did. I just wasn't good.5 Stars is generous."
1753,1,"Makes Thor the Dark World Oscar worthy! I'm still in shock, after all the delays and the wait, this is what the fuss was about! Absolute rubbish! Worst Marvel movie so far! Pointless! Movie is too long, boring and treats you like an idiot! Don't get me started on the accents. Just don't expect the Marvel magic you've come to expect."
1754,3,Disappointed!! I thought it is an origin story of Natasha Romanoff Aka Black Window. But I am disappointed by the storyline.. Didn't expected this poor storyline.
1755,8,Not bad This movie probably gets a low rating from all the MCU nerds.
1756,9,Solid episode Solid episode in the Marvel's Universe. Don't forget to watch all the credits.+ Natasha's family relations + You feel shadow of the Soviet Union + Multiple nice fight scenes.
1757,9,"Just another great Marvel movie This movie filled in important gaps in the timeline, plot holes I hadn't even noticed until they were already cleared up. This manifest family working together is truly another touching gem from Feige & Co. But seriously, Comtessa Allegra Valentina De Fontaine? Why."
1758,1,"Boring garbage Boring action, boring story, boring characters, boring moviedont waste your money or time, its really a bad movie that you just want to end after the first 30 minutes. I sat through it and regretted it even more waiting for something original or good to happen.Trust me go watch something else. Anything just not this garbage."
1759,7,Give me more Yelena Florance Pugh is sooo amazing. All 4 of them are very good on their roles.
1760,8,"You know pretty good better than I thought Overall better than I thought not the best movie but what do you expect in out of black widow. Men but when you think about it it's pretty funny it's a movie about family dramas and if you can attach some type of drama or feeling with family or belonging I think this film will be better than you think. It's pretty good you know and the guy from stranger things definitely lost some weight. Overall not a bad watch, better than you think you could watch it in the theaters if you can I don't know this movie wasn't made because it wouldn't sell toys but Scarlett Johansson could probably sell me on a bunch of stuff like I like ghost in the shell but not really but you know lost in translation Scarlett Johansson it's a good time."
1761,9,"I guess I'm one of very few that feels that Black Widow is one of the best marvel films made! Black Widow has everything I'd want from the genre, I'm shocked that it's getting so much hate and star struck that so many times people in the audience went in and out during pivotal scenes! I absolutely love the cast they're extraordinary and great actors throughout. It was such a blessing to see a marvel film in the theater especially in IMAX plus since Covid they delayed the release a million times better than watching at home on Disney plus. A hilarious thought I had was Taskmaster riding up in a 64 lol! I hope my thoughts get seen by many cause the movie is quite enjoyable for what it is!"
1762,8,"I LIKE IT I really enjoyed the movie, you get to know what happened to her after captain America: civil war and you get to know another side of the black widow... I don't get the hate."
1763,3,"Was this a Marvel movie? They could have taken it even further and make the dad also a woman, the only man should have been the bad guy!!!"
1764,4,"Boring: surfeit of explosions and clichés, little Black Widow in it To put this opinion in context, I must clarify that I'm not a Marvel fan, and not always in the mood for superhero movies. But ok, the Black Widow sounded a bit different, like she did not get some superpowers accidentally. She's supposed to be trained and dangerous...and Scarlett Johansson is an actress that I like, so I decided to watch. But what a waste of time.The script is weak and with many flaws. They don't know how to flesh out the characters or provide a thrilling story...that is, the little story that we get to see because for the most part the film is CGI action scenes and explosions. And the Black Widow doesn't feel as the protagonist of her own movie, just a passerby. There is not much insight or development about her character. She pouts and cries a lot, but where is the dangerous avenger? Another one who's pouting all the time is Rachel Weisz..she's a great actress, what did they do to her? They could also enter a competition for the most forgettable villain. It is also tiring the need for inserting the superhero team in every movie. Aren't there any other ideas? They had an interesting story, a charismatic hero and good actors, but nothing good came out of it...so much potential wasted."
1765,10,"Worth the wait Unlike WW1984, Black Widow was worth waiting for. The villain was villainous, but the family dynamic was what carried the story between explosions. Great performances by all concerned."
1766,3,"Lots of Action but little else I loved the idea of Black Widow. But the Storyline just didn't work for me. The Action was great, and in this Scarlett Johansson was terrific. Unfortunate that the Plot was unclear at times."
1767,4,"The Catwoman-movie of our generation Cartoonish characters with no depth and no development. Too much time spent on trying to have emotional parts, which fail miserably. The attempt at humor had potential, but constantly falls flat. Constant flaws to take you out of any well-wanted emergence, like inconsistent Russian accents across characters and family members."
1768,3,"Leftovers The movie felt like it was put together with spare parts and bits, including the script .It just seems like they took what they had lying around , called in the C-team, and had them hammer out some kind of Marvel flick .Which is true for many Marvel movies, but here they didn't even try to make it look pretty , or pretend to care .Story, filming, editing , CGI, cast, all straight out the bottom drawer and onto the screen .I have a soft spot for Scarlett Johansson, probably watched all the movies with her, but even I noticed early on in her career that she just can't act ; sadly , she wasn't even the worst actor in this .3/10 for not being the worst movie in the genre, but also not being rewatchable, mediocre at best, and being an obvious money grab ."
1769,6,"Ok Waiting 2 years for a marvel film and coming from end game. It had big shoes to fill, and tbh it didn't fill them. It felt a bit boring (before i knew it i was vacuuming the carpet and not even watching 😅) and lack of consequence (although this may be end games fault) .In the past I haven't minded character changing from the comics to fit in with diversity , but Taskmaster isn't really a character, they are just there for a shock reveal.Came out disappointed but this may be end games fault, it was just too good 😅"
1770,5,"Not terrible but not what fans wanted. As a stand alone film the movie is not terrible but marvel was more worried about setting up the new phase instead of giving the fans what they wanted. The fans wanted you to pay tribute to a woman that went from spy, to team member to team leader. A woman we all come to live over the years and a woman that gave her life for our hero's to win. Instead she was a side kick in her own move and we as fan were disappointed."
1771,6,"Average I've seen every marvel movie in the cinemas and was literally bouncing off my seat waiting for it to start. Was also so thrilled for the movie to have a female director, finally! But let me tell you, in all honesty I was so disappointed with this movie, and this is coming from someone who was anxiously waiting for a Black Widow movie. The action scenes were way too forced and tremendously exaggerated, and on top of that the CGI is just meh. The plot is so predictable and sloppy, very flat storytelling."
1772,6,"Enjoyed the first 20-30 minutes.... Yeah Let me start by saying that I LOVE Black Widow, and she deserved to be in a stand-alone movie. And when it was announced after Endgame, I groan. (I always state Endgame is the last MCU project I was going to watch... and look at that, I lied.) But, I loved her in any movie she was in, and when it was her time to shine, it was suitable for about 20-30 minutes, and I loved the first act, then... yeah. Both Florence Puch and David Harbour were outstanding as Red Guardian and Yelena Belova, respectively, and heck, they stole the spotlight from Natasha more in her solo film. And of course, Scarlett Johannson was, in fact, Black Widow, and she knocked it out of the park. And the chemistry between Johansson and Puch was perfect and felt like a REAL sister relationship. And sadly, that was just it... that was all that I liked about this film. So, this is entirely down for me cause I wanted to like this film.I didn't like most of what I saw, and the reason is that they tried to do so much, but it came out so diminutive, and the way they deliver some plot twist, something similar to Iron Man 3. When Natasha finds out that Dreykovs (the main villain) daughter, who she thought she killed, earlier in the film was indeed the Taskmaster, the way it was delivered and handled was poorly done, let alone that they are again robbing the actual Taskmaster. I know who the Taskmaster is, and the way the MCU showed this again is so stupid and embarrassing it was honestly disappointing. The CGI was also noticeable; for instance, a man was on the jet that Natasha's family was in, and it looked so fake!! And the ending, how did she escape from General Ross? Again, that doesn't make any sense of how she escaped from him and the army. I thought she would escape with her family, and then she would later meet with Rogers, Wilson, and more. But that doesn't happen. Overall the movie was okay, and It had some good moments but nothing special again from the MCU. I feel like I needed more and needed a proper send-off to Natasha since we aren't probably going to see her anymore. And yet, they plan on putting more sequels and spin-offs from this film. Sad, I wished I loved this film, but I don't. 6/10."
1773,8,A strong romanoff action in first half 15 minutes in and i was so emotional and pumped up...only marvel can do that ...and then there was insane action...natasha was always one of my favourites ...and her journey was so painful even in bits in other marvel movies ....that i wanted to watch her journey from childhood...i loved action sequences so much ...but 2nd half movie was so rushing....villan wasn't givem proper chance and kind of frlt that natsha was side kicked in her own movie...
1774,3,Started strong Then half way into the movie came to a screeching halt and crashed into disappointment.
1775,5,"Total Waste I had big hopes for this one. I mean this is a character who can fight fight fight.. but in the movie this character like talk talk talk.CGI was a mess. Story is solid and good, but action scenes are pretty bad.In first time, Taskmaster was very amusing, at last he/her was just a waste of time.Third act wasn't good at all.Music and costumes are really good, otherwise its a mess."
1776,8,"Nice movie which gives Natasha the spotlight. I liked this movie. It was loaded with action and reminded me a lot of The Winter Soldier, my favorite Marvel film. The chemistry between Scartlett Johansen and Florence Pugh was great.The film moved slowly at first, but Black Widow never had a proper origin story in the Marvel movies, so taken the time to know her character, was necessary. It's too bad we won't get to see more of her character in follow up movies, but I do believe Florence Pugh as Yelena will be perfect as the new Black Widow. She was amazing in this movie.The family dynamic between Yelena, Natasha, Alexi, and Melina was also very good. I did very much enjoy the twist towards the end which made use of technology used by Natasha in Winter Soldier. I would have loved to see more of these four team up, but alas it will never happen, and that is too bad.Overall, a very good movie, which is a lead in for Marvel to bring more woman superhero's into this phase 4 of the Marvel Universe.I tried to be spoiler free, but just to be safe for those who haven't seen all the marvel movies, I will add spoiler In case I said something that might be consider sort of spoilerish."
1777,5,"Neither a 1 nor a 10 - it's just average Binary reviews abound these days. Too many reviewers think that if the film they're watching isn't the best film ever then it must be the worst. This film occupies neither end of the scale. Yes it's all action, the plot is aimed at the brain-dead, the script is all too predictably formulaic, the effects are very cgi heavy and it's unlikely to ever win any awards for anything. It's a superhero movie and they all follow the same pattern so you ought to know what to expect. It's certainly not the best superhero movie ever and it's equally not the worst. It occupies that glut of movies in the middle that are adequate to pass a couple of hours with but you'll be unlikely to ever care enough to watch it twice. It actually has more a feel of an old Bond movie seeing as the titular heroine has no actual superpowers and the villain would look equally at home in a dormant volcano stroking his cat.When a movie is this average it's hard to actually find things to praise or hate."
1778,6,"Meh! This honestly was mediocre at best. The humour was forced and not that good and don't get me started on the action. Purely fantastical, it doesn't even make any sense."
1779,8,"Natasha Romanov signing off FLorEncE pUgH cArRieD tHIs mo... Sthu. She was a nice surprise who did as good as others and she was able to because the writers gave her a character which they will milk for foreseeable future.Now on to the review.When I heard they're making black widow movie I thought it would be a proper send off to Natasha Romanov since they didn't do that in Endgame and gave 90% spotlight to the Diva that is Tony Stark. He wouldn't have those stones if not for her sacrifice. But then they made this movie which was lazy as hell but I was excited for Taskmaster. And then, after release people on the internet spoiled it for me. I knew the entire story before I watched this.Now despite everything I still liked this movie to give it an 8/10. First of all, one of the best looking marvel movie. Ragnork is on top of that list. Action is good, but bit too many cuts. Background score, specially Taskmaster's theme was pretty epic. CGI was rough towards the end but mostly it was great.Coming to the story, I liked the plot. They were doing so good setting up the challenges unfortunately the solutions which they apply they messed up. Bit of lazy writing there. Yes Taskmaster is different from comic but it was fine for me. They shouldn't have included that character in this kind of movie. But they did and utilized best they could.Anyway, I am not going to cry like a little boy because they didn't do justice to comics. As a movie this was great. It was less of a Black Widow send off and more of a Yelena setup. I had hoped Barton would be there in a Black Widow movie but they don't have to do what I expected. I am matured enough to watch a movie not based on what I wanted but whether what they have given is great and entertaining or not."
1780,5,"Scarlett Johansson I saw the movie and as many others said in their comments it was not what I was expecting. Yet, what I loved must about this movie was Scarlett Johansson smile. I love it when she smiles!"
1781,10,"Brilliant. Personal bias will always bring out strong opinions and I would defend to the death the rights of the naysayers to leave their subjectivity low ratings. That said, for me, I thought the movie was wonderfully poignant and it filled just the right amount of backstory to make it tie in to the franchise without loss of continuity. I also loved the casting, the screenplay and the use of humour to humanise the 'superhero' aspect of the tie in movies. Brilliant."
1782,1,"Disappointing! I don't even know where to begin. This has so much potential, but it was such a huge let down. Taskmaster was ruined and Blackwidow just fell flat. Marvel should've quit whilst it was ahead."
1783,2,"What a waste I was so looking forward to seeing this film, expected an awesome end story for a brilliant character. What we got was a CGI-heavy bag of nonsense, this was oh so near to being a franchise ender. The Black Widow character deserved a lot better treatment that what she got in this monstrosity. The post-credit scene was the best part! Hang your heads in shame - this was a stinker 😡"
1784,6,"Average As the perspective is everything in reviewing movies I should explain myself from MCU movies, I'm an 80% MCU fan and 20% DCU fan, on the other hand, I'm a 60% DC characters fan and 40% Marvel characters fan, and of course ""Black Widow"" isn't in my top 10 favorite Marvel characters list -which is doesn't really exist but if I did it someday I'd never put Black Widow in it- So you should know that I'm not the number one Black Widow fan and so does the majority of people because she has never been introduced as a main character on the silver screen before.So if this was not an MCU movie, I wouldn't watch itBut let put that beside and let's talk cinema.The action was lousy, and I blame whoever put Cate Shortland in this project, she has never made action movies before and that's her first time to be on a blockbuster movie, and unfortunately, she failed to give us a single good action sequence.There's a scene, Scarlett Johansson's stunt double face is fully clear and much more stupid things.Editing was trying to hide the actresses' laziness and the director's lack of experience by fast cutting the scenes to hide stunt doubles faces but that made the action sequences experience even worse, I almost had a headache.The movie's CGI is cheap, it really can harm your eyes, in 2021 and they did that how come? Hands down it's one of the worst.I saw a lot of people talking about Florence Pugh's performance, and that surprised me, not if she was bad or something but you guys saw better performance than David Harbour's? He stole the show He's the best thing in the movie, his comedy scenes killed me, honestly without him I'd rate the movie 4/10 Scarlett Johansson's performance is Scarlett doing Black Widow, not Scarlett doing Nicole from ""Marriage Story"": A lot of superhero poses and 0% effort of doing action scenes without a stunt double.Rachel Weisz's performance was just meh.In any movie -especially a superhero one- I'd love to see a good villain like Thanos or Loki and so on.In this movie, I saw a bad-written one, he has absolutely no motive for his actions, I know he's a metaphor for masculinity and how a lot of men shutting females' mouths and control their actions, but the metaphor wasn't enough, I wished for more, I wished for a better character with real motive.In the end, it's not a bad movie, but it shall have been a better one."
1785,9,"worth for money I understand the disappointment from fans who expected that full Taskmaster story, but do not think it means that this movie was a flop. Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. In a word it is worth for money for me."
1786,1,"Insane Taskmaster is a woman? Really? GTFO. Holy cow, they can ruin everything.STOP WITH THIS NONSENSE! Please stop. Stop ruining 70yo characters to please the woke mob, it really gets old quickly."
1787,6,"Action Hero Movie With No Tie-Ins With The Avengers Universe There are no super hero powers in this movie (except strength but isn't really used). This is your basic 007/Bourne Identity movie and doesn't add anything to the Avengers universe (beside the after credit scene).The writers spent so much time on developing a relationship with Black Widows family that they forgot to do anything for a setup for the bad guys. The ""evil"" bad guy performs like 3 actions (scenes) in the whole movie and the ""evil"" organization he is running does nothing bad (just trying to recover a serum). All other build up for how bad he/they are is just dialogue which this movie spends a lot of time using."
1788,8,"Humor, hard-hitting action, and heart IN A NUTSHELL: This newest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe features Natasha Romanoff in her quests between the films Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. It's an interesting backstory mixed with spy capers, a dysfunctional family comedy, and some hard-hitting action. The superhero action flick is directed by a woman, Cate Shortland.THINGS I LIKED: I'm so happy for Scarlett Johansson for finally getting her own feature film. This movie fleshes out her character with an interesting backstory that makes for an entertaining and touching solo Avenger movie. Unfortunately, this will probably be her last one since her character has already died in the MCU died in the story arc!Florence Pugh is stellar in this movie as Scarlett Johansson's sister! She has been putting out some great work lately and has an incredibly bright future. She has the athleticism, beauty, and fierceness to be an excellent Yelena. I'm such a fan. The subtleties in her facial expressions and Russian accent made her the true acting standout in this movie. She's also the one who has the most connected relationships with the other characters in the story and brings real heart to the movie. Her character has a full arc demonstrating her toughness and vulnerability. She should definitely be added to the MCU.David Harbour is absolutely fantastic and one of the highlights of the movie. I love his endearing obsession with Captain America. I get it. I do too. One of my favorite scenes of his is when he's in a room having a heart-to-heart with Yelena (Florence Pugh's character).There are quite a few action sequences and entertaining moments I can't wait to see again already.When is Rachel Weisz going to start aging? She looks great.Great cat fight scene between the sisters, but the Taskmaster fight sequences were electric. Taskmaster's presence instantly darkened the tone and made it feel like a superhero movie. Kudos to the stunt team because the sequences hit HARD.The opening credits are striking and kind of different for a Marvel movie.I thought the ""Avengers posing"" conversation between the sisters was pretty funny.Sweet firefly moments. They're so magical.The comedic banter works most of the time.There are a few Easter eggs for true Marvel fans.Some critics have pointed out that Natasha spends Act 1 hiding. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that was appropriate since actual black widow spiders do the same. Then, when the prey is in sight, they pounce and kill.So many Russian braids. Ha ha It has the elements of a spy movie with double-crosses and alliances, making some film critics call it a Marvel version of a James Bond movie.As with all Marvel movies, keep watching after the final rolling credits for another clip, a fun cameo, and an intriguing teaser!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: There are a LOT of quiet, talking moments. Some of them are touching but because of them, Act 3 feels rushed.The CGI and stunt doubles are often very noticeable.It's so sad that there wasn't a Stan Lee moment in this Marvel movie.I would have loved an even stronger Russian influence.It takes about 40 minutes to set up the actual plot.There are several times when you'll laugh and say, ""Come on!"" when certain people miraculously survive ridiculously deadly moments.The actual villain doesn't show up for a very long time. He's disappointingly bland.TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some profanity.Gross conversation about a forced hysterectomy Lots of destruction Violence with only a tiny bit of blood even though it's brutal.Some subtitles when Russian is spoken.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"
1789,8,"Good movie for kids and teenagers who love marvel superheros From a teenager who grew up with superhero's and loves them, this movie really was good, action scene were good they really showed what black widow and yelena were capable of. I've always wanted a black widow movie because she was the first female marvel superhero I saw in movies and this movie didn't disappoint me. I'm not a ""professional movie rater"" but coming from me a teenager who grew up with superhero's I really loved this movie."
1790,8,"It was good......but Natasha deserved a good funeral, like TonyNatasha's funeral was all good until Valentina arrived snorting her nose, that was absolutely unnecessary."
1791,6,"Not the best, Watchable !!! It's really really a great feeling to see Natasha on the screen again for the last time and undoubtedly she deserved this. Had it been released in 2014 or before timeline, the entire setup and rage for black widow would've been way higher. Keeping this aside, I won't say it is one of MCU""s best, but I enjoyed BW barring few hiccups in the middle with patchy cgi in couple of scenes. CGI part could've been lot better in the last act as it spoiled the real fun. Grounded fight sequences would've made this one more effective, as we are pretty aware of BW's strengths.Scarlet is Black widow and she served it right all these years being an avenger and seeing her in action again for the last time is really different feeling. I don't know about others but whenever she is in action mode with her "" kickass pose "" , it gave me good vibes and when Yelena uttered "" you're a poser"" I was like...yeah she is and we love it when she does it. Of course Jo excelled in her role as usual, i wanted more of Natasha stuff here as it is the last movie but fine, kind of satisfied. Young Nat protecting her little sister Yelena in the beginning is indeed a beautiful scene. Loved jo and Florence bonding , such a delight !!!Florence Pugh got a great debut in MCU , she literally grabbed the opportunity and showcased her talent with her fierce performance and attitude as Yelena, loved her. One of the finest additions to the MCU, no doubt and I'm pumped up to see her in future marvel projects . LET'S PROTECT YELENA AND KATE BISHOP (Hailee) <3Lovely Rachel Weisz, good to see her and did her part as Melina along with David as red guardian. Expected a lot with taskmaster part but it is a letdown. Over all, Nat - yelena show all the way and it is a good ride. That post credit scene though , intriguing ;)Final bid adieu to NATASHA ROMANOFF AKA BLACK WIDOW <3 love."
1792,6,"Don't watch if you're expecting to see Taskmaster Taskmaster was the main reason I was excited for this movie. Too bad what you saw in the trailer is all you get of such an awesome character. Maybe 5 minutes of screen time, and they barely scratch the surface of his potential. Also, a lot of this movie just drags on for no reason. Not a terrible film, but not at the standard of what you'd expect."
1793,1,"Feminist garbage Another generic Marvel film filled with absolute mundane action scenes, no character building and cut scenes of CGI explosions. Also all the bad guys are female ? Seriously? Where is Jordan Peterson when you need him. Are you telling me all the most highly trained bad guys sent to take down the black widow are female.....See it if your easily entertained by the spin off marvel movies, otherwise skip it."
1794,8,"Good movie for non comic experts Overall the action sequence and the whole movie is shot brilliantly. With small details along the movie explaining why and how black widow changed from civil war to infinity war. Though critism comes from comic book inaccuracy because of the way the characters are depicted, it is a good journey between two sisters. However audience might get tired of it's jokes, we do have to remember that most marvel movies/tv shows are pandered to children and young adults."
1795,3,"Really bad movie. This film is totally useless. It's so boring, the bad guy is just a mess. Don't lose your time watching this movie."
1796,1,"My precious 133 min is wasted! Terrible acting, terrible plot and real waste of time."
1797,1,"Russian culture deserves more. Much more This movie is absolutely disappointing, disgusting and disrespectful to a great and rich Russian culture! Shame on Marvel, you just appropriated our culture without any respect to our nation!!"
1798,2,"UTTERLY POINTLESS AND BORING Black Widow is a terribly made, utterly ridiculous, pointless, CGI fest with occasionally some good moments in it.The film has a promising and a tense opening finally giving us an insight into Natasha's past and her background and then it opens again with some credits and music and takes another 10-15 minutes to actually kickstart it's story and plot.The screenwriters never really settle on a particular thread and keep juggling different ideas and story beats resulting in a mess of a film.The action is cartoonish and quite pathetic. Natasha a spy, a normal human falls off a three storey bulding and hits her head twice on some pipes and gets back up immediately without a scratch.The actors do their part but the script is haywire and there seems to be a lack of creativity from the people who helmed it , everything just comes across as mundane and flat.The villain, well....... Taskmaster shows up occasionally. The film tries to tie Natasha and the villain's stories together but it is done in such an odd haphazard way that ultimately it leaves you feeling frustrated instead of emotionally capturing you.The movie is genuinely uninteresting and is an abysmal send off for one of the most beloved MCU characters and Actors. The editing is fine , the cinematography is bland, the music is forgettable.David Harbour and Florence Pugh may be the only positives in this film along with Scarlett's presence, all three of them have a genuinely good chemistry which does bring a few laughs and emotions from our side.The film has a weird and twisted morality and a clear and obvious undertone which it didn't need and quite frankly leaves a sick taste in your mouth.Don't waste Your time with this , go watch Winter Soldier instead."
1799,5,"Strong acting , Must watch The movie was phenomenal. I love Black Widow as a character. I liked this better than Wonder Woman. That's saying something. This is now my favorite movie. Of all time. Go 👏🏼see👏🏼it.Here's the answers I got:1. They explain Budapest2. WE SEE WANDA'S VISION and UNDERSTAND IT it's not what you think 😱 I gasped out loud3. We solidify the Red Room backstory and ""Black Widow"" title. We accept the ""family"" and ""sister"". Yelena really is a Black Widow, just not in a way that was predictable. She had big shoes to fill for the franchise after Nat; but her secret is that she doesn't even want to fill them. What a cool way to introduce a character without it being forced like I thought it."
1800,7,"7.5 give it a chance Is this the best marvel film...no. Is it however a perfectly good and enjoyable film that can't quite match the hype of titles that preceded it...yes. Part spy thriller part bonkers action film it does a good job of merging the too. Performances are great throughout with perhaps certain supporting cast members outshining the titular character at times. It gives you a back story,some action and if u watch the post credits a hint at what's to come. Watching the film already knowing how it ends for black widow does take something away from the film but isn't detrimental enough to stop it being fully enjoyable. The fight sequences are very good and adequate airtime given to other characters,the only real exception being taskmaster who I felt could have been utilised better. Overall a very entertaining film and a nice farewell to character we have spent the last decade with. Don't believe the haters but equally don't expect an endgame level experience. A solid contribution to an amazing universe."
1801,5,"Michael Bay would have been proud This movie felt like it was directed by Michael Bay. It has the same quality as the Transformer movies. So if you like that you'll probably also love Black Widow.However to anyone who just sees special effects as special effects and would rather have a plot that ties together, this is not for you.There is too much action, many of the fights or action sequences feels like they were written by 2, 16 year olds.Almost everything is over the top and a lot of things doesn't make any sense but it fits this particular scene.Spoiler: When they destroy an engine on the airship everything just starts exploding. Sparks are flying from every electrical component on that airship and random areas just start to explode. I get that it makes a great visual scene but it doesn't achieve anything else other than cement this as a generic Hollywood film, unfortunately."
1802,3,"And Just like that it diminished impact of HYDRA and ruined Taskmaster This was movie was straight up joke from Marvel. Movie was never about Natasha Romanoff; instead it was about Yelena. They should've developed Natasha's character more. I was hoping to see Natasha's rigorous training to become a widow; How she eventually left Red Room; How she joined Shield and became close to Nick Fury; What exactly happened in Budapest and how her relationship with Clint developed. Literally none of the questions were answered. That red magical mist was absurd. They never showed how it was developed and who made it. Its just there.Viallins were joke. They did dirty to Taskmaster with its lame reveal. They made him or should I say her a mute robot. Lastly, this movie ends up saying Red Room and its deadley Widows have always been most powerful behind the scenes secret organisation and they carried out several coups and power changes. Like What?? Then what about HYDRA. It was established in Captain America WS that the HYDRA is biggest secret agency thats ruining the world but now suddenly introduction of Red Room destorys importance of HYDRA.Imho this movie should've been a Disney+ show and Loki should've been movie."
1803,4,"What a let down I'll be blunt: this movie was awful. I love the character and I feel there aren't enough female superheroes and female superhero movies so I was really excited for this movie. However, the story lacked depth. It was like a Marvel version of Fast and Furious and not the good ones. If you like lots of action with no thought you'll love this movie. It was boring, predictable and at times simply didn't make any sense. It's almost like they wanted to rush this through because of the delay from Covid19.I wouldn't waste my time on this and really, Marvel, are you trying to one up D. C. with who can make the worst movie?"
1804,4,"A movie we deserve but don't need Since her appearance in iron man 2, i wished for a standalone black widow film and was wondering why MCU doesn't make a black widow film. Rumors say that feige was interested but Disney didn't give approval. Some say that it developed after wonder woman's success. We got it but unfortunately our lead is dead in the main timeline. Last year, it was one of my most anticipated films. But slowly, I started feeling that MCU won't be great like before after endgame and black widow proves it right.These are the drawbacks of black widow 1. Timeline: This film would have some impact if it was released after civil war and the post credit scene shown in it could have been added in endgame.2. Taskmaster: taskmaster is heard to be an iconic marvel villain who can easily copy anyone's fighting skills. Taskmaster's addition in black widow made us excited but it turns into a sore thumb like Mandarin in iron man 3 and nick fury's eye in captain marvel. A twist is revealed in order to evoke some sympathy like winter soldier but unlike bucky who we knew very well in first avenger, and due to that we sympathised with him. On the other hand, we don't know anything much about the taskmaster character in order to sympathise with her.3. Villain: Its obvious that mcu lacks strong villains and black widow continues that tradition.4. Main character: we have seen in some films were the supporting characters score over the main character and save the film. It happens either because of the actor's limitations or the character. Here natasha romanoff was overshadowed by her sister Yelena belova not just in acting but also in saving the day. Scarlett Johansson is a great actress but her character is boring. No wonder she wasn't given a solo film before.5. Action sequences: Why, i was previously anticipating for black widow was because i expected it to have brilliant hand to hand combat mcu film after winter soldier. But black widow doesn't have any great or memorable action sequences.6. No entertainment: Black widow doesn't have any entertainment because of its dark concept. Even winter soldier and civil war had dark themes but where thrilling and entertaining but black widow lacks any thrill or entertainment.On the whole, black widow is a disappointing standalone film. Florence pugh and david harbour are the only saving grace who provide us the mcu entertainment."
1805,6,"You WILL hear terrible accents and you SHALL LIKE IT! Those super FORCED TERRIBLE Russian accents ruined this otherwise decent movie for me. Half way through it came to the point where anytime any of those ""Russians"" even opened their mouths before saying any word, I almost starting yelling SHUT UP! I KNOW YOU ARE NOT RUSSIAN, don't try to pretend otherwise. You can see actual average Russians on youtube with MUCH BETTER and believable accent when they speak English AND they actually look like Russians unlike these very obvious Americans who didn't look Russians from any angle and on top of that, ONE thing that could make them believable (accent), they were TERRIBLE at that.Once again, FFS! SHUT UP AND DON'T TRY TO PRETEND YOU ARE RUSSIANS...."
1806,7,"Solid MCU movie. I enjoyed this movie. The action scenes were some of the best since Winter Soldier. Great performances by Pugh and Johansson. The film score is also one of the best out of all MCU films. Classical music enthusiasts will recognize Shostakovich inspiration in it as they listen.My biggest hang ups are that the writing of the movies continue to 1) shoehorn comedy in when it isn't necessary, and 2) weaken villains and make them less commanding. Red Raider was annoying as the attempted comic relief to no fault of the actor. I found his character irredeemable based on just how annoying and tone deaf he was written. Also, Taskmaster (while very intimidating at first) ended up being a shell of its comic counterpart. Comic book buffs are likely not gonna be very happy with it.All said, this movie exceeded my expectations. However, those were kinda low to begin with. Giving it a solid 7/10."
1807,10,best Best and interesting. I like this movie don't no others.
1808,9,"Great way to go out. This answered the questions I had about Black Widow's back story. Had a lot of action, and introduced some characters I want to see more of. I can't wait for the Hawkeye series."
1809,8,"I don't get the hate? I watched this last night and I really enjoyed it. I loved seeing Nat back. I loved the story and what happened to her after Civil War. I am really going to miss her moving forward! The pace was good. I had tears at the end.Sit back, grab the popcorn and enjoy the first Marvel film in what feels like a lifetime!"
1810,8,"family It's 1995 Ohio. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), and their 'daughters' Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova are a Russian sleeper cell working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone). 21 years later after the events of Civil War, Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run. She goes for a safe house in Budapest where she runs into Yelena (Florence Pugh).The good part of this movie is introducing the 'family' into the Marvel universe. They are a surprisingly fun group. I was not expecting comedy. As for the plot, it's a standard James Bond plot. It's fine. It's able to fill in some of Natasha's history. It crosses a few items off the Marvel checklist. It could be better. It's obvious that the family is coming back in future Marvel stuff and that has good potential. I'm still not a fan of bringing Elaine into the Marvel world but that's a different rant altogether."
1811,5,"Predictable So disappointing. Almost all is bad in this film, also the CGI. A sloppy plot, flat characters, useless villain, all of that have been tried to be lifted by the actions scenes which were way too exaggerated. A good start bad a very poor ending. With that kind of budget they could have come up with something better."
1812,7,"Enjoyable Black Widow has been sitting on the back burner for 18 months now because of Covid-19 and is one of the first big block busters to be released since we have opened up .Was it worth the wait ?I think so .Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger.As per usual with Marvel films , I would have enjoyed this much more if it was shorter.This would have benefited from at least half an hour shaved off of it .Having said that I found enjoyable.The story and timeline are nice and easy to follow and the action is non stop apart from a family reunion half way through the film which was actually a nice rest bite.Rachel Weisz and David Harbour are really good as the adopted parents but I wasn't in any way convinced about Florence Pugh .She just didn't seem right for the role .Like most Marvel films you have to stay to the end of the credits to see a clue as to what's next and I'd quite happily sit through a follow up to Black Widow ."
1813,8,"Dysfunction 'R Us - Natasha's history and Family reunion This is not a standard non-stop action, paper-thin Avengers movie. It is the origin story of Natasha Romanov and is all about family. It begins with the (surrogate) family that Natasha never (temporarily) had and progresses through interactions with them all and the defeat of archvillain Dreykov (Ray Winstone), an excellent enemy and the puppeteer behind many other enemies. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) Red Guardian, and her father, is excellent as comic relief and a major part of the active and reunited family and storyline. Yelena Belova, (Florence Pugh), is her sister and they do seem to resemble one another and interact as siblings. Antonia Dreykov, (Olga Kurylenko) Taskmaster, Commander of the Red Room is a killer villain and behind a mask most of the time. Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), her mother, fulfills the part wonderfully including telling her not to slouch and raising some cute, controlled pigs named after her husband. Other than the pacing being a little slow at times I liked this movie and recommend it. I raised it to an 8 after writing the review."
1814,9,"Take a breath All y'all need to calm down! This is an origin story. Compared to the origin movie(s) of Captain America, or Hulk, even Thor; Black Widow is above par! The first movie is always a little bumpy but thoroughly enjoyable. Plus they dared to touch on some deeper over arching themes of child exploitation and family dynamics. All I'm hearing is ""we wanted the exact comics.""Puhlease... grow up."
1815,10,After 2 years .. finally It was awesome watch after 2 years ... could've been better.
1816,6,"Reversed sexism? As a movie, it does quite well the first 30-40 minutes or so, i feel the James Bond theme but a bit less raw. Maybe also a bit like the Bourne movies.And the Alexei characters has me intrigued from start.But then the script becomes way to obvious and sloppy that makes me lose interest.Also the characters does not really progress whatsoever, there is not much to learn about their backgrounds or future to come.And for the reversed sexism regarding the male characters, its truly downgrading.So we have following according to this movie: You are either a exagerated macho ideal selfish kind of brute, like a orch picked out of the world of warcraft movie.Or You are over-sensitive kind of sissy that does everything to please a woman.And then you have the woman hating psycopathic villain.I know women have gotten to play this mindless characters troughout the ages in movies. But just reversing it, what good does that to, in the year of 2021. Have we not gotten further?"
1817,6,"Wasn't boring Why does the family have a Russian accent? I get that we're not going to subtitle an MCU movie, even if all the characters are Russian and have zero reason to speak English beyond nostalgia.What happened to their mid western accents? These are all deep cover operatives placed in the USA. Did we forget the beginning of this movie? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills."
1818,6,6/10 6/10. Good but could've been better. Not marvels best film but not a bad watch.
1819,9,Good end to a loved hero I'm really not sure why people are giving it 1 or 2 stars.. it was really good but there were parts I thought the CGI was lacking and a little clunky. People can't expect this to be comic accurate as this is to fill in the gap in the MCU storyline. All the cast played there parts very well and Scarlet was great. I'd encourage anyone who has watched it yet to give it a go. Definitely worth a watch.
1820,5,"Not a total disaster but also not a good movie I think all of us were sincerely hyped for this movie. This movie had a potential to be one of the best movies marvel that marvel could ever made but unfortunately they just couldn't make it.the best thing about this movie was Florence pugh she was literally great in this role and i love her sarcasm and joler while she is badass. The worst about this movie was the story of it. The characters development was also a mess! I kind of got some feminism vibe ( hating man) from this movie because this movie only had three men in it. One of them was nothing only a supporter to natasha. Second one was the re guardian! If you ever read the comics you would probably know that he is so powerful but they made him a total clown in this movie. And the third was the villain of this movie they also made him so powerless in this movie. They also changed the origin of Taskmaster he was a man born with the power! But instead day made him a woman and changed the whole story, i mean that's fine by me if they only make him a woman but still is stick to the origin of the character from original story. This movie had a great potential to be one of the best Marvel's movie but instead they ruined it. What are the best thing about this movie was the cast of this movie. Scarlett Johansson ans Florence pugh were amazing! I loved the whole chemical from them diva perfectly casted David Harbour also played a good act. Also so the end of the movie was cool and and it hyped me again for or next movies."
1821,9,Amazing Finally this film is here! Everything about this film from start to finish is brilliant. It is filled with enough one liners to make it funny while the rest is just pure action! Every fight scene is choreographed and performed to perfection. The acting is on point for each actor and the rest of the widow family was cast incredibly well. The plot was great. But the music! Marvel always have amazing soundtracks and this is no different! Every piece of music was incredible! Only reason this film isn't a ten is because I would've loved to see some more taskmaster.
1822,5,"Generic Action Flick Not bad but also not memorable. Good action throughout most of it. I found the character building was hit or miss. The dad and younger sister are funny but everyone else I could care less for.Back story was your dark childhood cliche and the bad guy was lame as hell. The way it all ended was just sloppy and frankly, too easy. Here we had a dude who had control of many things in the world but his entire enterprise is destroyed by breaking a single propeller.... come on... that was a criminal mastermind? /sigh....As a plain action flick it was fine so if you are just looking for mindless butt kicking then this will satisfy. But dont expect any more than that."
1823,8,"Decent Marvel movie not the best but not the worst I can't believe all those bad reviews from embittered people that maybe didn't have a happy childhood, sure wasn't a great movie but was fun from the beginning til the end, get your popcorn ready."
1824,8,"People are hating on this unnecessarily while this is easily one of the top five Marvel IPs Films like this recieving negative reviews is the very reason why production houses don't invest in female-centric movies and instead, push woke films.This isn't a Ghostbusters or Ocean's reboot but a genuine attempt at telling a good story, with a woman in the front. The woman part comes later, a good story comes first.You wanted to watch a commentary on the Cold War? Watch an actual documentary, or read a book, this is, was, and will be meant for entertainment. The viewer has to understand that Marvel Studios is now trying to please three generations of movie watchers - children, to reel in for selling merchandise; teens, for future films; and adults, who simply won't stop crying and complaining about everything.Iron Man, Captain America IS GONE! Come to terms with it!Speaking of the movie itself - phase IV is really off to a great start. Gone is the forceful, out-of-place humour MCU was criticised for. This film has some genuine moments filled with grief, and joy alike. Also, this film takes the final film of phase I, and flips it on its head, which is a very brave storytelling technique. Come on! Give it a shot, and don't go in with unrealistic expectations, and you'll come out with a few good laughs, genuine tears, and a well-spent time. Isn't that what films are for?"
1825,5,"OH DIRE, OH DIRE, OH DIRE Which is kinda wrong because the films isn't all bad. The action is,,,,well,,its cut n paste from all the other cut n paste Marvel superhero films. But its the storyline, puns, one liners, obscure casting thats just so,,,dire! Ok the storyline starts off quite logically for a ""Marvel sidestep and pick up on another character development/ milk the franchise even more"" plot. There's the predictability of good against bad. But somewhere in this Covid dictated film, i'm reckoning, the original actors couldn't make it, nor the director, nor the screen writer, because you can actually see where the producer went ""oh hell,,,phone up whats his face, he'll do it"" as the film goes spiralling into someone else's dream reality! The one liners !!,,,oh my god if Tony Stark was a real person,,,and he wasn't dead (or is he?),,he'd be sueing the film makers for copy write on his character trait! Ray Winstons russian accent,,,well it just isn't ! The ""family reunion"" scene is by far, the biggest clue that, taking unprescribed drugs whilst making a film, is NOT a good idea! It's so far out their,,,it'll probably end up with its on reality tv show! I actually got extremely angry, the first attempt at a watching this ""film"", because it just confused the s*** gotta me,,,i had to walk away before i plucked my own eyes out! Second attempt (and some calm me down drugs), i made it to the action packed/completely implausible/yet predictable end. Watching this film is like, eating a well known burger,,,it looks sooo good in the adverts, even the wrapper is inviting,,,but when you start chomping into it,,,its just the same old minced up meat, with little or no valuable contents, but it'll do till you get a proper meal."
1826,7,It was good but then again a prequel of inbetween The story was good but then again they messed-up of when the story was staged after civil war and infinity war and now they are proceeding with younger sister to take on Hawkeye?That is just like bringing Dom's brother FF9 out of nowhere just for the story to continue.
1827,8,enjoyable Action packed movie with good back story of black widow. I admit it could have been better but this movie is worth watching. All casts performance is good. The flow of the whole movie and the action sequence are great. Go watch it.
1828,6,"Not quite what she really deserves I keep thinking what this movie would turn into in the hands of Zack Snyder. I had exactly the same kind of feeling when I watched the first Justice League movie. I figured out why I felt like that after I watched the second one. Instead of following a broken hero's journey, due to poor story telling and character development, one should bear not so good jokes and ok visual effects. With such a resourceful story and talented cast, so much can be done. What a waste."
1829,8,"This is a very well done movie that deserves a lot of credit. Black Widow (2021) is a movie we watched in theatres opening weekend. The storyline surrounds Black Widow during the Civil War where she takes a hiatus to regroup with her sister and support a mission that they are both pursuing. They decide to break their father out of jail who happens to know the location of the villain's lair. As they work together it quickly becomes apparent why there is so much resentment for each other within the family and why a happy ending isn't likely. This movie is directed by Cate Shortland (Lore) and stars Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Rachel Weisz (The Fountain), William Hurt (A History of Violence), Florence Pugh (Little Women) and David Harbour (The Stranger Things). The family dynamic in this made for an impressive storyline way better than I anticipated. There is a dark cloud over the family the entire movie and doubt if they will ever overcome it...and the conclusion to that element of the movie was very well put together. The action was top notch as always and the CGI and battle scenes were fantastic. The cast delivered their characters perfectly. They were very well selected and the chemistry and acting throughout was excellent, as was the writing and dialogue. This is a very well done movie that deserves a lot of credit. I would score this a 8-8.5/10."
1830,8,"Great... It's a beautiful film, I love the air battle... Don't want to say much but it's very great, watched twice already."
1831,4,"BELOW MY ALREADY NONE EXISTENT EXPECTATIONS This film is what you expect from too much hype with a Disney budget, nothing memorable about it."
1832,6,Dozed off while watching it Watched it on Display+ instead theater and dozed off in couch for not sure how long before woken up naturally. It's not that bad... just very flat and forgettable.
1833,7,"Pugh and Harbour were amazing. Yelena managed to make her way into the list of favourite characters within a single movie. Alexei was hilarious. Natasha on the other hand felt kind of boring. The number one thing I didn't like about the movie though, is Taskmaster. I feel like they COMPLETELY got rid of the charm Taskmaster has always had, I feel like it was a complete waste of a great character."
1834,2,"Action a bit intense at certain point, but ruin by too much talking, and annoying overuse scene! Another big letdown! This film start with a girl ""Natasha"" playing with her sister ""Yelena"" at the playground, and they eating together with another two people(Alexei, and Melina) scene! As turnout, this film is about a villain ""Dreykov"" need to take revenge on Natasha for the death of his daughter! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the eating scene, and overuse of the flashbacks scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have things broken, and explosion at certain point, but overall have slow motion, low satisfaction, and occur in too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Natasha defeat the manipulated mercenary ""Antonia""! Still have a post credit scene! Valentina telling Yelena, Hawkeye killed Natasha at the grave! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
1835,4,Disappointed.. It started good in the beginning and I started to excite that it's gonna be a bang. But that last one hour is so boring that felt to stop watching. Action in good in the beginning but climax action is like a junk video clips added together.
1836,1,Bad.. Just bad... The worst avengers movie I ever saw... The action is meh.. No deepness in the actors.. Just plain events.. After 1h I was wondering when it would end.
1837,5,"Same mistakes over and over... The story would shine in the good old days. It's so old school, so shallow, that it tells nothing about anything.It reeks of misguided woke. Men are stupid, fat and arrogant. The widows were recruited in Russia, where the black population is 1/2000. Take a look and count how many black (really black) widows there were. And again, warriors are all women. The great scientist is a woman. But the tyrant is a man. Please... too obvious.You can't think of anything new? You had to take the taskmaster and give it to a little lost russian girl... Really? So many and powerful russian female heroes. Have you read the story about the forbidden zone?What saves this? Ironically, boobs and asses, cat fights and some nice faces. Sad, just sad...You can do better, but it will take you a long time..."
1838,5,"A little disappointing This movie had a lot of action packed events but some of them were unnecessary. I don't think it was worth to make a whole movie about a dead avenger. But I'll give marvel this, there explosions were pretty cool."
1839,1,"Overhyped boring mess This movie had been so publicized that it was a long time coming. And that it was essential viewing for the MCU movie fan etc. Man they couldnt have been more wrong . Long and drawn out , and somewhat confusing , this movie has lots of action, unfortunately its still lousy because it does nothing to add to the MCU universe. The black widow is a disjointed mess of overblown action scenes and extremely boring dramatic sequences of the characters just droning on and on and it just go nowhere. The after credits scene is also such a cliche. With the black widows sister being shown Hawkeyes picture by an operative to go after him since as the operative put it ,hawkeye was responsible for her death which is total BS. As we all know the black widow committed suicide so hawkeye could get the soul stone . I hate movies that are lousy but the Scarlett J fans will no doubt plunk down money just to see her in tight outfits - who cares that the movie stinks. She could be reading a candy bar label on screen and her fans would pay to see it ."
1840,5,"Boring More talk and less action. Turned it off after an hour. If you're a Marvel groupie, you'll probably love it, but I could not get into it."
1841,1,"Can Disney not afford writers? So epically flawed.Does science not exist?Is physics not a thing?Is logic not real?An indestructible human who can fall ten stories...Try jumping off a ten story building, really, try it. You'll find that if you're human, which this character is, you'd be dead, or at least wish you were dead.A movie for people with peanut brains.200 million dollars, that was money well spent :)"
1842,5,Disappointing Not as Good as most of Marvel other films. Such a shame.
1843,10,"Don't listen to the bad reviews This movie was 10x better than the avengers by a long shot. I'd say maybe even as good as the Ironman movies! And I'd say don't walk into this movie thinking that marvel would do anything different. This is basically the same story line and plot of all there others and still the tame violence with little blood. The real reason that this was a 10/10 was the actresses and actors in the movie! Their performances where spot on! Expecailly Florence Pugh's! The only thing is you have to remember to wait because the after credits are crazy!! But don't let any of the bad reviews stop you from going, make your own decisions!!!!!!"
1844,4,"Lots of Potential, Poor Execution Ok, I get it, Feminist and Minority propaganda in movies are the new Marvel initiative, but the casting in this movie wasn't the best. There's better female actors out there that could've done a much better job. The movie gets really slow toward the middle, at which point I fell asleep in the theater. Marvel movies used to be exciting, but lately they've been more political than anything. Other than the best parts toward the end, the movie dragged on and didn't really capture my attention like the older Marvel movies."
1845,5,"Pugh and end credits is the only good thing Florence Pugh carried this film. This was the Marvel equivalent of The Rise Of Skywalker- large buildup, excitement in the fandom, and God-awful execution. The post Credits scene was the only redeeming factor of this film. Whereas people expected the cocky, taunting Taskmaster, they instead got a gender swapped buffoon pretending to be a formidable opponent. Don't get me wrong- I have no problem with the gender swapping ( I love Tilda Swindon as The Ancient One) , I only have a problem when it fails to fulfill hype, or a storyline. To be blunt, I honestly was more pleased with the Taskmaster from the Marvel's Avengers Video Game.Now, this is a SPOILER I do love the fact that they integrated Clint Barton. I look forward to this fight in the upcoming Hawkeye series.OVERALL I was fairly disappointed by this film. I would recommend it as an excuse for a date, but otherwise, just stay away from it, just like Thor the Dark World, this film sucks."
1846,9,"Thoroughly enjoyed Maybe my rating is a little high but, the movie did its job. It was entertaining. It brought more depth to the Black Widow character. My only complaint is I wish this movie would've been made during the last 10 years."
1847,10,"This was so good The movie is really good, i think it was a good farewell to the black widow, i liked the way how the movie focus on the black widow."
1848,6,"Loved Pugh Thought it was a good movie. Loved Florence Pugh's character and hope to see her more in the future. She definitely carried the movie with Yelena's personality, gas station hair flipping scene was great.If I'm being frank, I did find it a bit underwhelming that the daughter was TaskMaster - I felt TM could've been a lot more intimidating with a deeper reputation for future films, and having it tech-related, though arguably makes it more realistic, kind of took away from the skill of the character. It was a bit disappointing, but understandable."
1849,10,TOP OF THE LINE! Black Widow was Action Packed!! The Story About Natasha was BEAUTIFUL. This movie was worth $32 on Disney+! I Hope Marvel Release More Movies On Stream! I Will Pay For Good Action Marvel Movies On Disney+. I am Not Quite Ready For Theaters.
1850,8,"Why is everyone complaining? Is a good superhero movie, a good action movie , why everyone has to complain always?"
1851,5,"I was glad when it ended Black Widow should have been a compact, pithy film filled with her being a badass and a bit of interesting back story. Instead we got a rather ridiculous ""ode to BW/SJ"" which didn't really answer any questions about her past but made up a bunch of new stuff."
1852,3,Disappointed Too many CGI on the fight senses. Please explain to me?! How the hell black widow is able to stand and fight again after getting her booty kick by at least 8 women. Flip and hit by furniture! Yet she can do extra bad Beyond! When she DO NOT HAVE ANY SUPER POWER!! She is like Batman in Marvel universe! It like wtf? She is human being! Ugh! Super disappointed. Because I am expected more and better.
1853,10,"The wait is finally over . Scarlett Johansson is a remarkable Blackwidow I finally saw Blackwidow. Absolutely brilliant. All the mcu connections fit . 2016 civil war Natasha is on the run for the events of what went wrong with Steve and stark . And changing her hair color to avengers infinity war when thanos was coming for the infinity stones . I'm definitely gonna see this movie three timesthigis summer . And buy the 4K steelbook for my marvel collection, but hey it's great to see Blackwidow alive and well . But I'll remember her forever RIP Natasha Blackwidow Avengers endgame."
1854,6,I loved Jodie Comer in this Who would have thought that Killing Eve's Ace Assassin would make it's way to the big screen in the MCU? Jodie Comer was great as Florence Pugh.
1855,7,"It was ok I think this movie was ok. Basic Marvel Cinematic Universe stuff. Not good not bad. I was first thinking of not watching this because I a toxic person from indie wire told this was going to make me squeam. A combination of squirm and sqream I guess. Did neither. I laughed when I understood why a toxic person would say this was going to make me squeam. Loved the movie actually. 7/10 only because the movies humour felt a bit dry and it wasn't as good as an eight. Now Indiewire lost all credibility. If you can see my ratings I tend to give 8, 9 rarely and there have only been like one or two 10/10 movies. Now I'm just waiting for the ""Fine! I'll do it myself."" moment in this phase. I'm referring to the end credits scene with Thanos saying that."
1856,8,"Regular Joe here, I loved it This is why I don't read IMDb reviews anymore before I watch a movie. The ones with great reviews I usually end up hating. And the ones with awful reviews I end up loving. So I stopped reading them until after I watch a movie or show. I loved black widow. I know nothing about the avengers and all that stuff, so as an outsider with no expectations. I loved it and enjoyed watching it (my boyfriend made me watch if you're wondering why I watched in the first place). The story was empowering and reminded me of the very real human trafficking of women and girls happening in our world today. The co-star Pugh was definitely a scene stealer. I loved her character the most. Scarlett, Weisz, and Harbour were awesome. I gave 8 stars because I think it probably could of gave more, went a little more deeper but the movie is already 2 hours long so I understand why it couldn't have gone that way."
1857,9,"Family Matters MCU how I missed you. I've never been disappointed by Marvel's movies, some are certainly better than others but all serve a purpose in the grand story telling. Black Widow let's us proudly say goodbye and hello to wonderful and inspiring characters . Trust me you will very much enjoy your time with this family. The Black Widow is dead long live the Black Widow !"
1858,5,C movie Not good1- insult to taskmaster origin for his first live action Movie not a woman he could have interesting dialogues and the looks different he look like power ranger a robot is better2- the movie doesn't answer for what happened during infinity war and endgame3- no iron man.
1859,9,Not a movie an experience Okay so let's start by saying that I was sure that I was going to like this movie but what I didn't expect was so much fun the action here moved very quickly and fast even humor here its a full blown out experience.
1860,4,"worst scarlett's movie ever It's not hers fault, of course.Awful movie without any plot, dialogs... it was too long. It's not worth a penny, do not watch it in cinema!Great actors thrown under a train. Sad..."
1861,5,"Another movie with stupid storyline and great CGI All the negative reviewers are correct: this is really a movie with a dumb storyline which makes no sense at all. The girls are made of iron because they can endure evry punch and kick. Ever seen a boxing-match: one good punch and the opponent goes face down to the ground. Than the villain is hiding undetected in a city in the sky. Wow, the writers probably never heard of radar, spy-satellites and aircraft that fly fast at high altitudes. The special-effects and CGI are great but can not save the movie.If you like sf-movies better watch ""Tomorrow war"" which is a real masterpeace compared to this piec of crap called ""Black widow"" ...."
1862,9,"A must see for MCU fans!!! Went opening night with a friend to see this, and second time today. This movie put me on the edge of my seat! I adored it. Nice to finally have this movie after getting delayed constantly due to the global pandemic.Now, don't go in expecting this to be a big, Avengers scale. It's a prequel and a side adventure paying tribute to Black Widow after her death in Endgame. This entire film was a total spy thriller!! It didnt feel like your typical MCU superhero film and that's what I really dug about!! Great scenes and dialogue with the family!! And I'll say the family dynamic is the best part. Natasha has to deal with things that happened in her past before she was an Avenger and there is also a fantastic cover of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit in the prologue that really set the movie's tone. That's my reviewOne last thing, stay til after the end credits for an epic bonus."
1863,7,Nice action movie The movie is really well in the first half but in the second half it is not up to the mark than first half. Overall the movie is really fantastic.
1864,5,marvel should stop getting kicks out of this universe thing Marvel should stop getting kicks out of this universe thing and start focusing on making a good film with all their resources.
1865,6,"Had the potential to be more Black Widow is no different from most of the marvel films. It's filled with cliched characters, a completely expected twist, witty one-liners and a forgettable villain (perhaps the most forgettable villain in the MCU).Red Guardian character has no redeeming qualities of a father. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour are completely wasted. The over-the-top ending sequence is non-sensical. Taskmaster is an iconic hand-to-hand combat villain in Marvel comics. To see him this under-utilized is almost criminal. The twist that he was a she was something most people who paid attention could see coming since Olga Kurylenko's name is prominently featured in the title cards. If you're going to have a surprise twist, at least hide the actor's name in the opening credits.Formulaic. Disappointing. Forgettable."
1866,8,"Sadly she is not the main character in her own movie.... I'm only rating this an 8 because I really do love Black Widow and don't what to downgrade her movie score. But this was totally laid out for Yelena and her future movie or TV show. The whole movie centers around Yelena, Black widow is just the sidekick. I love Hopper who plays her dad, but I'm still utterly disappointed this wasn't really about her. I couldn't even cry when I saw her feel bad for a girl she thought she killed, because they didn't even bother giving her much of a back story for that. But they will definitely give Yelena one. So if you're a Black Widow fan don't get your hopes high for this. I'm very disappointed they wait this long to giver her a movie only to downgrade her character."
1867,9,"Black Widow This was a great film! Sure, it did have its very minimal flaws, but in my opinion, it had more pros. The one thing I really liked was the family dynamics in the movie. Even though non of them are related, they all acted like a family in the funny, dysfunctional way most families do. A great example of that was the scene where they were eating dinner together after reuniting, it was hilarious. I also liked the bantering sibling rivalry Natasha and Yelena had, that was also very funny and reminded me of how I act with my sibling. I also though the supporting cast in this movie was some of the best in the MCU. I loved hearing all of them with their Russian accents. David Harbor was hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing at his scenes, Rachel Weisz was also great, but Florence Pugh stole the show, she was amazing, I can't wait to see what her future holds in the MCU. Another pro this movie had was its action. It was amazing. The fight scenes we some of the best in the MCU. This is my personal opinion, but I liked how this followed Civil War, and ended before Infinity War. This movie did a great job filling the gap in Natasha's story between those movies. This movies was also unique in a way. Almost every Marvel movie has cool animated closing credits at the end of the movie before the credits role. This movie did not, instead they decided to do something that hasn't been done since The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 did it. They had opening credits. I had goosebumps watching the opening credits in this movie. It was so good, I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel movie, I felt like I was watching a war movie. The way they made it look so real was breathtaking, it was definitely one of the stronger points of the movie, it was also important to the story. The last thing I liked about this film was Ray Winstone's portrayal of Dreykov. The character is so truly evil, and the role was played to perfection. The one con to this movie was that it was a little slow, but other than that, it was great.All in all, I am just happy Marvel movies are back, but sadly, theaters aren't open in my area so I couldn't get the true experience. I don't know anything about Taskmaster, so I can't comment on why people hate what happened so much, but I thought Taskmaster was very cool. The Credit Scene in this movie was crazy, and sets up the Hawkeye show perfectly, I can't wait for that show, and I can't wait till Wednesday and the final part of the Marvelous week with Loki!"
1868,7,"A decent filler film with some good humour I waited to do this review after seeing the film for the second time and I am glad I did, I understood it better and enjoyed it far more.The film has an ok plot and plenty of action. It is funny in places and builds well towards the end. However some of the acting is quite poor, some of the characters a bit pointless and I am not sure if adds a lot to the marvel series.Sorry a watch though if you like marvel."
1869,5,So why ? This is just a regular action movie nothing more. I wondering why did marvel film this movie ? It wasn't necessary to watch.
1870,1,"What a STINK BURGER!!! First off, This movie was too long for what is was.The plots do not have a rewarding payoff, & or not explained. Example in most scenes you are dropped in the events that are happening, with little to no explanations of what is going on. I know less now about the back story of the avengers & or black widow now that I've seen this movie. The cut scene at the end one has to make a lot of assumptions in order for it to make sense."
1871,6,"Not what I expected! I didn't dislike this movie but I also didn't really like it. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed watching it and as a marvel fanboy I really do appreciate it as another MCU entry, but it just wasn't as good as it could and should have been. Florence Pugh carried this whole movie, she is hilarious and her character is by far the most interesting, I loved her dynamics and character growth throughout the movie and I just wish Natasha was as fleshed out as she was. The action in this is fantastic although a little CGI heavy but that's the whole movie really, way too much CGI and way too much boring dialogue. The red guardian is a really interesting character that really needed more back story and more screen time as David Harbour did a great job in this role. I just wish this movie had a little more time in the oven and did a little more work with the plot. Other than that I definitely appreciate it for what it is and it's another great MCU entry!"
1872,7,"I Really think that people forgot that this is Marvel film Two years since las marvel film and people starting to compare Marvel film with a Nolan Batman etc.Ok Black widow should be filmed after Civil war yeas but still is a good continuity film in MCU, dont know what you expected, its a good action and clear story, maybe lil bit rushed but give us everything win of Natasha and a closure, give it a break its not the best MCU film but definitely don't deserve sevens and fives."
1873,9,"Amazinf Movie, But Flawed Whilst Black Widow may not have been everyone's cup of tea, I personally enjoyed it alot when i watched it at the movies. It had a great plot, amazing characters, and FANTASTIC music!The problems i found with the movie was unfortunately 3 things. Villain, timing, and Yelena.I loved Yelena's character, don't get me wrong. But as a last tribute to Natasha, it was unfortunate that only a minor part of the plot felt like it was about her. Since this is (most likely) the last time we'll see Nat, it was quite irritating that this was the movie they chose to set up Yelena's future in the MCU.Now onto the villain: Taskmaster. Whilst taskmaster is an EXCELLENT choice for this movie, and personally one of my favorite villiana of all time, it felt not only odd, but also dumb that they genderswapped the character. I would MUCH rather have it that it turns out Dreykovs daughter ran the red room and wanted revenge on Nat, rather than her being a mindless puppet.Lastly is a small but unfortunate problem: The Timing! If this would have come out before infinity war, it would have felt so much more refreshing. Especially since it sets up the future and takes place after Civil War.But nonetheless it was an amzing action movie that i would recommend to anyone who's a fan of greatly coordinated fights, DOPE music and Black Widow herself!"
1874,8,"great action and just an amazing movie Yea the movie wasn't perfect. But i still loved it. Great performances from Pugh, Johansson, Harbour and Weiz. Emotional and funny as well. Although i loved pugh as yelena she outshined black widow. But overall one or the best movie of 2021 so far."
1875,10,"Don't listen to the haters. I honestly don't understand the reason this movie was so criticized, it is possible that the fans had extremely high expectations. As a person not invested in the Marvel universe, I can say the film was exciting, visually appealing, action-packed, humorous and fun to watch. Not disappointed in the acting, either. I went to see it in the cinema for entertainment and it definitely provided just that. It's a superhero movie, of course it defies the laws of nature. That's the whole point. Go to see it without unrealistic expectations and it will be enjoyable."
1876,7,Back to Old school Marvel with a basic Solo movie that came out to late. Black Widow gives me Old School Marvel Vibes with more Basic Storyline and Downtoned action scenes.That's what appreciate with Marvel that they really take time to do a full om Black Widow Story just for us fans.I also hope they stick with more down to earth movies in the future.Like it was so diffrent to go from watching Loki to this.That's what i like from Marvel . The opportunity's to choose a movie/Serie from what mode you are in and how you please fans.I feel like they suceeded to please me with this one as a Black Widow movie But no suprises and the last scene was a little bit dragged out.I also feel like it would have done better impact if this came out after Civil War.Opening scene gave me Goosepumps and is so well done! Love it.A strong 7/10.
1877,5,"(SPOILERS!!!) Black Widow felt lazy and poorly paced Black Widow opened up very strongly with opportunity to flourish in a multitude of different directions, but failed to do so. The opening sequences are great as we meet the different cast members and have their roles defined, but that felt like the entirety of the movie. While it's understood that the majority of this film is a recollection of Black Widow's past, a large chunk of this movie felt like ""Black Widow is on her way to meet ""x"" character... Again"". This lead to the plot feeling very predictable and hackneyed, even for Marvel's standard. You know what you'll get when you go to a super hero film, but even this was dull. The lack of action and amount of rehashing scenes made for very slow pacing.Another issue I had with Black Widow was the lack of a compelling villain, even with one of the coolest Marvel villains being in the film. Let's make this very clear: from the standpoint of a comic book nerd or casual watcher, this is NOT the Taskmaster you want to see. Instead, Taskmaster is used as a pawn to serve a one dimensional villain that has been done thousands of times. The height of action in the film barely involves Taskmaster, which is just disappointing. Instead, we get a small scuffle with Red Guardian and an apology from Black Widow. Yes, Marvel, this is exactly what people want to see from (what's supposed to be) the most badass character in the film.The conclusion to the film is incredibly lazy, too. Classic misdirection by the director to make it seem like Black Widow will be turned in by her mother, only for that to be the plan all along. Any hole in the story moving forward is then met with a flashback to a conversation you never saw in the first place. What makes it so awful, though, is that it's all predictable. I found myself rolling my eyes multiple times in the last act.Overall, I'd say this a Marvel film you can skip. I don't think it will add much to the overarching story of what's next."
1878,6,"Lots of destruction Pretty typical superhero movie with lots and lots of things blowing up. Also, the characters would have had lots of black and blue bruises since they seemed to crash into things up, down and sideways constantly.I've seen most of the MCU movies involving Natasha but I still had no idea what was going on until well into the movie, maybe about half way.Unfortunately it was cringeworthy with the child abuse angle as the bad guy's organization took little girls right and left and turned them into mindless killers while having them beat each other silly and deliberately killing off the weak ones.Despite all that, it's pretty good for an action movie."
1879,4,"Not quite worth the wait, supposing anyone still waited A defining characteristic of the MCU fandom has long been its inability to deal with death. Usually, Marvel's action scenes have little weight, seeing as almost nobody dies (or visibly runs the risk), and so when even someone bland and disposable like Quicksilver gets axed, fangirls will start a petition to revive him (yes, this seriously happened).You can imagine, then, the tears that came when Avengers: Infinity War dropped and its villain proved to be a serious threat, only to have most of his victims return by the time we got Avengers: Endgame. Even their worst and most heartbreaking wasn't too bad.However, one death that still meant something was that of Natasha ""Black Widow"" Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in the latter production. What must we do to help the fanboys cope, I wonder? Simple: include her in a midquel set after Civil War, featuring bit characters that are absent and unmentioned by the time Infinity War's plot comes along. The MCU canon has always seemed remarkably well-thought-out, but as proven by Captain Marvel, it gets tricky when they start adding major events ""in the middle"". Some of you already know what I think of Loki and TFATWS but let's focus on just the movies for now.The plot: after the events of Civil War, self-exiled Avenger and former S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Natasha Romanoff finds that her troubled past in the KGB (briefly alluded to in Age of Ultron) is catching up with her, as she reconnects with other ""Black Widows"" (Florence Pugh as her adoptive sister; Rachel Weisz as her adoptive mother) and The Red Guardian (David Harbour), Russia's equivalent to Captain America. There's also Natasha's former S. H. I. E. L. D. colleague, played by O-T Fagbenle - a name I am not 100% sure I'm actually allowed to say.I liked the prologue more than anything else. We see younger versions of both Natasha and Yelena (the Pugh character, whose younger self looks more like the Johansson character and vice versa) as their Black Widow lives truly, hauntingly begin. The subsequent credits montage is a visual feast (though the spooky lullaby cover of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" won't be universally adored) and nothing else in the film compares to it.Still, this long-overdue solo adventure is occasionally gripping and uses its classic spy-movie tropes charmingly - even if some concepts are too dumb for even Austin Powers. But considering how wild and ""out there"" the rest of MCU Phase Four is getting (with multiverses, Time Keepers, et al.), this comparatively vanilla comic-book movie may be too little too late for most geeks, barring the hardcore Black Widow fans. Some of it gets pretty dark, then punctuated (and deflated) by the typical MCU comedy, which gets way worse halfway through. The effects and shoddy greenscreens won't be a huge draw either. All of this is a shame, considering this is the first proper MCU film release since 2019.Disney, along with the usual journalists, have admittedly done their damndest to generate juicy PR. There was a fruitful attempt to get a rise out of angry nerds with articles claiming men will be ""put in their place"" by this movie and outright squeam (sic) at the sight of women kicking ass, which the other side was naturally meant to laud as the most empowering thing since Ghostbusters, Ocean's 8, and the all-female reboot of Die Zombiejäger that I just decided to make.But people are getting smarter, at least when it comes to films like Charlie's Angels, Wonder Woman 1984, and now this. Even Twitter feminists can see through the narrative that these movies were hated purely because they star/celebrate women. Bad movies are bad movies, no matter what the message is (or pretends to be) or who you can spite by supporting it. Yes, some dudebros still got mad at the article, but even then, many of them just seemed weary of the same old spiel and how transparent it's getting. While I'm sure Disney coaxed one or two angry videos out of The Quartering and Geeks+Gamers, fighting like toddlers over big-studio cinema just isn't what it used to be.The movie itself is, simply put, pretty lame. It isn't outlandish enough to compete with the rest of the Phase Four media and it doesn't even play like something out of Phase 3 where things started getting ambitious and/or weird - with retro oddities like Thor: Ragnarok and visual marvels like Black Panther, give or take the odd CG rhino. Instead, this would be at home amongst the lame, contrived sequels of Phase Two. You know, back when people were excited about the idea of a Black Widow movie?I've also been told the character of Taskmaster constitutes another Mandarin scenario (à la Iron Man 3, also from Phase Two) but I don't know enough about the original comics' character to judge. My mind is all Watchers and Time Keepers at the moment; you think I have time to worry about some Russian spies and a creepy incel in a sky castle? Dosvedanya, Romanoff."
1880,8,Did not get all the hate I mean its not great but It is a pretty good movie. 30$ made people salty i guess. Good filler try it once.
1881,2,"Discount Jason Bourne If you forget the movie is supposed to be about black widow and try to imagine its just some b grade action movie, then I'll give it 5 stars.But as a black widow movie.. I gave it a 2 and that was generous."
1882,10,"I felt I needed to score it a 10 to boost the score. For this film to dip below a 7.0 is criminal! Another great film from Marvel and both of them did a great job. Although it slows down a bit in the middle with lots of talking, the action generally keeps going pretty much throughout. Definitely go see it!"
1883,8,"Far better than Expected I am generally not too fond of follow up movies, and did not expect much at all, maybe that is why I liked it.It is not a typical Avenger movie, it is very tongue in cheek, it has lots of action, Yelena is pretty awesome. Not much in terms of plot, character development, etc etc. It's just a fun movie, plenty action, excellent CGI, humor, a light plot, explains a lot of things in a very peculiar way. Don't expect much, and you'll really enjoy it.BTWMore Yelena please, Natasha is a poser !!!!!! :)"
1884,10,"Marvel Cinematic Universe keeps getting better and better Black Widow, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a huge hit on Disney Plus and was a huge hit in it's entirety. As soon as I turned it on, I knew I was gonna be hooked because it's from Marvel. The only one that sucked I think was Harbour's satirical accent which he did not do that on 2019's Hellboy which was just a hell to have to listen to that. Pugh and Johansson was the real deal on this movie as they were the sidekicks who were kicking ass, Hurt was barely seen on this picture so can't really say nothing about him, Winstone was just a coward who had control but still got kicked though and beat, which was fun to see. We ended up seeing a lot of action but that's to be expected on Marvel movies. This one was a really good one so not sure where all the lowlife low reviews but this one was very well done and the least to say this was a 10 on my book."
1885,9,"The Black Widow gets the solo film she deserved, but watch out for little sister. It has been awhile since the fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have had a feature length film to enjoy, but after being delayed for over a year due to the pandemic, the public finally got to see BLACK WIDOW, the stand alone movie built around Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff, a former assassin turned SHIELD agent and then a member of the Avengers. Natasha made her debut in IRON MAN 2, and had been a mainstay of MCU films since. Though some fans have had problems with how her character was handled from one film to the other, Johansson's interpretation of the character created back in 1964 by Stan Lee, Don Rico, and Don Heck, developed a huge following, and of course, a demand that she get a solo film of her own same as Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Thor. When The Widow met her final fate in AVENGERS: ENDGAME, it was a gut punch of a twist, and seemed to forestall the possibility of a standalone movie, but Disney/Marvel found a way to give the fans what they wanted by making a film a set right after the events of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, where the Avengers were disbanded, and Natasha was a fugitive from the American government, and hiding in Europe for violating the Sokovia Accords.I made a point to see BLACK WIDOW cold, purposely avoiding any reviews, and most importantly, any spoilers. This aided my enjoyment of the movie tremendously. The film opens with a flashback to a happy family living in suburban Ohio in 1995, a father, a mother, and two young girls, but they are soon revealed to be deep cover Russian operatives; with their mission completed, and their cover blown, they flee America for Cuba in the first of THE BLACK WIDOW's many impressive action scenes. The older of the two sisters is Natasha, who, once in Cuba, is given over to The Red Room, a criminal organization that takes control of the minds of the girls it recruits, and trains both her, and her sister, to be assassins. Now, years later, the fugitive Natasha is back to reconnect with her former ""family,"" and take down The Red Room, and its leader, General Dreykov. Along the way, there are a number of well staged chase sequences, hand to hand combat, a breakout from an arctic Russian prison, a couple of plot twists and turns, and some genuine character development.BLACK WIDOW has scenes and plot threads which are clearly similar to THE AMERICANS, KILLING EVE, and a finale that echoed the end of WINTER SOLDIER. None of this I minded, as BLACK WIDOW takes those similarities and truly makes them its own. And like many other Marvel films, it has got the art of three act storytelling down pat. For all the great action scenes in the film, the story is truly anchored to the dinner table sequence at the end of the second act, when Natasha and her Russian ""family"" are finally all together, and they sit and talk about their mutual past, what was real, what was not, and what it meant, along with the enduring pain it caused. Its proof that even in an action heavy super hero film, it is necessary to build character, and get the audience invested in them. It also helps the cast great actors like Rachel Weisz as Natasha's ""mother,"" and David Harbour, as her ""father,"" the former Soviet super soldier known as The Red Tornado; Harbour's performance is a great balancing act of the dramatic and comedic, creating a past his prime super hero who refuses to quit. The breakout star of the film is Florence Pugh, as Natasha's little ""sister,"" a good assassin in her own right; Pugh was awesome in the horror film MIDSOMMAR, and she nearly eclipses Johansson here. When you cast Ray Winstone, who plays Derykov, as your main villain, than half the work is done. Some might be disappointed that Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. Samuel Jackson, or Mark Ruffalo didn't make cameos in their own iconic MCU roles, but the decision was made to keep the spotlight on Johansson, who more than earned her right to a solo star turn. William Hurt does appear as Thunderbolt Ross though, a way of connecting it all back to all those other film's continuity. I must give high praise to director Cate Shortland, and screenwriter, Eric Pearson; together they have given us a movie that is par beside the three Captain America films, which are the best of the MCU in my opinion.Of course there is a post credits scene, one that suggests we definitely have not seen the last of Florence Pugh's Belova. And please put Cate Shortland behind the camera of some other Marvel projects, she knows how to do it right. As for Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff, she will be sorely missed, but we've got a great film to remember her by."
1886,6,Too many Marvel films I enjoyed the earlier Marvel films but like the Fast & Furious 9 the action they are relying on is becoming boring because too much CGI and the story is not thought provoking.
1887,10,Amazing🔥 Amazing movie I don't know why people don't like the movie but movie was amazing best action and story.
1888,10,"HATERS GONNA HATE Marvel excelled itslf in this movie i really don't know what else do you want . Amazing direction, clear story , camera man was so good , acting was on point , fight scenes full of amazingness please stop hating on the movie losers."
1889,4,"Just below average and a let down for the franchise. Just below average and a let down for the franchise.Story is predictable and its the same old wine in new bottle.Stunts were too below average, climax is not upto the mark, dragging scenes at the beginningThe chase at the beginning was the only good part. Concept of villain is too easy for this story. Such a plotless story !Only good thing about this movie is that, this went for the spark of re-opening box office wordwide after the pandemic. Kudos for that !We can clearly see the standard of Marvel Stories is coming down and DC is improving the same."
1890,6,"Entertaining movie The movie is good, it is not a big deal but it is entertaining, a pop corn movie."
1891,7,"Just a great Marvel movie. People act like this had to be a movie that is equal to Infinity War or Endgame, when looking at the effect it has for the future.This movie is a fun story that explains the past of Black Widow and how she really needs to face her past again.The action is great. The jokes are fun. There are some cool twists. There are references to the MCU and a great post-credit scene. You will have a really good time watching this film.I really loved this movie on its own."
1892,4,"Clumsy, Dumb and Disappointing Really really Disappointing film.Really really Disappointing film.Really really Disappointing film."
1893,7,"An average Avengers film There are some people complaining about the M-She-U and how they messed Black Widow up and so on. They are exaggerating. Black Widow is just an average Marvel film with the same level of logic, subtlety and action as, say, Captain America. Meaning it isn't smart or great, but it is entertaining.The problem with the film is that it uses this theme about Russian sleeper agents, so they get Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour to play them and speaking with awful Russian accents. OK, you will say, they had to have A-listed actors to play in a Marvel film, not Russians, but they had The Americans as a blueprint on how to make this work and they did not care. You do know that sleeper agents don't speak with an accent, right?And there was another issue, that of Florence Pugh stealing the show, even if her character was pretty inconsistent and not having her title the film. Faking a dull Balkan fatalism in everything she did, and with a deadpan sense of humor, she kind of showed us what probably Wanda should have behaved like. Finally, Olga Kurylenko. She got me excited with her character and being introduced in the Marvel universe. Yet in this film she had like one line of dialogue. More to come, I am sure, but still.The future of this storyline seems to be an all female New Hydra vs New Shield thing, like a mini Civil War. I just hope that in it males won't be either fully supportive guys in the friend zone, psychopaths, comical relief or fully covered in uniforms and masks as henchmen."
1894,7,"Good for a marvel fix Great to see a marvel film back in the big screen!Set just after captain America civil war it shows the black widow(Scarlett johansson) as a fugitive for breaking the sokovia accords. It shows her reconnecting with her family to take down an old enemy who turned her into the trained killer we no.I was skeptical about this film with obviously knowing that she is dead after avengers endgame, didn't really see the point in her having her own film but I actually enjoyed it. It had lots of action and quite a few laughs too, with a fair few avengers references which is always good to see been a big marvel fanDefinitely worth the watch, no where near as bad as some of the other reviewers have said, had an interesting post credit scene too."
1895,4,"What, really??? Absolute crap, from the escape from Ohio scene (yes even a trained military operative can hang from a plane and snipe a car in front of him, apparently?). To the dodgy conclusion. The timeline is also all over the show, did you forget Marvel about the timeline?!?! Bar Black Widow and Ross, I doubt you would know this was part of the MCU!"
1896,3,"More marvel fodder More fodder for the masses. All fight scenes seem to be taken from the Bourne movies, nothing original one could care less if any of the protagonists survived till the end. A totally forgettable movie."
1897,8,"Pugh for the win! I can't believe all of the negative comments this movie is getting! It was good. Not great and definitely not bad. Pugh, who plays Yelana, was outstanding. I've always like Rachel Weiss and Johansson gives a solid performance. I had hoped that would have taken the storyline back to the earlier days but still feel like they did a good job filling the gap between Civil War and Infinity War.It's with watching and 1,000 times better than what DC did with Wonder Woman 1984."
1898,5,"One of the worst Marvel movies ever I'm sorry but, who is Cate Shortland? And why on earth was this director given a 200million dollar movie to direct, despite not having ever made a good movie? This director has made 3 previous movies and all of them are mediocre. I seriously, seriously don't know why they gave such a MASSIVE movie, to such an inexperienced director. Marvel literally only have themselves to blame... they are the cause for this movie being bad.So, let's move on from the terrible director choice. The movie has several highly unrealistic scenes, and by 'unrealistic' I mean 'impossible'. When the viewer sees an impossible thing happen on screen, the viewer is immediately snapped back to reality and realizes that they're watching a movie instead of watching an epic fantasy saga play out. And ontop of the huge plot holes in the movie, I also for the love of me can't figure out how on earth a movie with a 200million dollar budget, has such bad CGI. The CGI in this movie is seriously 2nd-rate. I've seen movies with $20million budgets have better CGI than this movie has.It's a pity because I wanted Black Widow's movie to be good, but Marvel simply ensured that this movie could never be better than a 6/10 no matter what anyone did, even with a 200million dollar budget. It's sad, but this movie doesn't even warrant a single viewing, nevermind any repeated ones. 5/10, bad movie."
1899,10,Greqt movie but taskmaster ruined it The movie was really really good but the taskmaster storyline was really boring. Overall amazing movie. Definately worth the watch.
1900,2,"Absolutely horrible Although the production value is high, the overall quality of plot and story is extremely low.I am a Marvel fan. I am happy to suspend most logic because it is a comic strip. But this movie was absolute crap. Instead of making me interested in Natasha's back story, I actually cringed, I was bored, there was no inspiration, nothing.There are MANY logical plot problems. Simple, fixable, plot issues. But perhaps they think you are too stupid to noticed. Also, maybe they think you will have forgotten the copying they did from other films, that was years ago, right?So mediocre acting, with cut and paste script filled with logical plot holes.I do NOT recommend. But since I know if you are reading this, you are an optimistic fan, then take some espresso with you to stay awake. Any part you sleep through will be the best part of the movie."
1901,6,"Disappointed as hell This movie is not bad, it's just disappointing. Taskmaster, wtf how could they do 'him' so wrong! Plot?! Please it's too late for a story in between civil war and it's post credit scene. Come on we all know what happens with Nat so why did you make this movie now? The only thing I did enjoy though were the new characters but other than that disappointing."
1902,5,"Watch if you're a Marvel fan The movie doesn't live up to the hype. There should be a tag of 'family drama' as well. The movie lags in between, and more important scenes should have more time allotted."
1903,6,6 stars for Florence Pugh This film oroved what I have been saying from the beginning. Scarlett Johansson cannot act and to this day I don't know how she got away with so many film!!!Florence Pugh is a show stealer. She is SO GOOD at playing her character its beyond words. She should have been the Black Widow back when MCU had started! Regardless if she would seem too young to play the role she would have done more justice than Johansson's fame!There is absolutely nothing special about this film. Watch it at home or just pay attention whenever Florence is in the scene... otherwise its your regular hollywood revenge movie with a lot of costumes and gadgets.6 Stars for Florence Pugh.
1904,5,"I Think Movie Was cut in The end!!! Ok, Just imagine This, you are watching a movie, Everything is good, everything is going great you are middle of a movie and suddenly cuts to the final act. This was What I Felt, Movie was going good and Just cuts to The Final act. I Just see Why They did it. We needed more time With red Guardian with his family. They are having Family moments and They cut to the third Act........."
1905,7,"Great movie but It Could have been bigger 7 minus to be precise . Offcourse i had build up expectations ,who didn't after waiting another year for a new marvel release and the fact it's about the life of a female superhero made it even more important. The story behind black widow I thought it could have had more contains .the four leading characters that formed the made up family in the movie individually amazing actors except in this movie they didn't lived up to their full potential .there are some funny dynamics between them during the movie but I wanted to see more. Like I said it could be that I was expecting more than I should Have . Florence Pugh what an actrice. !! With some extra lessons in dialect she played her part as the sister more than well. And I'm not surprised marvel studios has more plans to work with her. Over all it's a great movie if you love marvel comics anyway and please don't let the reviews from other people ruining yours and if you wanna read them than do that after you see the movie yourself."
1906,10,"My favorite Avengers movie to date ""Black Widow"" might be my favorite ""Avengers"" movie to date.And it's not JUST BECAUSE it's loaded with babes.The story feels different than the typical masculine/macho comic book action movie.The beginning of the movie seems more like a James Bond spy thriller, but with emotions and family bonding and drama. And this family emotional bonding continues throughout the movie all the way to the end of the credits - definitely continue to watch past the End Credits like with all Marvel movies.There are some funny comic relief - especially when Black Widow's little sister pokes fun of how Black Widow always poses when she lands. And this poking fun is repeated a few times. I love it.Setting: very nice settings around the world. Love it.Plot: nice plot with some twists Character development: great to see the characters develop. This movie is character-driven.Climax/Resolution: nicely done.The action, like most actions movies, are very good. Great special effects.PQ: Reference quality as expected since the movie was shot using 8K digital cameras.SQ: Typical of about 99% of Marvel movies. Overall SQ is very good. There are some decent Atmos overhead effects, but nowhere near reference quality for Atmos.I definitely want ""Black Widow"" in 4K Atmos. This is the type of movie I would re-watch repeatedly.I can see potential ""Black Widow"" sequels."
1907,4,"It's boring... This Avenger film is really boring. I don't knw why do they even made it. While watching this film, i literary fell asleep twice."
1908,2,"Why isn't anyone blaming the Director??? It was pretty apparent that this movie would descend/condescend too wokeness given the director that helmed it... CGI may have been used as a cover for the poor writing and directing, but ultimately the studio and producers put this worthless woe is me all women are victims POS in the chair.. deconstructionism is thoroughly destructive."
1909,1,"Indian movie I donnu why marvel made this hero, she is not super after all."
1910,7,"A fitting swansong to Natasha Romanoff, a cornerstone of the MCU! The most overdue MCU movie of all hit the screens today, with Scarlett Johansson finally getting her standalone film in the terrific 'Black Widow'.In the aftermath of the events of Captain America: Civil War, we catch our favorite femme fatale on the run and facing enemies old and new with both the US government and the Russian Red Room on her tail.Florence Pugh is introduced as the heir-apparent to the seemingly irreplaceable Natasha Romanoff, but carries herself with grace, poise and immense likeability. Her chemistry with Johansson is electric and makes you buy into the sisters' journey and shared pain easily.David Harbour is incredible as the 'Red Guardian'', the weathered the former Russian counterpart to Captain America. Rachel Weisz and him are spot on as the parental figures, essaying the pain and suffering they have undergone with authenticity and realism. Ray Winstone is his icy, brutish best as the main antagonist.The key standout element of the film was the excellently choreographed hand-to-hand combat sequences, really raising the level of Marvel movies to Bourne-esque realms.Watch out for not one but two surprise guest appearances that not only tie into the upcoming MCU films but also continue the intricate world-building happening through the Disney+ series' Loki, TFATWS and Wanda Vision.Black Widow is a Natasha Romanoff show through and through, a fitting tribute to a founding Avenger and a role that has been portrayed with such perfection by Scarlett Johansson for over a decade now.Highly recommended! Marvel's first movie of 2021 is a surefire blockbuster!"
1911,10,loved it ❤ It is quite good movie.Natasha is one of those characters who hasn't been explored yet. And watching her solo movie is great.
1912,2,"Mindless Violence with Oestrogen Had this soulless , plotless trash been filmed with male characters, wow it would have bombed mightily. But with 98% of the people on screen female I guess in the current woke climate the endless fight scenes, explosions and meaningless duels where of course no one really gets hurt, will be overlooked.Looked at honestly this is awful, the ridiculous number of holes in the paper thin plot should make this a comedy. But sadly this offering isn't exciting, it isn funny and frankly not even interesting. What a stinker ! More reminiscent of B grade so called action movies from the 70s , but not as good. Shame on you Scarlett."
1913,3,Spending the whole movie trying to justify why it should exist You will spend like 40 minutes trying to figure out why the movie was made. Its a terrible movie according to me. How do you keep a person awake to operate on them? How does a prisoner come out of prison without being shot while almost every guard had a gun with him? How does a guy who beat everyone in prison get beat by a young girl without even standing a chance to win? The whole movie is garbage and it feels like a waste of time except that Scarlett Johnson was there. Very disappointing.
1914,4,Disappointed This could have been great and I actually fell asleep because of how boring it was at times.
1915,8,"Spoiler Free Review What a fantastic first movie to see on a big screen after 16 months!!!I went into Black Widow expecting part Bourne style spy thriller, part bombastic Marvel movie. And it definitely met both those expectations with flying colors.What I wasn't expecting was the laugh out loud family comedy sprinkled throughout.Scarlett Johansson has always been adept at dry humor, but Florence Pugh is hysterical throughout. Rachel Weisz (where have you been??? Please don't leave us again!) And David Harbour (who deserved a much better Hellboy movie) were both fantastic as well.And Marvel's decision to have a relatively unknown female director pays dividends from the start. The movie has a tender undercurrent of family, trauma and coming to terms with the choices you make that might easily have been missed by a more conventional action style director.And yes there is an end credits scenes at the very tail end. I laughed my butt off, and it is definitely leading ti something big down the road...Is it consequential to the MCU... maybe not? But it is fantastic to get a long overdue deep dive into one of the core members of the Avengers. And any movie that gives me not 1, not 2, but 3 ass kicking women main characters and passes the Bechdel test in spades? Yeah, sign me up.8/10And sidenote to this. If you can and you are comfortable go see this on a big screen! We did IMAX and it was fantastic. Action, gorgeous vistas, more action. Worth it. But if you are still only up for At Home viewing then please pony up for the Disney+ premium access. We need Hollywood to know we want more female led films and they listen to dollar signs before anything else."
1916,1,"Worst marvel To sum up , it was such a waste of time !The story is slow , confusing and barely about black widow . The action scenes are ridiculous. Humour is bad... And why does it have to be a feminist movie everytime that the hero is a woman? Women saving women ."
1917,1,"Russian cranberry over feminist dressing What do we think after reading the title Black Widow?Marvel, Avengers, Action.What do we get? Russian cranberries flavored with feminist dressing. Another Russophobic nonsense, filmed by order of the State Department. Watch only to oppressed minorities and people with a developmental level of five years old, the rest do not waste time."
1918,5,We'll always have End Game These film makers really seem to underestimate their audience. Do they really think they are fooling us? This movie was simply about introducing us to the black widow's replacement. It's too bad because I thought she earned her own movie about her.
1919,1,"Dissapointing big time VERY BAD SCRIPT first of all.There are sooooo many characters that I can hardly ""see"" Natasha. What the hell is wrong with you people ?! A lot of CGI which sucks.Unrealistic fight scenes in the middle of the town where pedestrians are not reacting........really?Not to mention the fake Russian accent of the actors :))))) Thank God i didn't have to pay to see such a bad movie.You failed."
1920,7,"Great action, just wish it came out after sooner What an opening sequence! The soundtrack, the grainy, gritty camera shots and hints of action/violence really sets the tone of the movie as well as hits home the atrocious nature of Natasha's past.I would say my biggest gripe with this film is its lack of consequence in the wider mcu, mainly due to its chronological placement. This is set right after civil war and ends right before infinity war. Why marvel decided to tell this story after they killed off the character in endgame still confuses me, as this would've fit perfectly after civil war and should've given black widow the solo film she deserves whilst she was still an alive member of the team.Overall a really enjoyable action/spy flick, with some funny dialogue and some hard hitting scenes. Looking forward to seeing how Yelena fits into the wider mcu story now."
1921,5,"Not great, not awful Anyone who tells you this movie is anything more than a 6 or 6.5 is just flat out wrong. Yes, movies are subjective but this movie, although entertaining and funny at parts, fails to really grab hold of the viewer and make them care about any of the characters the movie just expects us to care for. Natasha's sister and ""father"" are the highlights of the film and that's really it. They wasted a great character in Task Master, the villain, played by a fantastic actor was also a wasted opportunity."
1922,7,"Good action spy thriller What you feel about this movie depends on what you wanted it to be. If you go in expecting a big sendoff to Scarlett Johansson and her version of Black Widow, you will be slightly disappointed. But if you wanted to see how a Fast and Furious-esque movie from MCU would look like, you would have wonderful time. They open the movie strong by letting us know what's like to be in the Red Room. We get to see a glimpse of happiness these girls had in their life before they were turned into deadly assassins. Action is a major part of this movie and they sure have it in plenty. Those scenes are really fun and entertaining but a lot of it suffers from poor editing. Editing in general is not the strongest aspect of this movie. The visuals effects and cinematography were top-notch as expected from a marvel flick. The score and song choices were also nice.The cast, lead by Scarlett Johansson, does quite a good job with what she was given. Natasha Romanoff shines really well, especially in the silent moments. Among the new additions, Florence Pugh stands out the most. In this film she steals it from Johansson based on her personality and raw acting skills. Not only is she competent with the fight scenes, but she is the most emotionally engaging and also funniest character in the film. I'd go as far as to say this is barely even the Black Widow solo movie fans have been shouting for. This is absolutely Yelena's movie. There is a post-credit scene which suggests we'll be seeing more of her pretty soon; and that I am 100% here for. O-T Fegbenle's Rick Mason is not a character you'd expect much from but he was really fun. His scenes with Natasha were one of the better parts of this movie. David Harbour was having fun with character but I'd have loved to see him do some serious stuff or get involved in a cool fight scene. Rachel Weisz was good but wasn't utilised to her full potential. However one of the major disappointment that has to do with this movie is the villain(s). Ray Wintone's Dreykov was given nowhere near enough backstory. We barely learn about his motivations. Taskmaster was far less intimidating that I was led to believe they'd be. The character is supposed to be able to learn and mimic the fighting styles of their opponents - including multiple Avengers. This Taskmaster could barely contend with Black Widow (a human) or her out of shape and past his prime father. This Taskmaster was more like a supermarket own brand Terminator. The movie ends on a high note in the third act. The high octane high scale action sequence sprinkled with some genuinely good character moments really sealed the job.On the whole, BW is a grand action adventure movie that tells us more about Natasha. Besides her story, there was sibling rivalry and family humour."
1923,8,"Black Widow: ""Die hard"" on Marvel Path Jeez when i first time saw this movie trailer I wasn't sure that this is going to hype me that well. But, after saw the film it was changing me at all.. ""Is it the best marvel movie?"" Obviously not for me.. ""But is it different?"" Yes it is.. Well in the beginning they're add some opening credit that Marvel movies infrequently do that, but in this movies they add it out. And after that the performance are nailed it. From middle to ending i can saw potential from Florence Pugh that obviously she remarkable actress, and add David Harbour also make me laugh at many scenes though. Alright now move on to minus point from this movie, Well first it's obviously too late too realise the movie in 2021 (goddamn it pandemic) because this movie will get the hype in 2020 when natasha died on endgame that actually release in 2019.. (Spoiler even most of you already know it) so most of us have the sympathy of the character, second the movie obviously not focus on the main character (Natasha Romanoff) but I think they're focus on Yelena Belova which is Florence Pugh (Because the contract on Scarlett Johansson end in this film), and the last one I think there is too much CGI on this film that sometime makes me feel illogical to realize it out. Well I think it wasn't that bad to see the film its obviously great to a person who miss watching marvel movies Score:8/10."
1924,9,"Excellent addition to the MCU Yes, I've heard the common criticism that this movie lacks tension because we all know what happens to Natasha Romanov, and that it's also years too late and should've come much earlier in the MCU. All this is true and does indeed detract a little bit from the movie.However. This movie has a great script that deals with the issues of family and what it means to be part of one. It draws parallels between Natasha's two families, both not real and at the same time all too real. It's a got strong emotional core at the heart of the movie, and that always goes a long way in creating a satisfying viewing experience. The performances are strong across the board with Pugh being particularly outstanding. The action sequences are MCU standard, that is, freaking incredible.In conclusion, this movie hit all the right buttons for me emotionally and viscerally. In the list of MCU movies. Its the Black Widow is certainly in the Top 10 and might even get into the Top 5 with repeated viewings. Only time will tell."
1925,1,"Worst Marvel Movie Ever This was supposed to be the origin story of the black widow but all I saw was confusion.To begin with, the first 5-10 mins I was confused about which one was Yelena and which one was Natasha. The story seemed rushed. There was no origin story, who is Natasha, who are the parents nothing. This movie is all about feminism and 2 hours of mind numbing boredom."
1926,7,"Hoping for the best, expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised. Been a Marvel fan for so long (comic book worm) and I actually enjoyed the vision, acting and characters development. Can they stick a bit more to the comics? Yes. Can they use a little less CGI? Yes. But either way, just start enjoying the movies for what they are."
1927,4,"0 stakes film with mediocre action We know Black Widow dies in endgame, so there are absolutely no stakes in the film, the only other likeable character in the film was the blonde woman, and she was obviously being set up for future films, so again no stakes. The action was always either really generic or over the top and unbelievable. The parents were uninteresting, 2 dimensional characters who were only there for comic relief and to further the plot. Taskmaster was a complete waste of potential, with absolutely no motive as she was 'mind controlled'. The suit was a generic, dark colored, 'edgy' suit, a big step down from the comic suit. Not to mention they took away her only superpower and replaced it with technology, yet another overused trope for Marvel movies. They also tried to justify child murder, and suddenly it was ok because she was actually alive and being held against her will, much better than killing a child!Overall, rubbish film, would not watch again."
1928,5,Scar deserved better ! Two daughters seperated from their parents finally reconcile and share moments together.Sadly this is the plot of Black Widow and it is as dull/borrowed as it sounds. Couple of good action scenes but apart from that it is the same old saving the world from terrorizing psychopath hack. Not the farewell Scar deserved.
1929,4,Lack of realism I know is a Marvel movie but Black Widow supouse to be a human but in this movie she looks like she could easily beat up Superman himself:) or Hela and walk away unharmed. Next time they should ask Jon Favreau for help.
1930,6,"It is what it is Black Widow is an entertaining enough movie for Marvel fans but doesn't raise the stakes or add much new or interesting to the fold aside from some new characters that were introduced. At this point in time you know what you are getting from Marvel, above average entertainment that is ultimately pretty forgettable but fun because everyone else watches it and its fun to talk about. Some of the characters here will surely tie into more events going forward and Disney is still doing a good job of keeping the universe consistent and playing off other shows/movies to create a good overarching story."
1931,10,"it's a good movie y'all are just annoying I liked the movie. It's definitely a solid 8, but i'm giving it a 10 to compensate for the 1s that i saw on here. I bet it's mostly dudebros who are annoyed a woman is finally getting the spotlight she deserves lmao idk what movie y'all watched, but black widow was definitely not a side character?? Anyway, the plot was good, it was engaging and the action scenes were really good. Sure the vfx was shaky at times but tbh i don't really care that much about it.The found family dynamics were refreshing and funny, it's one of the few MCU movies that actually develops relationships between characters tbh. It's definitely in my top 3 MCU movies.To everyone complaining about taskmaster, i liked the twist and i hope they'll develop the character some more, if you don't like it just shut up and stick to the comics lmao."
1932,4,"Actors helped this movie a lot, if it wasn't for them my rating would be 1 star. I am not sure if we have superhero movie fatigue or maybe the timing for this movie was just bad. When I saw the trailer for this movie I already knew that it was going to be bad.I had a problem with a number of areas in this film. The CGI and VFX in general looked very cheap, it looked like a series in some scenes. The costumes in some scenes looked really bad, usually marvel has the best looking Super Hero costumes on screen.The script was terrible, or possible the execution of the script was terrible. The actors were all great, they did their part. But there's nothing they could have done to save a bad production.My rating is for the actors, if it wasn't for them this movie would be a solid 1 star. As to how this movie received an average over 7 makes no sense whatsoever."
1933,7,"Pretty solid even though it could've been much better Positives -After 2 years, we finally got a new MCU movie and overall it's a good movie. It has its flaws and it didn't meet my expectations. Mostly it works and it feels like something that Disney produced and that could be even a good or a bad thing.-The strongest positive of the movie it's the cast. I think the chemistry everyone had was excellent. It seemed that you've seen them interact before. By far Florence Pugh was the best one (I might have fallen in love with her). This is something that Disney does most of the time. Hire good actors that will have a good relationship with the fans in the future. Not only the chemistry, the acting was truly good. Better than in some other MCU movies.-Most of the characters are pretty good. I loved Yelena and Alexei. They were extremely funny and didn't feel forced. I'm truly hyped to see more of Yelena in the future. The rest of the characters were good. I would've liked to see more from Melina and even Natasha. I didn't feel closure for Natahsa's character and all she represented for the MCU in previous movies.-The action is excellent. There is no doubt that action scenes in Marvel have been improving with the years to a point that they became this epic and badass. The incredible action is thanks to beautiful visual effects. I didn't see many scenes where the CGI failed. It felt like a John Wick movie but with even more fantastic and unreal action which I love.-I loved the tone of the movie. A mystery and spy movie about Natasha escaping which connects with her past and a vengeance to be completed and allows us to meet new characters from her story. Characters that we'll see in the future and will be filling the hole that the ending of Scarlett's character left on a lot of fans. Something I liked was the way they connect it with movies like Civil War without feeling forced or the introduction of new characters without feeling like they could and should have appeared before.-I liked the comedy of the movie. I had an actual laugh at some parts of the movie. Let's say that only 15% of the jokes felt forced. Florence Pugh was G. O. A. T. I loved his character and his performance. She made me laugh a lot and without her this movie would easily be a 5 out of 10.-The post credit scene was the best part of the movie. It connects with other Disney shows and it opens a world of possibilities. I really want to see how it'll be handled and what direction will be taken.-I really liked Lorne Balfe's soundtrack. I loved him in M. I. Fallout and he killed it for Black Widow.Negatives -Black Widow is not even close to being perfect. It has a lot of flaws that are common in most MCU movies.-My biggest problem with the movie is the villain. Dreykov reminds me of the first MCU villains. Generic, boring, uninteresting, stupid and normal. I didn't like him at all and it's probably because it's a vengeance story which it's truly personal for Natasha's character but I just got to know this important part of her life. Plus the villain appears for no more than 15 minutes. Also Taskmaster was amazingly wasted. Why couldn't they go with the original story of Tony Masters and use him in the future to fight other heroes, because I don't see this character fighting Spiderman. This Taskmaster has no personality and lacks one of his best things which is his narcissism and his pride. He was pretty menacing until the ""big reveal"".-It was pretty predictable and the plot twists were meh. The only two I liked were the post credit scene and one more but the rest were unnecessary and too elaborated.-I keep thinking that this movie should've been made and presented before Infinity War. Knowing how the character's future ends makes you not worry about her and just focus on the rest.-A few plot holes that luckily weren't important.Conclusion I really liked Black Widow. I think it's a product that works and is successful in what they want, which is to introduce you to new characters that will participate in the future and will have a bigger role. The action was excellent and the style of the movie making it seem like a Jason Bourne movie was pretty good. The cast did a great job and I would love to see them again in the future. It fails in the villain aspect but at least that wasn't the focus. There is a villain because it's a superhero movie. And then there are the normal errors like some plot holes and how predictable it is. It's a movie that I recommend but I would say that if you are a true fan of Natasha you should watch it with low expectations because if not, you could dislike how the spotlight was focussed to the other characters. I would say that Black Widow is a John Wick movie with steroids."
1934,6,"Scarjo waited for her own movie, only for movie to not be about her I've never been a Scarjo fan, but I have enjoyed the character of Black Widow in the Marvel movies. I wonder if Marvel Studios does however. I mean we all know ScarJo was not their first choice to play the character, and she was regulated to being the only woman in the original male ensemble.She was also really the weakest of the characters, with arguably her ability to calm the Hulk being one of her stronger powers. This movie had a chance to tell her back story, but really only alluded to 3 years of it, 3 mainly unimportant years. We know more about the Winter Soldier's back story then Black Widow's.So this movie was about her former associates and Florence Pugh is by far the more interesting character with David Harbour being a distance 2nd. Rachel Weiz's character is really inconsistent, and then we have 3 or 4 really great action set pieces. Finally that leads to BW, who doesn't say a lot, doesn't do a lot except expose us to these other characters, and plays straight man for the villains and the cast.Sorry to break it to you Scarjo, but you're final starring vehicle/swansong vehicle was hijacked to set up a tv series and Pugh's future. They even added a pseudo Cap'n America character because they didn't think you alone could carry the flick. Hulk got his own movie, and half another when they changed actors. Hawkeye got his own series. You get your name at the top of a movie to play second banana. I do understand you got a bunch of cash, not as much as Downey Jr., but a nice some as a runner up trophy. Hope you spend it well."
1935,9,"Met My Expectations Worth A Watch It seems a lot of people who watch these films miss nuance. I don't know how anyone can say this film has no heart and is all action and explosions.One thing I've truly enjoyed as more women are getting a shot at directing is the emotional content and character development they typically bring to what could be over the top action films. There aren't a ton of those moments in a film like this, so the key is to make them count. The interplay between Yelena and Natasha is at times poignant and at others cutting. David Harbour also does a good job as the self absorbed father figure.I don't think we have to view this film as having wasted or ruined Taskmaster either. Let's think back to Origins: Wolverine and consider how we felt about Deadpool. Seems that worked out fine in the end, yes? I fully expect to see a more traditional rendition of Taskmaster in other MCU properties.The plot was predictable, but it was actually refreshing not to have the writers and director think they can pull one over on the audience for a change. It doesn't always have to be about the plot twist.The ending left the MCU open to taking Black Widow in a new direction, or at least adding another high caliber actor to the universe. Personally I'm a fan of Florence Pugh and look forward to what she can bring to the MCU.In the end this film met my expectations, which were high considering the cast and director. Its pretty rare when these films exceed my expectations, because I've actually read the source material. The writing in the better comics is really good, and often doesn't contain typical Hollywod endings, so its a rare film that can live up it, especially with a PG-13 rating."
1936,4,"Marvel doesn't care anymore. Another flat, visually sub-par and filler for the mcu.I get that they have opened for the multiverse. But the character is dead. They should have done this between Iron man 2 and infinity war. They simply don't care about their characters and only do things they feel will make money regardless of quality.Black widow is a great character that has been so mistreated."
1937,5,"Wait, what? I normally don't hate on Marvel movies because I love them but I had to address these silly/unexplainable things:1) The Red Guardian is portrayed to be a Russian version of Captain America. CA is basically a super soldier who was injected with a serum making him age slower, have super strength, regenerative powers etc. The Red Guardian only seems to have super strength. Nothing else.2) The Widows cannot attack Dreykov because of something in their nervous system so that whenever they can smell Dreykov's pheromones, they shall not be able to harm him. Wouldn't it be a problem if someone wore a gas mask or just shot him with a sniper from a large distance? They'd be away from the pheromones, no?3) Val tells Yelena that Clint Barton killed Natasha. Two problems arise with this: i) Where in the MCU timeline does the Black Widow movie fall? Presumably between or after Civil War as the Sokovia Accords are mentioned ii) How would Val be able to prove that Clint ""killed"" Natasha when Natasha actually sacrificed herself on Vormir and we actually SEE Clint NOT bring her body back either.4) Why would you gender swap Taskmaster, seriously?"
1938,9,"A great sendoff for Black Widow Off course you know how it ends for Black Widow in Avengers Endgame, but the filmmakers decide to tell a story before the events of that. And boy they did not disappoint, I really liked the way the film dives further into Black Widows past, and how she became the person she is today.My only real problem is with the action, now on some moments it's good, but in the rest it feels like I've seen in other Marvel movies. Scarlett Johansson is great, playing the character one last time. Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz also bring enjoyment in there roles. But the character Taskmaster really steals most of the movie, like Darth Vader, when ever the character is on the screen, you really it's presence."
1939,5,"WONDER WOMAN OF MCU. Regular Marvel movie without the soul as we feel we are watching left offs even though she is one of main avenger.It has all the traits of typical MCU movie.It got decent action choreography, comedy, DOP, hyped end credits scene but everything is just falling little short.I was soo excited to watch Scarlett again but it is not what we expect.Her role even though it's already garnered enough fan base in all Avengers movies but this movie makes us feel like Black Widow has no depth in her character.At the end of the day essence of the Marvel movie is saved and the franchise lives on."
1940,5,"Felt like something was missing There weren't any big revelations in the story but it's a good action movie. The symbolism was nice. I enjoyed the girl power aspect of it. But I wish the father figure Alexei, the Red Guard, had some better moments and more memorable lines. I'm glad it wasn't as ""gritty"" as I feared. I could watch it again."
1941,5,"It could be better :( As title say , as marvel fan this is worse than ""venom"" character not move haha , venom is better than black widow movie as "" MOVIE "" this is like waste of time and they didn't did perfect job , sorry it could be better."
1942,6,"Not a good movie If you want to watch Black Widow just watch it as a normal movie, don't expect too much. We waited for this but it's not worth it. Just watch it for Florence Pugh because this movie is all about her character - Yelena Belova - she did great job. I'm giving 6/10 only because of her and David Harbour.I would have named this movie as Red Room or anything related with Yelena Belova.This movie just sucks, there are few cool scenes like the scaping scene in start and first fight scene with Task Master.Overall the best thing about the movie is YELENA BELOVA (Florence Pugh ) and David Harbour's acting."
1943,5,"Fits OK as an entry after Civil War I'd watch this in timeline order if I were gonna through the entire MCU again. I wouldn't look forward to it, though.I'm surprised that Scarjo took an executive credit on this because it's hardly an origin story or really any story that provides interesting insight into the characters history. What it is is a vehicle (as many of them are) to setup the whatever comes next in the verse'.Performances were fine. The action was fine. The pacing was ok. Pretty vanilla overall.The only thing about the movie that really bothered me (and many others) was how they butchered Task Master. The character had been portrayed many different ways, from goofy henchmen to arch nemesis for some of the most popular characters in Marvel. Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that nothing about this incarnation made any sense or did any justice to that character. Shame, because Tasky could have been a better rogue in a better movie."
1944,6,"Disappointing movie after all that hype and the long wait This movie was very anti climatic after all that hype and build up. The start was promising. Pugh was awesome in her role but the movie seemed to focus as much on Yelena as it did Natasha, and it was supposed to be Black Widow's own movie. Frankly I found the movie a bit slow moving and tedious at times, the fight scenes were cool but nothing too spectacular. The Red Guardian and Task Master were totally wasted ! I looked forward to their fight but it was so anti climatic. Definitely one of MCU's weaker offerings, I left the cinema feeling this was just another filler for the phase and kind of feel like a bit of a waste of 2 hours. Off to rewatch a better MCU movie tonight."
1945,10,"An epic film. But... La Marvel ha fatto un ottimo lavoro, questo film è a dir poco fantastico... Però... Credo che Scarlett e Natasha meritassero più di un film, oramai questo personaggio è tramontato, in più di 10 anni non è mai stato coinvolto in un lavoro da solista, e questo di sicuro è stato un colpo basso dato che un sequel molto probabilmente vedrà come protagonista solo Yelena."
1946,8,"Black widow Maybe after all Stephen Dorff had a good point, it's a video game but "" it was a great video game"", the actors were great, I really like Florence perfomance, all the cast did a great job, but you can't but to pay attention for Florence accent, scarlett deserved the movie."
1947,10,"A really great film! Not sure what exactly is inspiring the negative reviews? Yes, the film doesn't really break any new ground, but dang! It is a completely serviceable and rollicking Marvel movie, and fits in well with the rest of the MCU. The only real complaint I have personally, is that it should have been made years ago, so yes, I agree with some reviews that complain of the lateness of the project, but ScarJo really (always and consistently!) knows how to sell a scene -- and this film is no exception! And yes, I also agree that relative newcomer Florence Pugh is near impossible to look away from -- she has genuine big-screen gravitas, and is likely to go on to have a very rich and varied film career. I have read some incredibly vitreolic reviews and am floored by them -- just exactly what is it that has made them so angry? It is beyond my understanding. Filled with gorgeous men and women running around and having adventures all over the place, with little injections of humor and pathos here and there, not overdone, just right! Why would anyone complain? I had a ball, I laughed, I hid behind my hands, I bounced on the edge of my seat, and even shed a tear or two. A complete success of a movie, even if it was waayy too many years late in coming. Also, I love movies that rarely refer to gender, and don't try to push anything down your throat, and this was definitely one of those films. Gender-schmender! Who cares if the story is filled with mostly men or mostly women or anything in between? As long as the story gallops forward at a decent pace and inspires you to care about the characters. Yep, a total win! Don't listen to the nay-sayers, I am genuinely not sure what movie they watched."
1948,4,"If Black Widow were a dish, then it would be a unacceptable scrambled egg. Sorry scrambled egg, no offend!Fighting scenes would be the eggs, cool enough, but they're just industrially produced.Not only baldly mixed but poorly seasoned. Lack of salt and pepper, the dish is tasteless. (After watching it, i forgot how to spell emotion)The family connection is the pity-small amount of butter which being put in the pan, at first seems to be sunshine yellow (in the trailer), though are not buttery at all and have gone rancid. Where is that richness, creamy of the butter, that suppose to melt my fragile little heart.This scrambled egg itself is mediocre, not to mention the woven basket it is served in, along with a pastry brush. All the aspects don't work together to become a distinctive, delicious and nutritious dish.As a friendly customer of the MCU restaurant, I am truly disappointed and regret eating this horrible so call scrambled egg.Note: The villain is a joke and Black Widow is lacking a bit of everything.Give it a five not a four because it could have been better."
1949,2,"Worset Marvel movie till now I always loved the character abd was waitting for a long time for this movie, but it was a real dissaponitment.Missing a lot of the Black widoe history. Skipping the most imprtant part in her life and details of her turning to the Black widow and just jumping to her last few years, you really let us down by this movie nothing even near what we were expecting and waiting for. So sad to ruin this character with such a nad movie."
1950,5,"Not As Bad As Some Say, Not As Good Either After reading many of these reviews I went into the cinema bracing for disaster. I was met with something that exceeded my low expectations but not by much. First of all, the fight scenes are exactly what you expect from Marvel. The plot was pretty plain and predictable but decently enjoyable at times. Wouldn't rave about it but it's a bit better than some have claimed it to be."
1951,10,Loved it I just enjoyed it... It is a nice movie. Rating also like people's expectations I guess. It varies from one person to another. How you enjoy things are different. Anyway just enjoy it...
1952,8,Don't listen to the grumbling. Just go see it in theaters. Don't let the haters form your opinions for you.
1953,7,Ok Florence Pugh is more like the star but it's ok. I guess she's passing torch.
1954,2,Garbage. Expected better from a MCU movie. I really liked Nat since she appeared in MCU and she deserved better. Probably the worst MCU movie yet.
1955,5,KGB Will Petrov and Bashirov be the next marvel heroes?
1956,9,"9 for sure also black widow isn't that powerful. Many people don't like this movie, but black widow isn't that much powerful. Why do you want black widow to have that much power."
1957,5,"Average at best In all fairness, Scarlett's character is one of the weakest of the Marvel bunch along with the Hawkeye, they aren't superhero's, and it shows in this film. A very weak story, fuelled with fight scene after fight scene, it felt more like a poor James Bond movie.Ray Winston's cockney Russian villain and some terrible Scarlett body-double shots towards the end were shockingly poor.I can't believe this film has such a high rating on here when the first page of reviews does not have a score over 5!Stan will be turning in his grave if this is the best Marvel can come up with now that it's owned by Disney."
1958,8,"We're done running from the past Black Widow is a spy thriller, action packed film. The first 30 minute on this was like a non-stop action because it's action packed. The whole film tells a story about Natasha 5 years ago about Natasha going back to her haunted past. Now the villain wasn't that great. Some moments in this film is very thrilling especially Taskmaster it actually made the action scene look alot more thrilling. The film is also like PG-13 Mature with some dark tone, this is probably one of the most darkest film in the MCU. The action in this film makes the whole film like full with action. Well it's not for kids under 13 to watch because the action does have some violence in it. Another thing that I really love is the character, the character is the reason why the MCU franchise is a successful franchise. The character backstory looks satisfying, emotional, with some thrilling moments and the family reunion was also emotional. The whole film wasn't too little, it's not too small the whole film is just a journey for Natasha going back to her past. The villain doesn't have any super evil plan. Now the way they tell a story about Natasha 5 years ago does feels kind of late but I don't really care much.Verdict: 8.5/10."
1959,5,"Finally, her own movie Well, it's been a while, but finally the next of the Marvel series has hit the cinemas, and they sort of jump back in time to explore a character that hasn't been previously explored - that is Black Widow (Natasha Romanov). It is in part an origin story, but it is also in part Romanov cleaning up some lose ends, but also providing a fitting farewell to the a character that we are unlikely to see again. Mind you, it wasn't as action packed as some of the other films that I've seen from them, but I guess it was designed more to flesh out Romanov's backstory, and to give us a better idea as to who she is, and where she came from (namely because she has really only been hanging around on the outer edges, much like Hawkeye).Actually, that is an interesting thing, because the film also seems to be setting up a story with regards to Hawkeye, which seems to be coming out shortly, though it looks like he will basically have his own series as opposed to a film dedicated to him. Mind you, there are still some things that are mentioned, such as his role in bringing Romanov over to the West and initiating her as a member of Shield.The movie begins in 1995 where Romanov lives with her sister and mother in the United States. Their father returns home and tells them that they need to leave immediately, and suddenly their quiet lives in the United States are upended as the two girls are taken away from their parents and initiated into a program known as the Red Room - where Soviet super-spies are trained (and it is interesting that they are all women, but then again they do tend to make the perfect honey pots).I didn't find this film as funny as some of the others. In fact, it seeems as if they tried to be funny, but in a lot of cases simply fell flat. This was particularly the case with Alexei. It was clear that he was supposed to be the comic relief, but in my mind it really didn't seem to work out that way. However, it was certainly interesting to see Harbour now inducted into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I suspect that this isn't the last that we will be seeing of them, though I also note that Marvel has gone down the way of releasing limited series, which I suspect has a lot to do with them attempting to promote their Disney + service.It also sort of felt to be a bit like Wonder Woman, though I suspect this has something to do with me watching a run down of it recently. Sure, Romanov is a spy, and she was working for the Soviets, or at least an ex-Soviet organistion. Then there is also this idea about how one's childhood is taken away, but not only that but their womanhood as well. This is noted when they speak about the hysterectomy, and that the womb is removed so as to keep them emotionally stable.However, I did feel that this film was somewhat drier than others, though I really did like the opening credits, which was seriously one of the best that I have seen in any of the Marvel Movies so far, not only because of the slowed down, haunting version of Smells Like Teen Spirit, but also the way they fast forwarded through Natasha's time in the Red Room."
1960,1,Garbage They could've done wayyyyy better for Black widow definitely do not recommend.
1961,7,"Right Movie, Wrong Time. As with most, if not almost every solo MCU movies, Black Widow has its fair share of flaws that is often masked by the supple cast. Great setup, decent plot, some surprisingly nice depth at places, but rather unmemorable villain(s) - one of which is marketed heavily to my memory, but ended up having about 5 minutes of screentime and very little actual action. It's not mind-blowing, but the cast (David Harbour in particular) is entertaining enough, and to be honest, I expected very low of this movie particularly after being delayed for so long. But it wasn't terrible, was actually pretty good to be honest.The one fatal mistake that I think most would agree on is that for some reason, this was conceived after Endgame. Because other than a little piece at the end, it has absolutely nothing to do with the events post-Endgame (2019), but mainly dealing in the aftermaths of CA: Civil War (2016), and Marvel had all the time in the world for that. It would've been meaningful and rather more shocking if this was released before Endgame - but right now, 2 years after? It just felt rather empty. Like an afterthought. The hype has gone down, the Disney+ Shows like Falcon and The Winter Soldier, WandaVision, and to a degree, Loki had brought the MCU ahead or to new and different directions, but Black Widow brought us back in time. Back to phase three."
1962,7,"this is my first review on IMDB. After all the hundreds of action movies.. i saw Balanced movie among all the other avengers , action melted with intelligent ideas plus fair dramatic scenes.. not amazing but unexpected fair script with logical steps + flashback .. at last I was focused without wondering putting the scenario together.."
1963,3,"Too much family drama, not enough action, implausible plot Black Widow (2021), for much of its 113 minute running time, feels like what one might expect from a Lifetime direct-to-video movie: a dysfunctional family struggling to overcome personal and interpersonal issues to embrace traditional middle-class family values. Movie-goers who have eagerly awaited a Star Wars prequel featuring Ma and Pa Vader and baby Darth will probably enjoy Black Widow, while fans of the franchise will likely be disappointed. The characters talk about the Avengers, Tony Stark, and Captain America, but not even a brief cameo or an Avengers logo is shown.With many in Hollywood apparently still clinging to discredited allegations of Russian collusion, the villains are Russians . . . More or less. The main Russians are played by British performers Ray Winstone, Rachel Weisz, and Florence Pugh, and Americans David Harbour and Scarlett Johansson. To avoid any allegations of cultural appropriation, none of the performers, with the notable exception of Harbor, seems to act very Russian, even while drinking vodka and speaking Russian.Part of the reason the actors don't seem authentically Russian may be attributed to the self-conscious diversity among the throngs of evil minions. Russia is generally considered somewhat less racially tolerant and inclusive than the Antebellum South, but the throngs of elite female assassins in their leather bondage outfits are ethnically diverse, as they prepare to turn tables on men who treat women as subservient. Unlike most movies, they wear no hoods or masks, to fully display that they are female and diverse. But the notion of Russians tolerating racial diversity among an elite corps of commando assassins seems improbable, leaving the impression of pandering to progressives - which also seems incongruous in a film featuring extrajudicial executions, assassinations, unauthorized wiretaps, enhanced interrogations, et cetera.The movie seems to be about 40% family drama, 30% feminist female empowerment, 20% action, and 10% gratuitous CGI effects, with a generous measure of misandry throughout.The plot is an absurd contrivance based on radical feminist talking points exaggerated to comic proportions. The villain's actions make little sense, unless one ignores logic and assumes he is an insane misogynistic megalomaniac. It also makes little dramatic sense, as the action is reduced to manipulating images on a huge computer display. In a fashion worthy of Dr Evil, the villain made sure his years of preparation could be undone with a few keystrokes and built his secret fortress so the slightest damage would trigger a sequence of cataclysmic explosions.As is common among many recent Hollywood productions, there is no typical B-story romance, offering instead a tale of sisterly love between two girls who aren't really sisters and aren't particularly lovable.There are several well-choreographed action scenes, including several fights among female martial artists. Harbour's performance is noteworthy, until he is sucked into the maudlin family drama. The movie is a disappointment on several levels. The family drama is so bogged down in the mundane that the fantastic aspects of the superhero story seem less credible, particularly due to numerous gaps in the plot. Beyond that, the film seems a harbinger of future disappointing efforts by a film industry that increasingly seems more concerned with virtue signaling, posturing and proselytizing about political correctitude than entertaining audiences."
1964,5,"Lifetime Original Movie with some action I was just bored. Directed by a woman, which is fine, but this felt like a Hallmark movie with a few explosions. Not horrible, but not one I'll return to."
1965,9,"A very grounded film with a lot of heart! I'm glad we finally get to explore Natasha's character even deeper. Even though it took longer to get a film like this made, I'm glad they took their time because the cast was amazing. This was a really grounded film! Florence Pugh was the heart of the movie, and I can't wait to see her future in the MCU. Bravo to everyone who was a part of this film."
1966,8,Behbod That was good film and i like it but has got some problems.
1967,6,"Can you really spoil a plot where nothing happens? What you need to know:The face-to-face with the main baddie lasts all of 5 minutes and couldn't be more lack-luster.Nothing of consequence to the rest of the MCU happens, sans a brief post-credit scene and a wink/nudge that suggests two of the characters introduced in this movie will be returning in MCU films/TV).Character growth is non-existent.Honestly, it's not worth risking the rona to see this in theaters."
1968,1,"Poor send-off for a major character *Spoilers* Ultimately, this movie is a serious fail, in no small part due to the overwhelming social and political messaging which serves as the backbone of nearly all interactions. Before getting to far into the negatives, this movie does have the usual dose of Marvel action, stunts, and witty one-liners, but beyond that it's bogged down by its own self-righteous Indignation. The opening scene draws in, but feels forced, not flowing as one would expect given the interesting concept. The opening credits sequence struck somewhere between horrifying shock value and an ASPCA commercial only missing the pictures of sad puppies and the song ""In the arms of an angel"" playing in the background. The frequent time jumps and location swaps were handled somewhat poorly often failing to explain why things were happening and leaving the viewer an overall feeling of being unsettled. Rachel Weisz's character felt very poorly developed which was shocking for a film of this caliber and an actress of her capability. David Harbour's character was also a huge let down as despite the comic tie-in, he is poorly developed as a character and seems stuck in the well-meaning borish oaf category. The villain was underwhelming, the final setting too fantastic; but ultimately the biggest failure was the forced social commentary which seems to be taking over much of Hollywood. In the age of the ""me-too"" movement, social commentary is accessible and appropriate in many areas of life, I am just not sure it always works well in entertainment. The Marvel movie ""Black Panther"" was very well done, and the social messaging throughout the movie, though prominent didn't take away from the story or entertainment value. The movie ""Captain Marvel"", while trying to pull off female empowerment left the main character in limbo somewhere between roll-model and one-demensional social justice warrior. Likewise, the female empowerment moment near the end of the movie ""Endgame"" was so formalized as to almost feel forced and condescending. That's not to say the issues being touched on are not important, merely that that there is a time and place for everything and in entertainment they need to enhance the value not undermine it. This was by a fair margin the worst of this trend and distracts or undermines the story, plot development, character evolution and eventually the movie as a whole. Not worth the increasing prices to view for what ultimately feels like a really beautifully rendered social justice lecture. If this is the new Marvel model, it might be time to find entertainment elsewhere."
1969,8,Black widow is must for black widow fans Great action set pieces plot was bit slow in places. Didn't learn anything new about the MCU.
1970,5,"Not good at all. I admit, I'm not the biggest sucker for Marvel, but I do love good action, and was expecting more from the trailer, than the movie could fullfill.The acting was not in par with the effects, and the storyline was not good at all."
1971,4,wont recommend it if you are gonna watch it on a small screen The fil is overfilled with vfx and the action scenes seem so unnecessary and the story has no originality but it can be a good watch if you watch it in 3d you wont get bored atleast.
1972,10,"I don't know anything about this But I saw Kevin Smith talking about it so I watched it! And I don't know about the comic-books , but I have to say I totally enjoyed myself , the whole thing was very very gripping! I thought only that the material was a bit harsh and more adult than PG-13 although very seminal and very interesting. The action was incredible! And the acting was spot on imo which means nothing , and some really cute jokes like the Poser thing! , but kinda dark! Coudl of been done super INdie rated R but would been more philosophical and a lot less action to make up for the difference but I think the source material warranted the R rating with more heartfelt deeply pathos moving erudite script but this was still very very awesome!"
1973,7,"Wasn't that good! I think the script was kinda mediocre, Taskmaster was so strong but the way they defeated her was easy as hell, the writer was pretty lazy i think so. Nothing in this movie lived up to my expectations but the actions. I gave The Tomorrow War 7 so it was kinda hard to give this one the same but i did it anyway. However i did have a pretty gud time watching it."
1974,4,Not so big fighting I watched the movie for watching black widows stylish fighting. But there not was big and good fighting scene. She fight only one minute with the main villain. Also others fighting was slow paced.
1975,8,Not Bad.. But.. Black Widow wasn't such a bad movie but at the same time it wasn't as good as my expectations. I loved the action scenes but the ending was somewhat disappointing.
1976,10,It was perfect I loved everything about this movie and Natasha's and Yelena's backstory was perfect and I really hope we see more of Yelena and I know Natasha is dead but I really hope somehow Marvel bring her back.
1977,8,Another fine addition in the mcu Finally Natasha Romanoff got the film she deserved. This is long overdue but the wait was worth it. I loved the look of the different locations and the outfits of the characters. A great story with many interesting new characters. Another fine addition in the mcu.
1978,3,"Generic female led action Marvel does what Marvel does well, but that's not to say all things need doing."
1979,10,Fell in love with Yelena Belova Florence Pugh is definitely a great addition to the MCU and Yelena's personality really stole the show.
1980,6,"Too many female characters The movie was entertaining but had way to much drama including a scene in the middle which just dragged on for awhile, we basically have 2 black widows, Scarlett Johansson didn't really even need to be in the movie since Florence Pugh was obviously the target for the main character in upcoming movies and this was a good way to introduce her (as we know Scarlett Johansson character didn't make it though the last avengers movie), and the ending credit movie already gave it away Yelena going to team up with the boyfriend (hawkeye) and find a way to bring her back (Movie or TV series), Whoops obvious spoiler for the next movie.But anyways this movie was horribly unbalanced too many female characters no men, no avengers, just some weird guy who gets her planes and stuff....ook, it just felt weird and off, then the nirvana song was weird too why do we need someone new singing it (very very slowly), play the original or don't play it at all, also I don't understand how this song fit with the movie in the first place....but whateverThe CGI looked very cheap in many scenes, we also have the typical invincible type character that are immune to damage, some scenes were just ridiculous.Over all I liked it better then Captain Marvel but not nearly as good as previous Marvel movies, infact it's very forgettable much like The New Mutants was..Scarlett Johansson did a good job, but sucks she had to share the spotlight with her upcoming replacement."
1981,7,"It's Unfortunate That This Wasn't Made Sooner I went into this movie with relatively low expectations, because Nat's character has always been one of the least dynamic and is consistently written as flat. While it is a solidly decent MCU film, having it be released after Endgame ruins what could have been some powerful character building. This probably would have been one of my favorites if it had fit better into the timeline."
1982,5,"Good performances & pace all around, but lack of self awareness and logic Overview The overall pace of the movie was good, however you need to suspend your disbelief to get through some parts, in particular the lack of logic, character development and meaningful dialogue. The lack of a moral compass, accountability, and understanding of general human behaviour and it comes across as cheap. There are also a lot of parts that just seem out of character.Performances of all the actors were great, Florence Pugh as always giving a great performance, I feel the writing lacked in a lot of areas though so well done for working with what they had but I do expect much better logic and writing for a movie set in the MCU, not the best start to Phase 4.Negatives Child Killing is Okay Black Widow blows up a child and it's basically just brushed over and justified, then it's discovered the child survived, ""so she wasn't so bad after all"".But the moral aspect of this I have a problem with, mainly with how the present day character confronts and justifies this. It's just brushed over and they do a terrible job treating this like it's an issue that can be resolved with action (by her saving this child now she's grown up) instead of some kind of introspective character growth.They don't properly address it for what it is, sort of like that WW1985 problem, but worse because this is child killing justified by a present day avenger.Plot Armour There's a lot of examples of this, but in particular the helicopter scene.Pugh's character casually aims a rocket launcher while bullets hit inches away from her to the left and right. We see bullets pierce helicopter, but it isn't shot down despite a million people are shooting at it. It's a normal helicopter acquired by some random guy, it's not made of Vibranium.This is too unrealistic and therefore hard to immerse myself in, I'd put it down to either bad directing or writing of those particular plot-armour laden scenes; you need an extreme sense of disbelief to enjoy them.As I said they're just not up to the standard I've come to expect from the MCU and I don't feel like this movie was given the respect it deserved."
1983,4,"This movie did not use it's full potential Everything was there to have a great movie and they wasted it, the designs, the actors, the visuals were great. The producers didn't utilize them correctly, Taskmaster was completely wasted and turned in a mindless female drone, Red Guardian was basically teased in this movie and never had his moment to shine, Black Widow feels like Wonder Woman in 1984 just doing what the plot tells her to do, and the movie just felt like a bad copy of the Winter Soldier. If everything was done right it could have been a great movie."
1984,9,"Heroine Overload I am starting to believe that people just rate movies badly or purposefully give them low scores because they have nothing better to do. When a production studio spends so much money and time in delivering a film as entertaining as Black Widow is, and people pay a mere ~$14 to see, then complain about it not being any good, you know they're straight up in dire need of a new hobby.The thing is, that it isn't really just individuals doing this. Recently there was some minor celebrity who was quoted as saying he felt bad for ScarJo and that she could have picked a better film to be in. Now this from a guy who next year will probably be auditioning for Subway commercials. Are these types of stories meant to stir up controversy, ergo 'talk', and as such, free advertising in the form of posts across social media?Either way, what a disservice for those who simply enjoy good movies.Was Black Widow a ""10""? No. Is it a Shawshank Redemption or Godfather? Of course not. But when you take the drivel that's out there earning 6's and 7s, to relegate Black Widow to earning anything less than a SOLID 7.5/8, is pretty sad.They story was extremely well-acted by everyone involved. Not one actor was out-of-step. More so, it was amazingly well-crafted in that it offered us a FULL back-story on Natasha Romanoff and answered as many questions as possible without over-cramming or becoming bogged down with surplus material. Beyond that, like all of Disney/Marvel offerings, it was funny. The humor ranges from simple to tongue-in-cheek to more complex, and is scattered throughout the film a'la Joss Whedon style. It is a feel-good movie full of action, heartfelt family moments, and the underlying sadness of knowing it is a prologue to the eventual end of the Black Widow's tale."
1985,6,"Totally fine! This film could have been better, ironically also meeting my expectations. Set aside the gripes I have that this film should have came out 6 years ago, or come before Captain Marvel (which would have made our goodbye to Natasha more dramatic when Endgame came along), this film was okay!Pros: Great cast and overall good writing (Florence was great) Compelling and unique story, in the first 2 acts High value production GREAT Score and soundtrackCons: TOO much comedy, ruined dramatic tension for MULTIPLE scenes Drakovs death was NOT a satisfying end TaskMaster was heavily underused Red Guardian was heavily underused This film felt like a lower stakes Captain America: Winter SoldierI love Marvel, and Scarlett. But Cate Shortland was not the right choice. Imagine if the Russo's made this.7/10."
1986,7,Worst Marvel movies but a good movie There is some boredom in the middle of the film and incoherence in the events.The story of the movie revolved around Natasha and her sister largely with the neglect of other characters.One of the positives of this movie is that the direction was more than wonderful.The best part of the movie was the scene after the end that made me really want to.
1987,9,"Black Widow Is One of the Best Marvel Movies! When I learned we were finally getting a Black Widow movie but the first trailer had me skeptical, I'm not going to lie. And then I watched the movie...three times...and I am a changed woman.This movie has everything; great action sequences, a fantastic musical score, lovable characters that I can't wait to see again, and yes, a lot of heart. This was the female-led superhero movie I was waiting for! And if you can, make sure you check it out in IMAX. It's well worth the price of admission."
1988,10,"Interesting movie Wow wow fantastic movie, fighting is super. I like this black Widow."
1989,10,"super BLACK recommended WIDOW This movie is amazing all the elements can really, we can enjoy the action but more than that this movie is very touching with a fake family background but there is a real relationship between them, it's a good message for us to respect our families.I know this is not a review, it's more an expression of admiration about this film and of course I really like black widow.This is my favorite movie."
1990,8,"Enjoyable Fitting Farewell Maybe it's because I've been starved of Marvel movies for so long but I enjoyed this film. In the midst of the spectacular, entertaining action scenes there is a plenty of heart & substance. It explores the concept of what family means. From the perspectives of the child and the care giver. The love and attachment of a kid for an indifferent 'parent'. Is it still a family? This is supported by some good performances. I'll miss Scarlett's Black Widow. Her story ends at the beginning with her origin which is poetic in a way. Long live Black Widow."
1991,5,"Hang on... what? Every rating on here gets an automatic +2 stars because this takes place in the MCU. This includes my rating. This movie is a mess. Sure, the action scenes are fun. But when did a Marvel movie make you slap your forehead like a Fast and Furious movie? Come on man.I'm all about powerful female characters. And to be honest, they were great. But the male characters are useless, boring and pathetic. This approach was unnecessary. Empower the women! But do so with some taste."
1992,3,"Hopping to forget the whole thing I was so happy to have a MCU movie again but this was a disaster. The Stranger Things' guy is the worst cast Marvel has had. There is no a good moment for this guy. The plot starts good, maybe amazing but the good part lasts 10/15 minutes. Then the horror!If you need an action MCU movie go and re-watch any of the other and pretend this mistake did not happen. There was so much to tell, so many lives to show, her knowledge and the things she accomplished but instead I had to watch Harbour in a endless scene talk with the most horrible Russian accent about a 2 year family."
1993,8,"It's decent I don't get the hate. It's a decent movie and when you end up watching the MCU over in order it will be a fun addition. The people complaining about the over the top action I guess forgot that this character has be back in time, to space, fought aliens multiple times, uncovered a secret regime in a govt agency, and probably hooked up with the Hulk. Chill."
1994,8,"I don't understand all the hate... It's certainly not the best marvel movie but it's still enjoyable. Yes, they butchered the character of Taskmaster but it really has no bearing on the plot. I think people had too high of expectations for this movie. It had humor, action, and ok-ish story telling. It could have been better, but it was really just an introduction for new characters. I wouldn't pay to watch it again, but I would watch it again. (But I refuse to accept that character as Taskmaster)."
1995,9,"THE MCU IS ON FULL POWER!!! Black widow is even more amazing and powerful than i first expected. I knew this movie was going to be great before i even saw the trailer, I've been waiting for this moment for years I'm glad they finally gave her; her own film. This really hits different now you really need to see endgame before you catch this yet another cinematic masterpiece, truly breathtaking i can't imagine the movie going any better than it did, they did everything i hoped for and I'm glad a fellow avenger didn't pop up as it could of been a risk of stealing the show/light.Black widow has always been a personal favourite of mine, not just in the movies but in the comics too, there is so much more to this character that we have learnt so far, such an iconic peformance from Scarlett Johansson, it really feels like no time has passed since between Captain America: Civil War & Avengers Infinity War as thats when this takes place, it was great to delve deeper within Natasha Romanoffs story, i really like her sister Yelena, i think she's going to be amazing.A perfect farewell to an amazing hero, make sure you stick around for the end credit scene... it's very vital to the MCU! I can't believe the reviews, some of them are really bad and i have no idea why, i guess they were watching a completely different film!Highly recommended, this is an incredible movie to add to your lists A MUST WATCH!!"
1996,1,"Boring Not worth seeing.I wish I did not see it, it was a huge waste of time for a very bad movie."
1997,10,"I liked so much! I loved, the characters, the history and especially Scarlett Johansson."
1998,7,"I thought it was great. I see a lot of reviews talking about how terrible it is, but I really enjoyed it. Several reviews are saying that it was too feminist and political, but I felt like they managed to largely stay away from that, which I appreciated. Great chemistry between Natasha and Yelena. I know a lot of the hate has to do with it's adherence to the comics, but frankly, I just look for a good story and a fun-to-watch movie."
1999,7,"assassin to agent Scarlett johansson is the best actress to play Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, she brings the spy and agent personality really well while also learning more about herself.I enjoyed learning more about her past and working with her sister to stop the spy organization named the Red Room, red gaurdian was played well by David Harbour and played the character close to the comics.I loved Taskmaster going up against Black Widow, the fights between them were awesome seeing and making it like the comics and a epic 3rd act/final battle.One of the brutal MCU movies but really entertaining and a surprising after credits scene I won't spoil."
2000,7,"Better late than never This movie should've come out ages ago after Civil War. So it feels outside of Phase 4. It's still alright, it's a good tribute to the character and an introduction to Yelena, another fun character. Good performances, good action. It's a good comeback for MCU."
2001,7,"Better late than never? This film should have come years ago. The biggest crux of this film is its importance to the MCU. I can't say this movie really impacts the MCU very much or was even that necessary at this point given the events of Endgame. It also felt more like set up for Yelena than a solo Black Widow movie at times.The biggest highlight, besides Pugh (very Villanelle-like in the role) and Harbour, is the family dynamic. Taking cues from The Americans, the Russian spy family story was compelling stuff. The action was pretty brutal and what I wanted from this film. The opening sequence and credits were excellent and I was hoping that tone would keep up for the rest of the movie.For negatives, Marvel really needs to get out of their own way. The constant jokes during serious moments really undercuts the drama and actual character development. This is a continuing issue and this movie may be the worst example yet. Taskmaster might take the cake for most disappointing MCU villain, which is saying something, so I really hope they do more with that character. The other villain was pretty generic too.I definitely have a lot of issues with this film, but it's hard to not enjoy the Marvel formula at this point."
2002,8,Round of applause to ScarJo The intense topic was so different than anything marvel had ever done and comedic family/sister banter was on point! I needed and want more!
2003,9,"Another Smash Hit from Marvel This movie was excellently executed. Slick action, engaging dialogue and plenty of your typical Marvel hero mayhem and destruction.Scarlett Johansson again did a superb job as Black Widow. She really owned the character. But IMO, Florence Pugh did an even better job portraying her character - Yelena Belova. It's a character that I quickly connected with - even more than the Black Widow character. I loved the interaction between Yelena and Natasha. Particularly how Yelena keeps teasing Natasha about her super-hero landing/pose. :)While I would have liked a bit more origin story (ie. More storyline of Black Widow's past), the writers did a great job in taking us along this journey. Though some periods of sentimental dialogue I feel went for a lot longer than they should have, it halted the fast pace the story has built.SUMMARY: Marvel did another fantastic job in creating an entertaining super hero origin story. But Florence Pugh I feel, stole the show.VERDICT: A must see if you love, action movies or super hero movies. Regardless, you will be entertained."
2004,9,"Emotional, beautiful and action packed! Diving into what happened during Natasha on the run during Civil War makes way for a good filler movie. Was hoping for more of her past life with Winter Soldier so disappointed in that but nevertheless this movie was entertaining and never a dull moment, I mean it's Marvel after all. Very emotional story line of all the Black Widows and lots of thrills! Go see it for yourself!"
2005,7,"Disappointing and taskmaster ruined The movie is okay, good action, good story and main cast of characters. But the villain and final fight is truly disappointing. The final fight isn't even a final fight, it's just Taskmaster and Black Widow falling, then a 10 second fight and taskmaster is done. Red Guardian is also wasted, he's strong and basically Russia captain America. His fight with taskmaster is barely show and it's just him getting his ass beat.Now for the most disappointing fight is taskmaster, he never speaks, he barely fights, and it's not a he, his gender is changed and it literally does nothing to improve or make the character interesting. Taskmaster is a very cool and interesting villain. Instead it's just a female being controlled and isn't actually bad. They completely wasted and ruined a great and underrated villain. Avengers game, Spider-Man PS4 game both do better taskmasters. Even with them both being barley in the game.Not a bad movie but disappointing, I feel like after a rewatch I'll like the movie more, but I'll never forgive them for ruining taskmaster."
2006,6,"Another Disappointing Marvel Product What is it about this pandemic that encourages Hollywood to keep churning out mediocre films? You'd think with people couped up indoors and limited diversions that they'd focus on the few things they're allowed to do, such as making movies. Yet even with all that time and focus, they still come up with mediocre movies like this.There are a few possible reasons as to why. One reason is Hollywood simply got lazy and took it's audience for granted, assuming because of the lockdowns, the audience would have little choice but to watch more movies. Another could be the depressingly lengthy lockdowns caused many filmmakers to be less inspired to create anything new and exciting. And finally, perhaps the current politically correct environment forced producers to hire filmmakers not based on merit but on superficial attributes in a superficial attempt to conform. But most likely it's some combination of the above.Anyway, about the film. Right off the bat, the movie had a tough task to make an uninteresting character interesting. But Marvel is no stranger to this. Two of the best films in their franchise were about previously little known superheroes, Iron Man and Thor. If they could work their magic on this film, perhaps they could capture our interest in the Black Widow, as they did about a guy and his special suit or a guy and his magical hammer.Unfortunately, Marvel's magic ended with Captain America. Black Widow stumbled out of the gate with an incredibly silly action sequence in which Natasha and her family escape trouble by taking off in their plane with her father hanging on one of the wings. Then it was all downhill from there. Poor character development, lack of chemistry and a familiar plot pretty much did this film in. Let's put it this way. If Black Widow had been released first instead of Iron Man, no way the other Marvel films would've been made."
2007,8,"Great Send-Off Top-Notch solo outing from Scar, and a perfect intro for Scar-Jo 2.0 in Florence Pugh! The other characters in the movie were perfectly cast as well with David Harbour crushing his outing as Red Guardian! Great movie is overall!!"
2008,7,"Her character deserved so much more This would have been a decent second instalment in a Black Widow trilogy. But I think this is all we get. Natasha had so much potential with her back story and character development, this movie was so shallow. So much material to work with in her training, deflecting to SHIELD, her mysterious connection with Clint and Budapest. As a fan, I'm a little heartbroken that I didn't get to see the history that Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, Thor, even Bruce Banner got to experience on screen. Dear Marvel Studios, women can be complex, unattractive (gasp) characters too."
2009,8,"Funny Entertaining Movie For you comic book fan boys... STICK to the COMIC BOOKSTORE.This was a funny entertaining movie, Pugh and Harbour are outstanding supporting cast. I look forward to seelng Yelena's story arc. Pugh was great, perfect for this role."
2010,4,"The worst of the Marvel movies Weak story, weak villians and they ruined Taskmaster, one of the coolest villians from the comics. Found the action scenes boring and the kids lost interest and went on their tablets. The future of Marvel movies is looking pretty dismal."
2011,4,"Boring, awefull, Saw the movie yesterday. Didn't expect the movie to he this boring. Exactly opposite of the trailer. I expected this movie to be in line with the vibe of Winter soldier. What I got was a crappy version. Not enough action sequences. Story line was very slow. Not the way I wanted Black widow saga to end. She deserves a much better movie. After all she sacrificed herself 😂😂😂"
2012,7,"better than expected It was better than I expected (especially after suffering through in-theater trailers for movies I have no interest in seeing). Florence Pugh's performance was noteworthy, and I look forward to seeing even more in the future! I just wish this movie had been made/released sooner - it seemed a little bit out of order compared to the other MCU films."
2013,8,"Scarlett Johansson as Executive Producer = amazing I would normally rate this an 8/10, but it currently being a 7/10 on IMDb after its opening weekend is absurd. People reviewing that could not follow it either have never seen Captain America: Civil War (and to a lesser extent, Age of Ultron), or didn't actually watch the movie with their full attention. It was easy to follow.I loved that Black Widow had her own movie...especially without a love interest. It was great to see the main relationships were familial and accurate, funny dialogue reflected that.I thought this movie was easy to follow. It took us on a trip of one of the many lives Natasha lived and her noble desire to do good. Scarlett Johansson was an executive producer and I felt like her choices were wonderful. Her character wasn't sexualized and the women kicked butt in this movie.Maybe there's haters because apparently when it's a bunch of men fighting, it's kosher, but not when it's women?I hope women superhero movies become more the norm. This is and Captain Marvel (which I thought was not as great, but most origin stories aren't) show that us women will watch an action movie and feel empowered even if it doesn't fit the mold of a rom com."
2014,7,"Fun, but a little disappointing For what it's worth, 'Black Widow' was a fun and exciting action movie with a fairly interesting story. For all the time Marvel had to put this film together, the editing and CG seemed to be a little messy, and the plot was kind of 'meh' and filled with some predictable turns throughout. Hence, I was somewhat disappointed as 'Black Widow' really had the potential to be one of Marvel's best (ever) movies, and yet did not meet my expectations. Although I have to admit that my (and many others') expectations were probably too high, after waiting so long for a new Marvel film (nearly 2 years) and with all the hype that's been building up. Overall, I enjoyed Black Widow but left the movie wanting more and felt like it (and its producers, director, etc.) didn't quite live up to the billing."
2015,3,"I truly believe the MCU should've stopped after Endgame. I went in to this movie with pretty much no expectations, and I was still disappointed. Plain and simple this movie is poor. I was hearing from reviews this movie was gritty and real, spoiler alert: It's not. Virtually no gripping storyline, poor dialogue, and desperate CGI action scenes. This movie continues to stray me away from interest in the MCU."
2016,6,Good but could've been better I liked the film but I'm sad that there was so much more to be told about black widow and this is what they decided to go with. The villains of the film were bad. The story was average. The performances by the cast were great. Worth a watch and remember to stay for the end credits.
2017,10,Phenomenal!!! Enjoyed this movie so much it has been amazing to watch a Marvel movie since the pandemic I'm very happy with the film! 💯🕷👍🏻
2018,10,nice I enjoyed it very much. I dont get why ppl are being so negative.
2019,7,"WATCH WITHOUT EXPECTATIONS..... Don't give much expectations to this movie. Then only feel comfort after watching this movie. The story of the Movie is about ""THE WOMEN'S WHO ARE ALONE IN THE SOCIETY WITHOUT THEIR FAMILY. SUCH TYPE OF WOMEN'S ARE KIDNAPPED BY PERSON WHO LOST HIS DAUGHTER IN A BOMB BLAST. HE OPERATE THE BRAINS OF WOMEN'S AND KEEP A MICRO CHIP IN THEIR BRAIN SO THAT HE CAN CONTROL THEM TO DO CRIMES. HE CREATES A RED ROOM' I THINK THERE WILL BE A SECOND PART FOR THIS MOVIE . BECAUSE THE MOVIE END IN A SUSPENCE "" OVERALL GREAT MOVIE..."
2020,10,"its a marvel action film what did you want? I don't know why people didn't like this movie, like, what did you expect? Drama and deep stories with plot twists? Its an action movie based on a comic book.. its a good marvel movie, not the best, but id give it a 10 because its exactly what i came for."
2021,9,"ONE OF THE BEST Even the beginning had me on the edge of my seat, it was suspenseful, tense and emotional. The acting was perfect. Even the comedy was on point, it didn't feel forced or inappropriate. Each character was developed correctly, they had flaws and even good, unique traits. The pacing wasn't too fast or too slow. The choreography was outstanding and each hit felt like it hurt. The action and the effects were amazing. The music and the beauty and aesthetic of it was just beautiful. I noticed a lot of people were saying the villain was underdeveloped and barely seen and I have to agree but other than that it was pretty good. I don't give out 10 stars a lot but I really loved this film. It may just be my new favorite. I recommend ."
2022,2,Highly Disappointed Was Obsessed With Seeing This Movie Since The Trailer First Dropped Almost 2 Years Ago. The Storyline Was Very Underdeveloped. Felt More Like A Cheesy Sitcom Then A Marvel Movie. Scarlett Didn't Seem Like The Lead. The Action & Fighting Sequences Were Rushed And Brief. They Definitely Didn't Develop This Movie Correctly. Had Alot Of Potential. But Very Underdeveloped. Not A Good Movie At All. I Wanted To Walk Out Of The Theater After The First 35 Minutes.
2023,4,"Another run-of-the-mill stinker. Kinda the norm with these movies And you know what? I expected it to be another thing, dunno why. Even when it's Marvel and it is always the same god-damned thing, with Natasha Romanoff I thought they could pull it off as a simple but effective action movie. Too bad nothing of that was given to me. What I got was a senseless plot, a pretentious dialogue wanting to belong to a family drama but failing and a CGI so bad it almost killed the movie by itself. For example, there's a scene a helicopter falls and crushes to the ground, as a pathetic attempt of making humor (hey, Marvel's trademark there). But how the hell do you pretend to be funny when the helicopter looks fake as hell and has CGI effects all over it? Come on, that was pitiful dude. When even the CGI is against you, you know you are in big trouble. Then, one of the main plot points of this movie are feromones. Yes, you heard right. And that plot point appears magically as a plot device in the moment to create some conflict, so it's completely stupid. The action sometimes is kinda interesting, I give the movie some credit for that, but the movie is way too long and way too talky, and in the end, for what? Just make a straightforward action movie Marvel, ok? Is that so hard? By the way, I don't wanna talk about the post credit scene, is one of the worst ass-pulls after credits I've ever seen. 4/10."
2024,10,"Great movie, it adds a lot of development to Black Widow as a character Black Widow has always been sort of a distant sidekick of the Avenger Team, seeing as how she and Hawkeye are the only ones without some extraordinary superpowers or technology. But Hawkeye has his special arrows which add a lot of utility, Black Widow was... more of a Hulk tamer.In this film we can see how Black Widow softens the situation with ""heart"", albeit to sort of an exaggerated degree. Not to mention, some of the plot twists were overly-simplistic.Regardless, the story progression, dialogue, action, special effects and so on are one of the best in recent times, even after I have watched recent blockbusters like F9, The Tomorrow War and The Hitman Wife's Bodyguard, which have plenty of great acting, special effects and overall content as well.I would say this film redeems Black Widow as an Avenger."
2025,8,"Where's the love? I don't get the hate of this movie from the negative reviews - personally, I loved it! Great mix of character development, action, humor, human moments, and an intriguing plot. Ignore the hate - give it a go!"
2026,10,"Funny and good send off for Natasha As a non-comic book reader, i LOVED this film. Having a sister myself, I appreciated the banter between Nat and Yelena. Everyone in my theater laughed throughout the movie. It was nice to watch a marvel movie about someone without superhuman gifts. A lot of action with some heartfelt moments. I would've liked to know more about Natasha's defect and Budapest, but it seemed like they wanted to use this movie more to set up Yelena's future (looking forward to seeing her more). Overall, I enjoyed this send off for Natasha and I can't wait to buy the movie."
2027,7,"An extreme review of Black Widow My rating of Black Widow is probably more extreme than the average person's rating would be. I first saw her in Iron Man 2, and when I saw the trailers for the first Avengers film I was so excited to finally see her in action again, and not just in one or two brief scenes. A solo film on her part, where she really is the star, finally feels like a possibility now. In fact, after seeing this trailer, I'm actually more excited for this Avengers film than I am for Infinity War.I liked Black Widow, and the fact that there's just so much space for her to work without too many constraints. You see the writing there, and you see her working without exposition or dialogue. It's all just visual. I thought it was great. 5, I think the original Silver Age - Iron Man. Here's where your list truly starts to get crazy. Marvel regularly recycles characters and concepts for their main lineup. This is something I learned a long time ago. It goes like this: Marvel and DC will generally do a ""one, two, three"" thing - DC will use a character for a period.If I were to rank Black Widow out of 10, I'd give it a solid 6.5. The movie is about her and her relationships, even if the conflict between the two is out of focus at the very start. Black Widow, the sidekick, is not an exemplar in the evolution of a hero. She was not born into the role, and her character development is not the primary focus. These days she's a strong action-movie character, and she rocks the majority of her fights. Most of her interactions with Steve Rogers, Iron Man, or other heroes are fleeting or muted."
2028,4,"Disappointing and forgettable In the grand scheme of the MCU, this movie feels really pointless. I couldn't tell you what this movie was about, or what happened in it, it was that forgettable. Please don't pay $30 to watch this movie, it is absolutely not worth it."
2029,3,"Look how they massacred my boy, Taskmaster Yes, the Taskmaster twist in Black Widow fits the themes of the film, but they still CHOSE to adapt a known character for the sake of fan appeal and completely butcher them. All they had to do was not make the character Taskmaster in the first place, so the criticism is valid."
2030,3,"Worst Marvel Movie This movie looks like it cost a lot.But it was horribly, horribly written. And I rarely notice that in a movie.Other than Yelena, this movie was a total dud."
2031,10,"Marvel takes a turn for the better This movie was well worth the wait for Black Widow to have her own movie. Action packed, humorous, and full of heart. Natasha has always been one of the strongest characters in the MCU and this movie adds more to the legend that is Black Widow. I will definitely miss seeing more of Scarlett Johansson in this role but if this is it what a fine send off it was. Feels a bit more mature and darker than the rest of the MCU and this was much needed, something to ally different and boy was it worth it. I hope Marvel continues to make different movies like it. More character, darker tone, new challenges, and a wonderful experience. See it for yourself, in Dolby or IMAX if you can."
2032,7,"The Fourth Stage After seeing Wandavision and Falcon&Winger Soldier, The story of Black Widow is definitely more compacted and substantial compared to the tv series. I have to admit, marvel movies just can't disappoint you. As the first film of the Fourth Stage, Black Widow retells the story of Natasha after Captain America 3, when she went on a run and obliterated the Red Room with her original ""family"". Since Natasha doesn't have superhuman abilities, the movie contains a huge amount of short-range combats and mirror-like dual that are intense to watch. Also, Natasha's family are introduced to the marvel universe, all played by skillful actor and actresses who provided the audience with laughter and resonance. The mystique of Red Room and Taskmaster is unveiled in Black Widow as well, as we get to see Natasha finally eradicating the fear of her origin. The only downsides I could think of are the heroes invincibility regarding car crashes and plane wrecks, and the confusing fragility of the antidotes. (broken by a punch yet surviving the plane crash?) If the movie would've make the widows volunteer as cold blood killers and spies instead of controlled puppets, and because of Natasha's kindness and sympathy they are salvaged, the ending would've been better. Marvel fans, Black Widow will not disappoint you as a unique and different superhero movie."
2033,6,"ONE TIME WATCH, IF YOU HAVE TIME; I am disappointed as heck. The story despite having potential is so underwhelming and boring. The story is very basic, with little imagination. The acting was good but everyone except David Harbour and Florence Phew were so dry the action was so simplistic and Basic and misses the Marvel excitement to action scenes. The action scenes felt forced.. the comedy fell flat. They absolutely ruined many characters in this movie few characters are useless. The screen time for the villain is very less and they barely even explained what the character genuinely even was. Also I feel like they could delete the first 45-60 minutes of the movie with little to no consequences. This movie is so bad that it can't be a tribute to Black Widow.I am giving 7 stars because I get to see Scarlett Johansson playing as Black Widow for last time."
2034,1,"What was the point....... I had hoped this would be a decent addition to the MCU that would finally flesh out Black Widow and answer some of the many questions about her past, especially what went down in Budapest but alas, it was a forlorn hope and in the end it turns out to be another boring, generic woke piece of rubbish from Disney.Why make a Black Widow film, if she wasn't going to be the main focus, it sort of defeated the whole purpose and was a massive disservice to what Johansson had done with the character up to that point, instead stumpy Florence Pugh gets the limelight, I presume because she is going to be in the Hawkeye tv series judging by the end scene they slotted in.Really don't waste your money or time with this pointless enterprise."
2035,6,"Was it worth the wait? The release was delayed numerous times, it starts off well with a significant amount of back story and development. Than falls into the same Marvel formulaic storytelling and 'quips'.Seems to have borrowed some strong elements from other MCU films, like the Winter Soldier predominantly. There is a strong cast here, which is let down by the average script. Once you take away the elaborate effects and sequences, is this truly the best send-off for one of the MCU's most beloved characters?Overall was little disappointed, but I suppose being the 94th film in MCEU, it would become formulaic and derivative by any standard. I certainly wouldn't pay the additional dollars to watch it on Disney+ Premier Access."
2036,7,"Okay, but nothing special I'm so looking forward to this movie, it turns out it's not what I had in mind. But I think the fighting scenes are good, the acting is good, the story's easy to understand, a little slow in the middle of the movie because of the big talk at family reunions, I might not come back to watch this movie. But after looking at the credit scene, I was thinking, ""There must be another story after this movie."" And I can't wait for that."
2037,4,"Disappointed - not good at all I'm kinda disappointed with this movie, I love the Marvel movies and this has to be by far the worst movie of them all.. I'm a fan of Black widow however the movie didn't hold up as well as I thought.There was no flow no plot.. Task master was good but very small amount of screen time.Action was forced but wasn't enough of it.. couldn't tell if they wanted this to be a serious movie or an action movie either way if wasn't one or the other.Wouldn't watch this again.. that's for sure."
2038,6,"Spectacular yes, but not what I expected... The first half hour was below average. After that it was ok. The timeline was not very clear. The second half of the movie was spectacular."
2039,8,Black Widow Black Widow is a good MCU movie I feel like if this was released during when civil war came out it would have worked a lot better Black Widow is about Natasha is on the run while the taskmaster is trying to get more of the widows alright so Black Widow is a good movie but the ending did not feel right when Melina captures Natasha Yelena and red guardian I am confused but than they change their outfits to make it work but it feels off when they did that like when Dreykov touches their head it changes people I really did not like that but after that it got better so Taskmaster to me was great until they reveal who was taskmaster sucked it was the daughter of Dreykov that sucked the first 15 minutes of the movie was awesome I liked the pacing of it Yelena is a great character as the sister of Natasha so all round a good MCU movie with a great supporting cast with a different story so I give Black Widow an B.
2040,9,"Story, action and a... family vibe! First of- really fun movie to watch! Not a dull moment. This action comic book based movie has more drama, than a a drama movie! And it's mixed with an array of great fighting scenes and pretty mind blowing visuals. It's got a fair mix of humor, perhaps some plot holes and whatever else. And it's fun to watch, no doubt. A pleasant surprise indeed!"
2041,9,"Worth the wait but a little predictable Black Widow was everything you expect from a MCU entry: lots of action, a few heartwarming moments and the answers to a few questions (though you might have forgotten you wanted to know after waiting so long!) If you are a true fan of the MCU, this is worth the walk down memory lane with Natasha and her ""family""."
2042,4,"Terrible Disappointment This movie was a terrible disappointment nothing like the winter soldier or Thor.It was a disaster. The plot did not make sense, fighting scenes with no sense, I feel sorry for the cast who was given such poor material. The direction was awful. Black widow deserved better ...I wish the Russo Brothers worked on it, but unfortunately they did not.Personally I watched it jsut cause I'm a big Marvel fan and like most them I wanted to see this movie and judge it for myself, so even if it does well at the box office, it doesn't mean the movie was good.Terrible - save your money and don't go if you can."
2043,10,Ignore the negative critics Another example of critics not liking and fans having fun. Over the top action. Fun story. If all marvel kept this going we would be good. No politics just fun comic book action.
2044,7,"Simply Released Too Late Overall I enjoyed the story, characters and action of the film, but I think it was just released too late to have a major impact. They should have made and released this film where it takes place between Civil War and Infinity War.With it being released now it brings up questions such as how she ended up with Captain America at the start of Infinity War when she surrenders to Ross at the end of this movie, as well as why didn't we see the Red Guardian, Taskmaster and a small army of Widows fighting alongside the Avengers in Endgame.Lots of positive reasons to watch this show,, the only thing I really wish they wouldn't have done is try to address what happened in Budapest. It was much more exciting and mysterious prior to this movie and they should have left it alone.. I just think it left a few more questions than what it answered."
2045,7,"Entertaining and fun but with some problems Based on the reviews I have seen before watching the movie, I had put my expectations low but tbh, it turned better than what I thought I would face.The starting scenes were good. It showed a brief backstory for Nat and I was fine with it. Then the movie starts and well I don't wanna go into more details in order to keep this review spoiler free :)The acting was fine, the writing could have been done better, dialogues sometimes felt off and I can't lie that I'm disappointed in what taskmaster turned out to be. Still I liked the main villain.As I said, it was an enjoyable movie and I liked some scenes (especially the family gathering ones). The action scenes were good but in my opinion there was too many of them and some of them were pointless and kinda predictable. The post credit scene was something I expected to see and I'm happy it was included in the movie.I feel like if this movie was released after civil war and not in phase 4, it would have been so much better so the ending wouldn't be that predictable but still, I say it is worth watching once. You shouldn't expect a very deep or emotional story. As a prequal movie, you will probably like it. But let me just tell you if you are a comic fan, taskmaster will definitely disappoint you so prepare yourself for anything."
2046,10,Good action scenes and acting performance Things marvel lacks is good solo movies and this movie fulfilled that. Quite a side stoey premise shows much information and backstory of a very important character in the avengers franchise. People just couldn't take a female lead and movie with female roles. Reviews shows patriarchy at its finest.Great CGI and great plot definitely worth a Watch. The best part of the movie is the acting performance of the main cast. They did great overall. Quite interesting new characters and powerful one's too. Shows the vast potential of the comics. Overall recommended to everyone.
2047,8,Only fake Dolby Atmos here like at 2/3 of all Atmos movies. Otherwise quiet nice. Only fake Dolby Atmos here like at 2/3 of all Atmos movies. Otherwise quiet nice.
2048,1,Save your money .... Worst marvel movie....ever. I wish i would have checked comments before throwing my money to the garbage...
2049,7,"Not bad not great, just meh... Not bad not great, just meh... Florence P does an excellent job though, she deserves to have an stand alone movie."
2050,10,"Don't listen, the mob loves to hate. This movie is among Marvel's best, undeniably. It holds true to its extended universe, elevating Marvel's tradition of exceptional visual presentation coupled with a new, highly effective ""spy movie"" format. This film is a wonderful ride, beginning to end. It sends off Natasha beautifully, with excellent work from Scarlett and a particularly shining performance by Florence Pugh. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz are also delightful. Marvel is back and they've brought much more to look forward to!(P. S i would give it an 8/10 in reality but I'm doing my part to counter act the over reactors)"
2051,10,"Great story, funny, action, visual effects Black Widow didn't disappoint. It's as good as Captain Marvel but fun and funnier. TBH I wasn't sure about the Johansen and Pugh tandem would work out but surprisingly it did. Most of all I love that it wasn't trying too hard to be something bigger than other MCU movies - this was seamless and perfect. Also the end credits got me really excited. Thank you Marvel! My note is 10/10To all the negative reviews and trolls - stop watching movies on your phones.P. S. If you want to know what Black Widow's sister will do, she will soon appear in the Disney + Hawkeye series. And to stop all those with negative comments if you still can't think for yourself or give stupid reasons to hate a good movie, check out The Canadian Lad for more details on other marvel movies and series maybe if you explain them you'll understand better."
2052,10,"Enjoyable I really like this movie, although deseves more . Black widow is an incredible character, I love the meaning of this movie, I think it is súperior of many marvel movies like Ironman and more."
2053,10,Black Widow delivers This is a great movie! Marvel you out done yourself. Finally. Natasha gets her film! Outstanding.
2054,9,"Surprised if low ratings. Good film! It's nice to get a break from the super natural I think. Clearly not everyone agrees but I can get satiated with super powers and magical stones sometimes. This film was a nice good bye to Scarlett and her character while also delivering great cgi, action and a pretty good story.Florence Pugh / Yelena is a great addition to the marvel scene! She had some great moments and made for a few good chuckles with her lines. Can't wait for her return in upcoming Marvel films."
2055,7,"Not as bad as reported My most trusted movie reviewers seem to dislike this film a lot more than I did. Sure it is formularic with some ridiculous plot armor on the protagonists, but has many positives. The action is tight, the pacing is reasonable, and the acting by Florence Pugh and David Harbour are top notch. The complaints that Taskmaster was disserviced doesn't resonate with me as a non-comic reader, but I feel for those that had a poor portrayal of their beloved character.Overall, the movie is fine to watch in theatres if you can look past some glaring plot holes and silly final moments."
2056,10,Marvel writers get it right every time! The back story is wonderfully sad. Every moment draws you in while you learn of where her strength came from. Black Widow has always been my my favorite character. About time she got her own movie....makes me hopeful for the reassembling of the avengers.
2057,8,"Satisfied with what they gave us Do not go to the movies expecting to watch a masterpiece. With that said, this is most definitely an enjoyable movies that had its funny moments and some spectacular action scenes and special effects. The last 20 minutes was phenomenal, and worthy of a marvel movie.However, the only issue I had with the movie was the fact the russian accent was poorly imitated by American actors. Except that, everything else was smooth, and I can definitely state that I had a blast watching this film."
2058,8,"Solid - if a little late Regardless of timing, I was looking forward to seeing ScarJo dig into the Black Widow backstory we've all wanted to see. IMO, her portrayal of BW has been at the heart of what's made marvel films click together so well, she was always the glue that held the guys together - which is why I've been irritated that it's taken this long to get a stand-alone movie. But I won't continue to harp on that...What we find here is a movie with a surprising amount of heart. Johansson and Pugh have great chemistry together on screen - indeed Pugh seems to be a worthy successor of the Black Widow title in future films. They family dynamic that has developed in the film was surprising in a good way, I loved the way each character is shown yearning for something good in their life, only to realize they had it together, for however a brief amount of time it was. One thing I love about Black Widow is she's always seeking redemption for the tough cases and for those around her she cares about, and it pays off here with her family.Is it a great ""Marvel"" movie? No, it's not what it could have been had it been released 4 or 5 years ago and had more involvement from the other main characters. Considering what she's contributed to the franchise as a whole, ScarJo deserved at least a cameo or two from one of the guys.But is it a ""good"" movie? IMO, yes. It has a heart and a compelling story of its own merit. Watch it and let it be what it is."
2059,7,"Okay Marvel Movie It's a pretty good Marvel Movie, which means you see all the things you expect to see in a Marvel Movie. This movie would have been a lot better if it has been placed between Civil War and Infinity War, where it takes place chronologically, instead of after Endgame, when you already know how Black Widow dies.That said, the basic plot is that Natasha Romanov discovers the top secret Soviet program to make female assassins is still running, after finding her former sister, who has just escaped from the program.Whacky hijinks ensue, with some pretty good action sequences. And, yes, they actually are self-aware. What is this woman with no powers doing on a team with a Space God and a guy in an Iron battle suit?Still, it does a lot to expand on the character and Johansen is very engaging in the role. If you are looking for a film to break the stress of the lockdown, this is definitely it."
2060,6,"Black Widow´s family what?! Marvel Phase 4 begins with a rocky start, concocting a very generic movie in all the sense of the word.It´s an overall uninspired production, from the script to the cinematography, it reminds me of Stallones typical vehicle movies from the 90´s but with Black Widow, and surprise, surprise... the 90´s are long gone. It´s a movie that feels like they pieced together several ideas and add a story later just like in a check list. Exotic locals? Check! High speed car chase? Right! Generic evil organization? Check!Boring Disney factory movie, reatreading of ideas and themes with zero creativity."
2061,5,"Maybe the only non Marvel fan review IMO this movie is very generic, over hyped and underwhelming.The only purpose this movie serves is to have Natasha pass off the Black Widow torch to her sister and they waste 2 hours doing so and in that time give us a few seconds of dialogue in reference to what happened between Hawkeye and Black Widow in Budapest before this movie takes place (after 10 years hyping it up with constant references).The action scenes are all super generic as is the dialogue and pacing, also to call the movie predictable would be an understatement.If you've seen a few of the trailers you've seen the majority of content the movie has to offer and can save yourself 2 wasted hours by skipping this and are better off waiting for The Eternals, Venom 2 and Spiderman No Way Home."
2062,10,Amazing movie! I loved every second of this movie. I really enjoyed the back story they gave Black Widow. I don't read or follow comic so I am an easier audience to please I suppose. In my opinion this movie should be getting a much higher rating! I can't wait to buy it on DVD.
2063,7,"7 The film's vot nothing except for Rachel Weisz 's acting,"
2064,10,very good film Nice to see bit of the back story to black widow. Cannot wait to see more of this story line.
2065,8,"Fun movie, people are really overhating it Ik had a fun time watching the movie. I liked the plot, the time and characters, especailly Florence Pugh as Yelena. I understand why people don't like the Taskmasker twist, but I think it really fits the story. I think there is still hope for a new Taskmasker, because the mask still lies on the ground when Ross came.(I really liked the opening credits)"
2066,5,"The Wait Has Come After Two Years!!! I saw this film Thursday night at an early showing, so this was my first film i ever saw before opening night. I was super anticipated for a new marvel film to be back in theaters! Black Widow had all the action, the drama, the quips, it had it all. The characters were endearing, especially Red Guardian. And Natasha's sister. Yelena who were great additions to the universe. My only gripes with this film that is kinda consensus with everyone else is that this film should of came out 5 years ago, but honestly it does set possibility for the future and tying lose ends to the marvel universe before phase 4 it does a great job. Taskmaster is cool, not the best marvel villain but works for the film it is in! For sure a good time in theaters!"
2067,5,Not Worth The Anticipation For all the hype the movie hasn't amouted to much. Probably the worst of the current batch of Avenger movies. I've never been impressed with Scarlett Johansson as black widow and her role in this confirmed my feeling.It's a shame Emily Blunt couldn't do the part. I think she would have been much better. Even Ray Winstone wasn't very impressive in his role. A big disappointment all round.
2068,1,Worst movie of the marvel What should i say movie is too slow. I dont know why marvel made this movie now bad screen play waste of money expected more.If u want to see the movie keep your expectations low.
2069,10,Simply amazing From start to finish captivating and broadens Black Widow's journey massivelyTHIS is why I missed going to the cinema.
2070,1,Taskmaster issue It was more like wasted potential.Everything was just meh. Because it's the 25th marvel and it's just soo late for the party. Also can you guys stop gender swapping characters #Taskmaster #SaveQuickSilver #SaveTaskMaster #BLACKWIDOW.
2071,9,"Functional hair styles for the win You can tell this movie was directed by a woman because for once, the hair/make up/outfits are functional for bad guy fighting. Nothing boils my blood harder than when a woman is out kicking butt and trucking across the wilderness in full hair and make up as if that makes any sense for the story line or character development. This movie did a great job of depicting complicated feminine characters that were inspirational in each of their own ways to real women rather than to fulfill a fantasy. Very impressive fight sequences and overall solid storyline. It's about time we had this film and I'm excited for the follow ups."
2072,7,A good but not great This film i thought was an amazing but at the same time when i look back to other films i think how those did better but still this is amazing.
2073,6,Not good... Movie was not needed and it should have been a Hawkeye team up....boring and lame.... Black Widow isn't an original avenger. Widow is a lame and weak character...where is my Hulk smash...hell Hulk could have been in it. Kevin Has got to go....
2074,10,This is the movie to see Black Widow is definitely a must see movie if you're going to see this in person it was totally awesome everyone should love this movie.
2075,10,Good enough It was so good especially action scene's but story wasn't enough.
2076,10,"This might be my favorite superhero ""origin"" movie I don't understand people who dislike this movie. It has a few rushed parts and the villain is very forgetable, but other than that it is brilliantly acted, charged with emotion and simply fun. Fights are very well orchestrated. The soundtrack is amazing and I enjoyed the nods to Russian culture as a Russian person. This movie was very dark but not overly dramatic and the comedy felt natural. Pugh might be my new favorite actress, she was even better than Johannson. If she is the new Avenger, I'm totally onboard.Also as a woman I gotta say I enjoyed this movie more than any other female led superhero movie of this decade. I believed in the women that were portrayed on the screen, I believed they were real people with real feelings, flaws, conflicts, friendships, etc. Not a Mary Sue eye candy as Wonder Woman, not a robot as Captain Marvel. I for once actually felt empowered watching female superheroes.Well done, Marvel. I think this movie deserves at least an 8, but given the undeserved hate it is getting, and just for Pugh, I'm giving it a 10."
2077,3,Lame... This has got to be the most stupid Marvel movie to date. Great CGI however poor acting and a childish storyline that made me roll my eyes over and over again.
2078,7,"Marvel is (more or less) back What a long time we have waited or ScarJo to get her own solo movie. Black Widow has been in Marvel movies since 'Iron Man 2' in 2010, and while all the other founding avengers got origin stories, and sequels, Natasha Romanoff has even been pipped to first Marvel female-led movie by Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, never mind having J-Law & co do a Black Widow movie in all but name with 'Red Sparrow'.Maybe this is not the place to go over the executive misogyny and perceptions about what or would not ""sell"" that led to this situation but, watching this, one cannot help but remember this is not the next in a series of ongoing Black Widow adventures, but instead a belated salute to one of the MCU's key characters.In that sense, we can be pleased this exists, and that progress has been made, but we can also acknowledge how bloody long it has taken, and hope for more in the future.The movie then has a multiple missions; to serve as a kind-of origin story for the Black Widow, to give her a final send-off, to introduce us to characters who will continue to appear in the MCU (notably Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova), and maybe also comment on how women have been used by men to serve their interests for a very long time. All while delivering on the expected superhero action.It's a lot for any movie to accomplish and 'Black Widow' does some elements better than others.The script is by Jac Schaeffer (who created 'WandaVision') and Eric Pearson (who co-wrote 'Thor: Ragnarok', and who worked on the under-seen 'Agent Carter' tv series which also looked at the Red Room.)Romanoff is a spy by training. Spies (at least in the popular imagination) operate in murky, trust-no-one, shadows that take a toll not just professionally, but on their personal life. In the most recent 'Black Widow' solo comic series, Mark Waid embraced this side of her character, sending her on a series of impossible lone missions in which she had to heart-breakingly betray those closest to her for the greater good.The MCU has in the past alluded to Romanoff's need to atone for the red in her ledger, and the fact that she defected to America and SHIELD from Russia. We might imagine then that she wouldn't have many friends left in that part of the world. Given we know her ultimate fate in 'Avengers: Endgame', the movie wants to lift some of those burdens from Natasha's shoulders and assure her (and us) that she was loved, giving us some retrospective comfort about her sacrifice. To give her that, this movie is actually about Natasha putting her old family back together and reclaiming her place as a surrogate daughter and sister. She's does this to take down the still-operational Red Room in which kidnapped children are turned into mind-controlled deadly assassins.Putting the band back together is a well-worn movie trope and it works brilliantly here with Florence Pugh proving continuing the phenomenal hot streak she has been following 'Fighting With My Family', 'Midsommar' and 'Little Women'. She goes toe-to-toe with Johansson in the action scenes, and has great fun with her in the downtime between punches.David Harbour provides many laughs as Alexei AKA the Red Guardian - Russia's answer to Captain America. Harbour takes an insecure braggart who can't say the right thing and turns him into a decent guy who discovered too late what was important.The problem with all this is that it leaves Natasha sharing the limelight in her own movie. Where we could have had a fuller account and insight into what makes Natasha the Black Widow, we instead spend a lot of time understanding the wounded, bitterness of Yelena, and the out-to-pasture history of Rachel Weisz's under-written Melina.There's a definite feeling that if this movie had come ten years ago, it would have focused more tightly on Natasha and her history with the Red Room, but now, the MCU has more to think about, and the multiple missions can't all be fulfilled even in the two and a quarter hour runtime.Marvel is a well honed machine when it comes to action. From early on the film drops us into action, and it rarely lets up. From Norway to Budapest and on into Russia, there are one-on-one duels, car chases, aerial escapes and shoot-outs aplenty. They are all done with the usual level of breath-taking CGI, stunt work, and quips. I had only seen one previous film of director Cate Shortland - her debut feature, 'Somersault'. That is a lovely, touching piece of work about a girl trying to find her place in the world but it didn't prepare me for the level of mayhem in this movie. What is recognisable is her concern for the difficulty for a woman of trying to find her place in the world, and the importance of a decent support system.The evil villain's (played with a nice snarl by Ray Winstone) plot is woefully undercooked. He's manipulating countless women but his ultimate plan is a very vague, off-the-peg ""world domination"". His deadly right-hand, Taskmaster, is similarly underserved.It's admirable to want to allude to women breaking free of the control of monstrous men but when the method of that breaking free is a near magical red dust, it undercuts the work and effort it takes for women to actually get out from under either the literal trauma of an abuser, or the more pervasive patriarchal culture.By the end, 'Black Widow' has achieved a little of all the missions it set itself but had not truly completed any of them. A modest success then. Something that was enjoyable and a pleasure to see on the big screen but not the all-out storming of the cinemas we had wanted for Scarlett.Random thoughts: * First time back in an Imax screen post-pandemic - it was great to have those awesome visuals and sounds wrap around us once again.* There was at least one gratuitous butt shot, and I don't know how to feel about that in a film about female empowerment.* Loved the cheeky snippet of 'Moonraker'. Another movie about a spy facing a world-conquering villain but which is even more ridiculous than this one.* Speaking of Bond, Olga Kurylenko provides another connection as she had a big role in 'Quantum of Solace' * I know all action movies engage in a level of suspension of disbelief but there is a car crash in this in which Natasha's car roof is practically caved in as the car is bounced about, but she runs out as if it weren't no thing.* The Red Guardian was Russia's answer to Captain America and they sent him on an undercover mission for three years???!!! Hmmm.* If the Red Room is in Russia, how the hell is General Ross zipping about there in a very large, very not-secret convoy???* And speaking of General Ross, why even bother showing him towards the end if you're going to hand wave away what happened next with a ""two weeks later""?* That post-credits scene did a lot of work - pushing the narrative forward by five-ish years, shedding some tears for Natasha, teasing the Contessa, and setting up the forthcoming 'Hawkeye'.* I love Marvel and I will go to see everything they put out from here until it all falls down, but I continue to be impressed by the level of care and craft that goes into making all of these movies and tv shows, and occasionally uniting them into one sweeping story. It really hasn't been done before on this scale in movies and tv and Kevin Feige has really got the secret sauce."
2079,8,"Succeeded on purpose I am surprised why people are downgrading this movie. I had personally limited expectation from it because she is already dead. I was only trying to find ""what actually happened in Budapêst?"". It is good that the movie tried made us focus more on Yelena and of course she is more to look on future MCU development. That's why the movie succeeded on its purpose."
2080,4,"Beyond cartoonish Entertaining but the script is mediocre (even for this movie genre). The comedy relief characters are laughable stereotypes poorly executed.Some scenes between Florence and Scarlett are enjoyable, they do have chemistry. Florence character usually takes the spotlight.Also, CGI does not have the same quality of other movies in the MCU franchise."
2081,4,"pointless This movie had nothing to offer other than just expanding the marvel universe. So if you're not really keen on keeping up with every marvel detail, this movie is quite hollow. Apart from being a marvel movie, this is just another plain formulaic action movie.4/10: its a yikes for me."
2082,5,Alright It was alright. That's about all I can say. Yelina was great and really carried it for me. Also enjoyed David Harbours character. However the story was slow and the Taskmaster twist was disappointing.
2083,9,"Black Widow Great movie , only problem I had was the wasted potential of taskmaster , I wish they would've went by the comics with Tony masters but I do understand their explaining the past with Natasha , don't get me wrong taskmaster was great through out the movie , but the reveal to me , was a little disappointing but that's the only problem I have with this movie."
2084,7,"GOOD FUN AND FANTASTIC VISUALS! This movie was a good summer blockbuster that kept me entertained! Stunning visuals and amazing practical effects.The only thing that kept subtracting my score on the movie would be David Harbor's character and their take on the new villain, Taskmaster which i thought was a big letdown.Other than that a good movie with solid performances all around from the cast!👍"
2085,1,"Why? Wtf us this atrocious fast and furious woke Garbage marvel? This really bad imma give 1 for some action,1 for David harbour and 1 for being a marvel fan."
2086,7,"Out of all the MCU's movies, I'd say this one is easily the worst. There were so many problems with the film that made it such a bad film. Most of the film felt like a low-end superhero show and the actors looked like they were all bored to death.The plot in the film was basically just like any other superhero show, bad guy gets un-brainwashed, sends message to old buddies/family, they work through their differences, get together and end up throwing some sort of explosive device in the last possible second to the bad guys and that's it. Characters end up in the rubble and say goodbye to each other and part ways. The only difference in this movie was that the characters were mainly women, but that's about it. We didn't even get to see Red Guardian at his full potential and taking any fight seriously as he did in the comics.We didn't even get to see Red Guardian's shield, which many of us expected to see as he is Russia's Captain America. Taskmaster wasn't even a hard villain to beat and all comic fans know that Taskmaster is a damn-near impossible to kill bad guy. I mean Taskmaster literally knows how to fights just like Captain America, Black Panther, Spider-Man, you name it. And for Nat to just beat her like that? Also the fact that all widows are trained exactly like Black Widow and are unable to beat her altogether in a scene, is sad. Not that I wanna see her beat, it's just that it doesn't make logical sense and Natasha should've not been able to survive more than a few seconds in that office on her own. It shows that just like many low-end superhero movies and TV shows, the main character is always outclassed to the point where they're stronger, faster, lighter, and more agile than the people that literally trained with them. Taskmaster's costume also sucked, nothing compared to comics Taskmaster. I was honestly expecting so much more out of taskmaster and now that character is ruined in the MCU forever. The trailer made the movie look almighty good when it really wasn't."
2087,8,why the bad reviews..... This movie gives you why mix up a human with a gun among superheros....her skill set bought her to the avengers and to be honest now i want to see a movie with Hawk....... And yes Pugh took the movie over.....but you got to know black widow dont like the spotlight but be for real who doesnt like to see NAT do her scissor clamp to the head and then finish with those eyes.......it is so sexy....and for the critics that say she is not a box office puller then why are you writing reviews because i beg to differ...maybe nat is dead but the ingenius mcu brings us little sis.....DO YOUR THING GIRL...
2088,10,Could've been better but i love it I love the subtle message about men contollerd women's body. It's a sin for marvel not to put Winter soldier ( Bucky Barnes) in Black widow storyline.
2089,3,"Why was this movie made? 99% of the time, the IMBD movie ratings are spot on. At the time of writing this, this movie is ranked 7.2. This is mind boggling.Worst Marvel movie ever. Plot was dumb af. Movie felt like it was filmed by an Indie director and crew. I took note of the director so I can make sure to never watch her movies ever again.Do yourself a favor and skip this one. I know it's compelling to try and watch ""all the marvel movies"" but this one can be easily skipped. Adds no depth to the universe."
2090,5,"Another villain ruined Taskmaster, one of Marvel's best villains is forever changed as a result of Marvel's need to fit characters into their ""vision"" (pun intended) of reality rather than sticking to the cannon. Why is a mutant with photographic reflexes turned into a computerized program? Obviously down the road some armor wars tie-in will occur. Yet why? In the comics, Taskmaster singlehandedly defeated the Avengers because of his abilities and skill yet now he is an automaton programmed by watching TV to learn his skills. I wonder if Marvel catches the real meaning: is society programmed by watching TV or social media and then acting accordingly? That is subject to individual reflection and perception.Other than that, Black Widow and cast were wasted on what could, and should, have been a tour de force rather than the intended prologue to the next Avengers team. No doubt Hawkeye will most likely meet a similar fate."
2091,10,"Not the best but worth the wait. Loved it, a little slow here and there. But the acting is superb. They blew it with continuity, first thing was the car chase, the car is clearly scratched getting out of the parking lot then the whole chase it's fine lol. Could've used 1 or 2 more Avengers, Black Widow is best as apart of a team IMHO. Scarlett Johansson can carry a film, she and Pugh carried this one. Definitely a welcome addition to the saga."
2092,10,"I loved it! I loved it! Natasha has always been my favorite. It's so nice finally seeing her in a solo film. Great acting, plot and visuals. Scarlett and Florence are a great combo!"
2093,2,"A Dull Afterthought This movie gave me 'The Last Jedi' vibes - a movie full on hollow conflict and convoluted story that essentially sets out to waste enough time to keep you busy until the finale.The active villain was overpowered, had a ridiculous and mostly nonsensical origin story, and just didn't offer the connection that we've loved with previous MCU villains.Nothing about this movie really made that much sense, including the accents.Scarlett Johansson's Romanoff came across as a caricature of her former self. And while David Harbour and Rachel Weisz played their roles well, it's only really Florence Pugh who stood out in her role.You could honestly skip this movie and it wouldn't remotely limit your enjoyment of the MCU."
2094,5,"That's not how we wanted to say goodbye to Natasha, not that! I hope the fashion for women directors who make films about women will pass and faster because it goes badly and this is a problem for the Marvel universe, let's see what happens in The Eternals, which seems to me also a failure with beautiful graphics and inappropriate jokes! In short, the film is bad, that is, not interesting, stupid, clichéd, the heroes will always be on the defensive and are not in danger, the fights are weak due to the quick frame changes, I almost had an epileptic seizure, although I am NOT an epileptic, the villain is a typical Weinstein, there is no music, a very lazy film, as if a neural network had invented it, in recent years Marvel Studio has not even tried, at first stupid Endgame, then Captain Marvel and now a widow, it's a pity !!!"
2095,5,"Complete waste of talent How are you going to bring David Harbour into the marvel universe, make him a super soldier, and give him absolutely nothing to do? His only purpose was to bring black widow and her sister to the mother. That was literally it. We didn't even get a badass fight scene. I won't go into my other complaints, like how they ruined the taskmaster character."
2096,5,"Black Lucy Black widow doesn't like Marvel movies. It has good action movie, but very weak screen play. I assumed that movie would picture that how Natasha turn to black widow, but to my astonishment actually movies started within civil war. Script has very flat jokes like Natasha's father compare himself to Capitan America. Black widow is an avenger but she looks very naïve compare to her sister. The movie doesn't have a logical rhythm, sometimes so fast and sometimes very slow. It is enjoyable movie but not in th class of marvel's."
2097,4,"Super Disjointed and Weird It tries to be a Deadpool-like comedy, while trying to be some sort of political, female drama. They even added a transgender looking kid that is supposed to be Black Widow.They really hate Fathers in this one.The special effects are subpar for a Marvel film. This should have been a mini series, not a movie. There are some great moments between the Sisters and the Dad, but it's almost ruined by the too-fast pace.It's actually better in some ways and a lot worse than DC's ""Captain Marvel."" It does have some funny moments."
2098,10,Great Love Scarlett. Marvel is too Disney. Natasha's dad is weird and unconfortable.
2099,1,"Disappointing as ever Before disney took over Marvel the Marvel name used to guarantee a phenomenal movie experience. Black widow was nowhere near phenomenal, it was much closer to mediocre or garbage, an absolute insane amount of unnecessary dialogue, uncreative story and theme, tacky villains, and AWFUL acting. Half way through the movie I just got on my phone and watched YouTube because Black Widow was more of a children's movie than an action movie. I hope Disney goes under for this one. I've spent better money on tourist trap gifts than this abomination. This ones for Disney:🖕🏼🖕🏼:"
2100,7,"Cinema Omnivore - Black Widow (2021) 7.1/10 ""As per Marvel's standard (and deep pockets), BLACK WIDOW's extravagant FX is consistently engaging if singularity never emerges (every time when the dust settles, it leaves an ecocide no one cares), crisply coordinated action sequences are slick in motion but uneventful in impact, Natasha is not superhuman, still she can defy gravity, survive grievous car crushes and take haymakers without batting her eyelids, blood at the corner of her mouth is the maximal damage violence can incur to meet our eyes. In the main, BLACK WIDOW is a predictable joyride of thrills and chills, but most crucially, it contests the male dominance of adrenaline driven entertainment, with a preponderance of women in action, it sets an eloquence case no sane person can confute.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks."
2101,10,"Amazing! Don't let the negative reviews fool you. This was an amazing movie just wished we could have gotten it sooner. We finally get a better idea of her past. And we see how big the Black Widow program is in the world. Definitely not your typical stand alone but considering it's a flashback type movie that was delayed multiple times, it's definitely worth seeing. Saw it twice and can't wait to see it again!"
2102,8,"Better than I expected I've been waiting for this movie and got really excited when I saw it. Pretty good action movie with some serious parts which includes the background of Natasha.Florence Pugh as Yelena is awesome. We'll see more of this young lady in the future for sure!The only downside was The Taskmaster. That character was quite lame imo.The movie has its flaws, but over all it's pretty good."
2103,8,"A solid marvel movie I don't know why people are hating this film so much as it has got a lot of good stuff in it. The fight scenes are amazing and the humour is also really well done. All the characters seemed well developed and the villain, while his final goal isn't great, is definitely a villain due to the way he treats others.I like the way the intro of the film was confusing until you understood the story fully, as you believe Natasha and her family are the good guys but as it turns out they weren't. Seeing how little Alexi cares for the family as he found it so boring really made him an interesting character and I liked his progression throughout the film, also him wanting to relive his glory days was a nice touch. I also think that yelena worked really well with him as she saw that time as the best she'd every had, this contrast made for some good character.Overall the film isn't the best in the world and some stuff is weird, but the characters are all great and the plot is also really solid. I would highly recommend this to anyone even if your jot that excited for it as neither was I. Overall a 8/10."
2104,8,"Good, but was it worth the wait? To be honest, I wasn't expecting Black Widow to be what it was. However, I was fine with it. The bridge fight and the Budapest sequences were stellar, although I found the skydiving scene a bit unrealistic with the poor CGI. I enjoyed the fact that they didn't have any powers (Alexei barely used his) and resorted to interesting combat sequences. Pugh did a great job in this film along with Harbor. The comedy and emotional points were pinned perfectly at the best times. The theme of family was a unique and emotional choice that I enjoyed. Also I have to add the ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" Cover is amazing. However as a big Taskmaster enthusiast, I was pretty disappointed with what they did to her. In the comics, Tony Masters has a lot of character, one they didn't go into in this movie. I would have liked to see more character development in Taskmaster. Besides that, I thought it was a good movie and in my opinion was worth waiting for."
2105,8,"Florence Pugh stole the show (or movie* lol) So many people here seems so disappointed but i can say that i'm glad i'm enjoyed this one, especially because of Florence Pugh's performance."
2106,1,Just Bad I feel like I just watched two hours of fight scenes and no real character or plot development. I left the theater asking myself what I just payed to watch. Wrost thing Marvel has put out.
2107,1,"Taskmaster is a man Disney. Learn to respect Stan Lee's work and don't try to alterate it with your unnecessary politically correctness. Taskmaster is a man, not a woman, god damn it!"
2108,10,I loved ittttt Amazing movie!!!! A lot of action and so good fight performance. Emocional and funny too. Go watch Black Widow folks.
2109,6,"Unnecessary but entertaining I've just seen this & honestly, it's ok. It's a standard run, jump & blow stuff up film. It's hard to watch a film about a character that you know is **SPOILER ALERT** already dead the stakes just do t seem high at all. Ray Winstone has a bad accent, great seeing Rachel Weiss she's a great actress (did you know she's married to Daniel Craig) the cameras were jerky. The choreography & cinematography though were incredible. It's made me want to visit Norway if nothing else.Who was this Red Soilder or whatever he was called? Where did that super serum come from? I spent half the film wondering whether her mate was Craig David & the other half laughing to myself wondering why did the bad guy looked like Lord Z from Power Rangers?Honestly this seemed like a two hour fight fest just to explain a haircut & a plane."
2110,6,"Average standalone at best Her sister stole the show and honestly made me see how boring and bland Black Widow is as a character. This movie without her sister would have been a 5/10. Black Widow also does a lot of impossible physical feats that just made me annoyed. Overall it was a decent movie, but Marvel is going downhill since endgame and I believe it will continue to do so."
2111,3,Average It was kind of boring. I would have liked to have seen how they developed the young Natasha and Yelena into Widows. We only get their present angst and disdain of their past.The lighter moments were few and not very entertaining. None of the characters could deliver the funny line.The fight scenes which dominated the movie were pretty good but the story just didn't appeal to me. So I think all action and superhero junkies will find something to like here but its just temporary high. The movie is very forgettable.
2112,8,"A really good marvel film, perfect balance and good characters I don't quite understand the hate towards this film, there are a few flaws that you could point out but personally I loved this film, definitely one of my top 5. I loved the characters, the dark backstories make the last act of the film very impactful and it also makes the dining table scene really emotional, additionally with Florence Pugh's performance. The fight scenes are really good and very fitting for the superheroes with no powers, the last big fight wasn't as good as the others. The villain was such a good villain. Would definitely reccomend watching!"
2113,7,"Great Origin Story...but not the one advertised One of the better Marvel movies so not sure why some are rating it very low. I'd love to see the ones who rated this as a 2 or a 3 and then see what they rated Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World or Captain Marvel.I was skeptical of Black Widow movie especially since she died in Endgame so at this point who cares but this movie is not really about Black Widow Natasha Romanov as it's an origin story for new character and characters so this works. What I really like about this movie is the fact that it's vastly different from the trailer and from expectations.This is an origin story for Yelena and her future in MCU. Natasha Romanov is merely a sidekick here or a vehicle to introduce Yelena to the audience and this is her movie with Natasha simply being the name that puts butts in the seats."
2114,6,"Average at best This is your typical Marvel movie, nothing too special here. Should have came out years ago and really feels like a filler film during this pandemic marvel film drought. They completely waste Taskmaster and the actual main villain was generic. Story aside there were some entertaining action sequences with some great (and iffy) CGI that comes standard with Marvel movies. As far as what it adds to the overall MCU it only indroduces and handful of new characters that could appear in the future and has minimal setup for an upcoming project. I was able to see this for free and personally I wouldn't have paid to see it."
2115,6,"2021 it's ok, back in 2017 it would have been better (probably) I only watched this to see what it added to the MCU, I wasn't excited to see it but was optimistic about it adding to what we already knew about the character.I'm glad it's not an out and out 'superhero' movie because Black Widow isn't a superhero so they were right in the setting of the movie but it was too light weight and it didn't feel like she was the star of her own movie.The supporting cast was a mixed bag. I liked Florence Pugh as she did deadly killer/little sister very well, Olga Kurylenko needn't have been in it, Ray Winston (who I love usually) was an odd choice and was under used, Rachel Weisz seemed bored and David Harbour did well with what he was given but was basically an idiot.The story was fine, if a little silly and the first half was a lot better than the second half.Overall, it was an entertaining (if not gripping) way to spend a couple of hours and feel that if it was released 4 or 5 years ago then it would have had the benefit of the MCU hype but as this is now in essence a stand alone movie it was very average."
2116,4,"Nowhere Movie This movie was average. It plodded along without developing any characters very well. I struggle to remember anything from it even though I watched it only 12 hours ago. They had a great story to build on, the transition from cold blooded killer to hero with a conscience. But they did nothing in that area, opting to go with some dysfunctional Guardians-esque band of motely misfits called a family. They didn't explore the built in story about being Russian interlopers at all. They didn't explore sister relationships at all. The didn't explore the toll it takes on children and spies in a foreign land. No intrigue.It felt like a mashup of Bourne, Matrix, Guardians, and general Marvel-ness, which in the end made the movie feel like a begrudged shout out 7 years late. Like when you skip a ride your kid wants to take and spend all day at the park. Exhausted and hungry as you start leaving after 8 hours, you remember you promised your kid you'd go on the ride. So you zombie walk 1.4 miles across the park to the ride and don't really enjoy it but at least get to say you did it. That was this movie."
2117,3,"The only originally in this film comes from Ray Winstone's wandering accent. The story idea for this could've been good but the writing and pacing of the film just let it down.The 'characters' weren't there at all, nobody was likeable or interesting and the dialogue was awful throughout. The only character with any kind of development was David Harbour, but when your comic relief is a better thought out character and has more charisma than your lead then you have a problem.There was no drama or any sense of risk in the film, not only do you not care about the characters but you know whatever happens to them physically they'll just get back up and carry on. The action set pieces were fine but at times the editing didn't seem to make sense and characters started to do something and then in the next shot they are back where they were before. It all felt a bit slap dash and half hearted. In a sea of bad Russian accents though Ray Winstone does shine and deserves special mention.There is nothing even remotely original here, overall it feels like a knock off Marvel movie with better effects. I think this is the problem when you commit to this kind of production line of films and interlinked TV shows, things become more about making product than making a good film."
2118,8,"GREAT movie! GREAT movie and action together with a good story, enjoyed the movie every minute of it."
2119,6,"The weakest Marvel movie Regardless of great stunt performances and action sequences, Black Widow's fast pace and unusually cringy and cheesy dialogue lowered this movie to plain mediocrity. Florence Pugh outshined Scarlett Johansson a bit, while Harbour and Weisz weren't that memorable. Also much anticipated Taskmaster was completely wasted and so was the appearance of Olga Kurylenko. His interesting ""power"" of mimic could have been used much more effectively, but they barely scratched it and just skipped right over it. Lorne Balfe's soundtracks lifted movie's scenes with its cold and eerily melodies. It is clear that Black Widow should have come out years ago and was only made to satisfy strenuous fans that have been constantly asking for it. Because of its irrelavency for the MCU timeline (except for the Florence Pugh's caracter), it shouldn't be focused on and fussed aboutfor too long."
2120,3,"So boring, that I didn't manage to reach the end ot the opening credits. Man, this movie is so generic (meaning, identical to thousands of others) that I could actually predict every single scene. 10 minutes on this are too much, time it's better spent cleaning the bathroom."
2121,6,"Could be better but it's just fine Fight scenes are awesome and the rest, huge chunk of the middle portion is extremely boring. It made me pause 3 times and come back to finish it."
2122,8,Scarlett Johansson eyes What happen Scarlett Johansson eyes in the poster.
2123,8,"A beautiful emotional movie Such a beautiful movie.black widow is the ""logan"" of mcu i think.an emotionally charged beautiful movie.although it was a prequel and nat was already dead,the story was interesting.florence pugh's performance was great too."
2124,1,"Disappointing Switched it of after 20 minutes, boring with boring characters."
2125,7,"Was disappointed about Taskmaster I was very exited for Black Widow and I was enjoying it, until they barely used my favorite villain in the marvel universe. Taskmaster is so unique, and they missed an opportunity to make him a very useful villain. He had two fight scenes. TWO! Other than barely using their villain, this movie was good. If your a marvel fan, (like myself) you will enjoy yourself. But if you are like me and love Taskmaster then you will be disappointed that this movie barely used their villain."
2126,3,Too much joke that doesn't necessary Waiting for a long time this movie .But I'm so disappointed .Why so many joke ?It's supposed to be an action packed movie with a beautiful sexy Natasha .
2127,4,Super-soldier serum power of female version The movie is about the smartest agents but no wisdom in scripts. All I can see is that they seemly have Super-soldier serum power and action without smart plans. The villain is so simple and easy to be defeated. Very disappointed!
2128,5,MIXED FEELINGS Movie is not too good not bad either one time watch that's it . I think director doesn't give much attention to widow and their focus on action scenes which are impressive but movie need strong storyline of black widows . Story is straight forward not much twist and drama .
2129,4,"sleep 3 times, talkative drama, safe to fast forward You can fast forward sleepy talkative drama useless conversation.You can Fast forward all actions too. Young sister is fat. Old actress and Mom."
2130,7,strong first half In my oppinion they should have gone with the spy-theme in the entire movie instead of turning it into a cgi avengers movie in the end.
2131,10,Movie was good don't listen to the haters I love the movie and action and the humor i haven't seen a movie in a while that made me feel like this.
2132,10,"Spot on - a lot of action, good fight scenes Not sure what the poor reviewers were watching, must be some other film.Very good film, action packed."
2133,4,Something's Wrong in Marvelland First Falcon and WS and now this. Avengers needs editors who can help make movies more interesting. Can't believe I pid 30$ for premier access and can't believe a movie with Scarlett Johansson can be so boring/ dreary.
2134,10,"NOT WHAT WAS EXPECTED! Okay, Let me get to the point!The Movie was good, Story was simple, Action sequences were awesome, Acting was awesome but again the problem come with the VILLIAN😐.It was just not what we expect from TASKMASTER!Why we not got to see the full fight between Red Guardian and TASKMASTER?And really, When I got to know in the movie that who's the TASKMASTER, I was like : NoooooooooBut if you know the ending, probably we could get to see more of TASKMASTER or Those widows from the Red Room and from Melina and Alexei and yelena!And the Post credit scene : 😳 Wow that was not at all expected.So, I hope that we could get to see someone else as The New TASKMASTER."
2135,8,"It's NOT a bad movie. People may not agree with me when I say this movie had great action sequences, amazing acting and a decent plot, but it is true.I think the movie lacked a bit direction. At certain points I felt the story move too quickly to process.I highly recommend to watch this movie, it's not as epic or as hyped as previous Marvel movies, but it is a good movie in itself.Definitely worth watching."
2136,10,"Very Nice Goodbye To Black Widow I was really disappointed when they decided to release Black Widow to Disney+ too, because for me every MCU movie is made for theaters, so i don't care how much i'm enjoying watching Black Widow at home, i still wish watching this movie on theaters, Black Widow fills with a no doubt great performance by Scarlett Johansson, added with Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz amazing performance too, the movie fills with some really great action, great score, and an amazing choreography, Black Widow is a very very nice goodbye to Black Widow."
2137,5,"I really wanted to like it I was really looking forward for this movie but it ended up being a complete disappointment. The story just didn't live up to the expectations and they missed the whole point of making a movie about Natasha. Rather than giving a proper send off/ character development story to Natasha they made a complete movie about a villian that didn't even matter to the rest of the MCU.Natasha's sister Yelena had more important dialog in this movie and felt like Natasha was the side kick here. And whole part about Natasha and Melina using face transfers to fool Dreykov was just a bad stunt as anyone with a brain can clearly see the body and height changes of these 2 women, after that point I completely lost interest in the movie."
2138,7,I liked it but could have been better I didn't dislike the movie and it was enjoyable. BUT I would have loved for it to be magnificent as this is a movie about Black Widow. I think we all can agree that this movie should have come out a long time ago and the story could have been much better. Would have loved to see more about Natasha's past!
2139,6,"Another standard Marvel movie. Black Widow new Marvel movie recounting the past of an iconic character inside the MCU. The film is very average, I didn't like it very much, it has a shallow and little explored script and some fight scenes have so many cuts that it gets confusing. The movie isn't completely bad, you can have fun watching it and there are things that can be used in future movies. Overall the film is weak."
2140,8,"Some awesome action, beautiful cinematography, and an enjoyable cast I am really surprised by all of the negative reviews. A case of too much hype? Regardless, I hardly think this movie deserves to be torn apart.The action sequences in this film were intricate and awesome. I do wish that they would've toned it down a little. Since Natasha doesn't have super powers, some of it was pretty unbelievable that she could get up again. But I had a lot of fun during the action scenes.I loved the cinematography and production. The cast also did a great job, Pugh was pretty standout. But Scarlet did a great job playing a more vulnerable version of Natasha. She's on the run away from her Avenger family and back facing the man who ruined her entire life. She's not smug or putting on a show for Tony and the gang. I thought she was excellent.I will agree with some complaints that the villain aspect of this could've been stronger. It did sometimes feel like they were fighting a ghost due to the lack of scenes he was physically in.Overall I think the over-hype has sadly been this film's enemy. It's still a good, enjoyable installation to the MCU."
2141,3,"Mediocre I was quite excited for a Black Widow movie. An avengers movie with a whole different take .. dabbling less in the good vs. Evil - and more in the grey area, where the goals justify the means.But what did i get. A movie that satisfied the ""summer blockbuster"" requirements .. in a bad way. A flat story with fairly one dimensional characters (what a crime! .. a black widow movie with one dimensional characters!!) - a story that offered good vs. Evil .. and a protagonist that showed very little conflict when it came to ""doing what needs to be done .. or does it?""One also often says that a hero is only as good as the villain .. and this villain was - boring. Boring and unsurprising. The villain was not even a villain! (that is a villain that has his agenda that the viewer can understand)Maybe the problem is that there is little more than Thanos for Marvel at that time. It is hard to ""escalate"" from a point where half the universes´ population was exterminated.All in all, i was very disappointed with the movie. It was not ""boring"" per se .. but it felt like a lazy effort at best."
2142,6,"Mediocre at best, a far cry from the usual MARVEL quality movies So many flaws and faults, almost unbearable. What kept me entertained, were the action pieces and the dysfunctional family dynamics. Also, one star for the casting of Florence Pugh who did a far better job than Scarlett. This movie has absolutely no MARVEL feeling to it. No wonder when you start messing around with source material. A great villain in Taskmaster ruined. Please keep to the source material and stop making everything about diversity and gender equality. The comics are the holy grail, so please hire writers and directors accordingly. 6 out 10 stats."
2143,9,"Great movie!! Action packed, great story, and just really well done!"
2144,8,The movie is very entertaining. Watch it. Everyone is a harsh movie reviewer now-a-days. The movie is a nice action movie. My friend and I enjoyed it in the movie theater. I'm glad we went.
2145,7,We Needed this movie sooner!! Pugh was amazing oh my god she carried this film wasnt ment really a black widow movie but still taskmaster was very disappointing but the other was amazing Defo would recommend.
2146,4,"HARD TO FILL THE BOOTS After Figthing a titan, it became clear the next marvel movie will have big shoes to fill.Black widow, wasn't it, black widow should have been another Disney+ 3part seriesAt least have one episode introducing the family The next episode introducing the new black widow and then a final episode of Natasha and her quest.After watching the movie I kept wondering who was the black widow.Was the villain even necessary.I'm glad I watched the other serieses otherwise the cutscene would have felt weird like how thanos changed appearance in every cutscene."
2147,10,"One of the best MCU movies The movie is amazing! Definitely worth to watch in the cinema!First, let's talk about the opening credits, the song, and the flashbacks from the red room were fire, it gave me chills.Next, the action scenes, one of the bests of all MCU.Also Scarlett and Florence's connection in the movie, one of the best I've ever seen, they looked like they had met 10 years ago, just like the others. Scarlett never stops surprising with her amazing acting skills, but Florence carried her character like no one else, it so fun and amazing to watch her play Yelena.The taskmaster story was not so developed but it made sense.I also liked the fact that they talked about important matters such as human tracking, and women not having a choice on having kids or not.Last but not least, the extra scene, I do have to admit it gave me tears, but it was good to somehow close her story, and move Yelena deeper into the MCU.It was great to see Scarlett Johansson play Natasha Romanoff one more time!"
2148,3,Why bother? Unlike all the other avenger films I turned it off after 20 minutes because my take away food arrived. The next day i stuck it back on for a bit and then was distracted by a cat in my garden. The next day I thought I'd watch the rest of it and have just paused it to write this review. Not a good start to a film I was looking forward to. Too little too late.
2149,5,"High budget tv movie It felt more like a high budget tv movie. I enjoyed some of it, Florence Pugh's one-liners were good but her fight scene choreography was poor. Ray Winstone was a decent bad guy but his Russian accent was a let down. The movie itself was way too late and felt irrelevant knowing whats to come for the character."
2150,9,Can't believe what I watched... Best movie of this month And it's also contains some story of widows and red room so We love to explore mcu in deep and it's simpleness is so cute...
2151,6,"Endgame was not the End of MCEU and here's your proof. Black Window delivers a fulfilling action flick despite messy climax and MCEU's weakest character. Black Widow (2021) : Movie Review -It's been over 2 years now that we experienced the biggest superhero saga of all time through Marvel's Avengers : Endgame. Since that film some people really thought that now there would no more fun coming from MCEU but they were proven wrong with Spider Man : Far From Home. The makers had advantage of following the events after Endgame and so that Spidy flick came out really well, actually, even better than its predecessor. With Black Widow, MCEU has gone back to the time before Endgame amd Infinity War therefore the excitement of seeing something new was neve bulit up. Though, Marvel was smart enough to make a film on the character who had left the fans teary eyed so the sentimental back-up was there for sure. Thankfully, Black Widow is shaped well enough for the one time viewing even though it has made quite a mess out there with the weakest superhero present in the MCEU.Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront a conspiracy tied to her past. To be honest, Black Widow always looked the weakest in superheroes team because she doesn't hold any superpowers alongside HawkEye and so, having a film entirely carried by such a weak superhero was never meant to have a solid outcome. Of course, we aren't watching Christopher Nolan's Batman who had even less powers than RomanOff but Nolan is huge genius and that makes a big difference in the quality of filmmaking. Black Window kicks-off brilliantly and halfway through it surpasses all the normal expectations. But then it seems little dragged somewhere down the end and the overall excitement of solid content gets spoiled. But seriously before that dragging, it looked a fantastic film with superb action sequences and less use of larger-than-life explosion.Black Window is not a standalone film even with the characters of the film. If someone says that the lead superhero is sidekicked by a new character then you gotto agree. Performance wise, Scarlett Johansson is as good as she was in any Marvel film before but the real surprise here is Yelena. Florence Pugh plays this part and she looks hotter than Scarlett. Unfortunately, she didn't get as much action sequences as Scarlett or else she would have overshadowed her completely. David Harbour, Ray Winstone and Rachel Weisz are fine in whatever scenes they have got. The visual effects are not that great but the action sequences are. With technical aspects, Black Widow is neither dull not too good.The film do have some promising scenes that could stay with you for a while and it also have a good start given to HawkEye series we are gonna see in future. Cate Shortland's direction is worthy enough to make this flick one time watchable for fans and neutral audience as well. However, there was a scope for betterment which is surely wasted by the team. Overall, another action entertainer in MCEU that can be enjoyed by Fans as well as neutral movie lovers if they are not expecting something outstanding.RATING - 6.5/10*"
2152,10,Spetacular Perfect black widow. The action in this movie os incredible. Scaet is impecable.
2153,4,"sorry but for me a major let down Im not into the franchise in a big way, but as each movie is made and the budgets get bigger, i suppose we are always looking to be blown away with effects and such like, but i have to say, this wasnt great in my opinion, the Russian accents by some of the cast were awful, and the film wasnt entertaining in anyway, drawn out and slow!Sorry to upset the fans for this."
2154,5,"I expected better... I expected a great Marvel movie, but no, it was kinda boring, i feel disappointed..."
2155,7,"Not worth the wait, but still a good film. Florence Pugh carried the whole film on her back. David Harbour is always a fine actor to watch. They ruined Taskmaster for me. Black Widow looked like a side character even when it's her film. I guess Black Widow is just a side character material to me. But I hope to see more of Yelena. She is dope af."
2156,1,"Worst flick of the year We already know all BW does is pointless, but goddamn! This movie is so dull and boring i nearly fell asleep not 15 minutes in. The CGI-fest is unimpressive, there is no logic in what most of the characters do - taskmaster got ruined... If you need help falling asleep at night then watch this awful flick, you'll yawn your jaw off in no time.Worst movie of the year."
2157,6,Good but not at the best of Marvel Pretty much enjoyable . I would say this movie is good action movie but not at the best of Marvel.
2158,9,"Up there with Winter Soldier Great movie, worth the years of wait. Leaving the MCU formula (which is what I was hoping for for phase four since it's no longer needed due to the popularity of the MCU,) good writing with lots of heart, good combination of shots and scores, and awesome action sequences, which is what I thought would be lacking considering the director's experience, glad I was proven wrong. Excellent performance all around. Although still acceptable, Pugh is a bit chubby for the role, which is surprising seeing that Marvel always put the cast in a rigorous workout for their roles."
2159,9,"Great Action Thriller with a lot of heart! This was a great and entertaining movie that focuses on family especially the sister relationship. Don't buy into all the negativity. Go see it and judge for yourself. I have often found I don't agree with critics about movies, especially random people, and especially when the film is female lead."
2160,5,"Great acting, okay movie, bad plot, horrible soundtrack. I watched this movie a few days ago and hoped that it was just the first impact, I quickly realised that this was not the case. Lets start with the opening, I loved it, I thought Natasha's blue hair seemed strange but I could make my peace with it, the dialogue however... for some odd reason Yelena's mother was explaining the science of fireflies, again strange but I could ignore it, David Harbour was awesome, he was one of my favourite non MCU actors and I was excited when I heard he was casted for this role, after the fireflies incident everything about the introduction was great, it was suspenseful intense and was going great, until the over the top Deadpool 2 level credit sequence came by, I liked the Deadpool 2 sequence because it fit the character's theme and matched the over the top 4th wall breaking humour of the movie, but Black Widow isn't Deadpool, it was unbearable and hard to watch, the kids' acting was believable and kind of surprised me a bit. Then we move to the movie itself, the Civil War bit was entertaining and made sense since the movie takes place right after Civil War.Now lets get to the characters, Natasha for some reason seems very different than the way she was in any of the other movies, she always reminds herself and the audience that she was an Avenger and the other characters didn't help, the movie might as well had been called ""The Ex Avenger"" since it was mentioned more time than the fact she was a spy or that she's the Black Widow or the Villain. Speaking of, the Villain was awful and the Red Room was incredibly disappointing, I can only remember the names of 5 characters of the movie and one of those I can only remember their Super villain name ""task master"", her identity was really disappointing, I honestly enjoyed Captain Marvel several times more than any of the characters in this movie, that's including Natasha.The plot was predictable the lines sarcasm and lines were predictable as well. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 5 is because of the acting, with %40 of the movie being an awful plot %10 of the stuff being out of place and %50 being good acting that's my score for the movie. I honestly didn't enjoy this movie and if it wasn't for the fact it's a Marvel movie therefore some of it makes a little more sense I would give it a 3 or 4.Sorry for those who liked the movie, I'm happy you did but I personally didn't."
2161,1,"Bad movie, bad scenario, bad acting, just bad Black Widow is an important character in the Marvel universe, and then this movie pops out and you see how a bad production can be done in every way. So many over exaggerated scenes I guess they are in a competition with Fast and Furious hell, hollywood cliches, when driving a car with full action behind you, you still can make jokes, dull characters with poorly spoken russian accents, I really wonder why they have made this movie in the first place, a movie for 10-12 years old kids and I am sure they will be even get bored, don't waste your time by watching this thing called a movie, cause it is not, bad CGI is all you get as an extra."
2162,10,"Great film Excellent action movie, been a long time coming!Florence is going places since 'fighting in the family.' It's a shame we know the fate of Natasha in End Game, but anything in the Marvel universe can happen.This Movie as been said by many film review sites, has one of the best opening credit scenes of any Marvel Movie, watch it! It's so creepy and relevant to todays society of child trafficking and her initial red room training!I kept a close eye on this movie production for a while and boy did everybody got it completely wrong about the TaskMaster ...everybody I mean every body thought it was to be O. T. Fagbenle!. No body knew it was to be. Olga Kurylenk..... shows how miss-information can be spread!David Harbour, was the humour of the movie, Florence provided the great one liners, Scarlett gave a superb acting and action performance!I thought one of the best scenes of the movie was the 'family dinner reunion' in Melinas farm house. It was very funny, yet there was a great sadness to the characters and it was truly emotional.Florence Pugh literally stole the scene here and it was very emotional..Such a very simple scene at the dinner table can create a emotional stir within the context of the movie. It was very strong!Florence Pugh, gave a brilliant performance!Black Widow, is never really dead... Avengers'End Game'. Gave the clues away, in the time travel sequence!Just one question: where did the red room crash?"
2163,10,I don't understand the hate Honestly this film was incredible. It broke me in one too many ways. The choreography was outstanding. Overall it was very well thought out.
2164,5,Black Widow should've been a Disney+ TV show. This film was OK but I don't expect a Marvel movie to be just OK. I think the Black Widow character and associated characters from her past would be better suited to a Disney+ miniseries rather than a big budget movie. Definitely one of the weaker films in the MCU but still worth a watch if you're a regular cinema goer.
2165,1,"A real disappointment I've been waiting at least 10 years for a Black Widow movie and this was a complete mess. Once again they seem to have exhausted themselves with making their social justice moments, they had to copy another film to complete the story. This time they appear to have copied Captain America The Winder Soldier.A bit of a mess and a real shame."
2166,7,"Black Widow Finally gets her Own Action-Packed Film An enjoyable Marvel movie packed with loads of legendary action, fair story and the awesome superheroes. Scarlett Johansson takes the role as Black Widow, who is an epic Marvel protagonist without any superpowers. The fight sequences in the film are stylish and the movement is skilful, but the ""acceptable"" story can be flat at times. However, fans of Marvel action flicks will surely adore Black Widow, despite the fact that it took a while for the character to have her own film.The film delivers a promising opening with a nicely-produced title card and credits. Although it does feel quite long and extended, it's usually entertaining when the story approaches the explosions, gunfire and action. Even though Black Widow doesn't have any superpowers like most other Marvel heroes, the film still keeps a similar pace for Marvel fans.This action/adventure tale also just isn't as great as expected. Even though the acting and effects are stunning, it isn't a fast-moving film and is occasionally just uninteresting. Thanks to the performances, action and fairly constructed story, Black Widow is another decent cinema-worthy movie that'll impress those who adore the epic action stories that Marvel provides.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews."
2167,9,"DONT BeLIEVE THE NeGaTIVE REVIEWERS Its funny because so many are giving reviews of 1-3 stars but whats Suspicious is 90% of them have only reviewed just Black Widow movie or maybe 1 other movie.Watch it and judge for yourself.Im a life time marvel fan and though Taskmaster wasnt exactly like the comics at all but it shouldnt take away from the movie itself.Then theirs these guys all complaining about female empowerment movies LOL and when i check their reviews 2 of them reviewed Birds of Prey(Another female movie), captain Marvel (Female movie) and Black Widow with 1-2 Stars. Clearly they are upset women are getting more of a push, The funniest review i saw had someone complaining that it has men shown as evil pigs or whatever and thats why he hated the movie LoL but lets be real ?? In the comics 90% of the villains are males so what they cryin about.Another complained Black Widow wasnt using her beauty and Sexy charm to seduce n charm her enemies but like cmon you know how much backlash could occur if the directors went on that direction? Suddenly many would complain its sexist or such historical Manly views on women. Their trying to change things from the comics cause the comics was all written back then during a different era in how things were : Example being all characters mostly were white, or females with busty hourglass bodies dressed in revealing outfits, etc.Marvel and DC is now in a new era and thus their are kany changes from the comics."
2168,9,"Action, stunts, great acting, fun, heart, sisterhood and hope! The acting is great. Florence Pugh is a star. Great action and fun, and the characters have a heart and a mind. In the midst of all the traditional of the action movie, emotions and human lives are said and heard. We loved it. I will watch it again for sure!"
2169,7,DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS I got disappointed reading the reviews that i went to the movies feeling down! But the truth is the movie was enjoyable! And i love that they finally talked about how the world is taking advantage of young children's.
2170,4,"Bored. Guess I'm outgrown all the fond and excitement of watching MCU movies since Endgame. But then again, maybe it was because this movie right here was painfully just bad."
2171,9,This movie was Way better then i had thought it would be I didnt think it was gonna be that great since no powers and all so i expected a james bond type of movie but it was even better then bond movies. Sure no crazy gadgets but the action was amazing.They did an amazing job using such short time to build up the backstory of Natasha and Yelena and then the beginning intro credits they started flashing through many scenes/images that all connected to how the upbringing/emotional/mentality of both Of them. It was very effective thats for sure.It gives u all these emotions as u watch the flashing scenes which brings u a sense of understanding of what they may have went through or experienced.The chemistry between Yelena and Natasha was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it very much as well as the Red Guardian too.Many funny moments and insane action packed crazy stunt work.I use to think a marvel comics movie has to have powers for the lead character or it will suck but this movie has made me consider differently. Some might say but Punisher had no powers but the action scenes werent as good even though it was just a tv show while this is a movie.Overall this movie has made me excited to watch Shang Chi thats coming out soon because if they can make this movie with lead character with no powers so successful then that movie surely will be amazing too.I really hope they bring back black widow in the future because Scarlet Johansson is the best!! Maybe they may try to bring white widow to replace ? But either way i hope they do! Cause it wouldnt be avengers without a hero with no powers on the team (not to mention shes got a nice fit booty whoops i mean body ^_^
2172,7,"It's really good, don't listen to others This movie is really good, action-packed, spy, thriller and family. Florence Pugh nailed her character, loveable, childish, deadly, emotional. Others like Red Guardian and Melina also shine through the movie. But they made some bad decisions here and there, changing Task Master and releasing it post Endgame is one of them. They should had made this earlier in Phase 2. But it's worth watching."
2173,3,"This was barely a Marvel movie and the characters are a joke. If you look at Black Widow as an over the top action spy movie without all of the Marvel characters, then it's mediocre at best. When you take into account this is a Marvel movie and you know the characters, this becomes a disappointment. I don't want to put too much time into this review, so I'm just going to add my main issues. Spoilers ahead.1. The biggest issue in this is that they ruined Taskmaster. They turned the awesome character and origin of Anthony Masters (Taskmaster) into the story of a girl named ANTONIA who was caught in an explosion and turned into a mind controlled drone by her father. Taskmaster is now ruined in the MCU and can never join it properly unless they forget Black Widow. The only thing in this that is Taskmaster, is the name and the fact the character can mimic moves, which by itself isn't the true character.2. Apparently Black Widow is more human than other humans? I say it this way because she's constantly falling 50-100 feet and catching ledges, hitting fire escapes and hitting the ground and able to just walk away without a slight injury. I understand this is a comic book movie, but they just didn't care. Usually they go a little over the top with how much characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye can survive while keeping it somewhat close to reality. Not here. It's like the writers said, ""Okay, Black Widow can now take the same kinds of falls, hits, etc. As a super soldier, but she's human."" and left it at that.3. Red Guardian was pretty fun, but more of a bumbling buffoon. I'm not very familiar with him or his backstory, but it was like he was in there as comic relief instead of an actual character. I can't say they ruined him because I don't know enough about him, but after his introduction I expected big things and they kind of just his wasted potential.There are more, but personally my main issue is with gender swapping Taskmaster. Unfortunately this is something that Marvel is probably going to do with a lot of characters. If you are going to make a female version of a character, at least STICK TO THE ORIGIN! Don't just create a completely new character and say that's the character now, because it's ruined. You could have literally called the character Blademaster or something and it would be a character different from Taskmaster, thus saving one of the best mercenary marvel villain's in the MCU."
2174,1,"Clumsy, boring and disappointing Trash too bad of a plot , characters are all over the place no clear objective."
2175,3,Love Black Widow. But the movie is a suck fest. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars because Scarlett Johansson is in the movie.. For a marvel movie is it disappointing. I dozed off in the first half. Never knew there can so much dialogue in an Avengers movie. Felt like a documentary on Black Widow's life.
2176,9,I don't even like the Black Widow!...BUT I loved this movie!Realistic story-line and the dialogue had me chuckling all the way to the end!Enjoy and just let it happen! :))) 9/10.
2177,4,Terrible. Don't bother. Worst movie of the Avenger series. Story very weak. Action scenes far fetched.
2178,2,"The Personality of a Cardboard Box. Where do I begin? Ahh, yes. The beginning.A movie that never seems to get better as you keep watching, it very quickly becomes a MCU near carbon copy of every MCU movie made. There is nothing that sets it apart IMO. All the best action scenes are in the front half & best light moments are also you guessed it, in the front half. The acting is very bland, no heart as expected in these ""superhero"" movies. Apart from Pugh who was very solid all around. Black Widow is a very predictable movie that seems like it doesn't fit into the larger scale of the MCU. It seems it's a good way to get Scarlett Johansson into the MCU for a bigger role later on. Disappointing & boring. Some action scenes are good & well done. But save you money & watch it when it's on streaming sites instead of at the movies IMO. You wouldn't remember this movie in a few months time. If I could describe the movie in 1 word. Bland."
2179,6,"Chick flick This movie is another comic made into a movie, this time Black Widow, and as the movies there is no explanation of the story, you just have to guess what's going on. Widows are young women who assassinate important people in order of some organization. The Black Widow does not comply to this organization anymore and goes her own way, to even bring down that organization. The action, acting, directing, not top notch, but mediocre-good. Compared to the last chick flick, Wonder Woman 1984, this movie is a lot better, but still a struggle to get trough. The first half of the movie there is an overload of action scenes, but they are all the same, women who roll around the neck of an opponent to work them down to the floor, over and over again, like it's the only move they have ever learned. Then there is a homecoming scene that goes on for ever and ever, so boring. And then off course the boss level end-scene. My advise, if you have nothing else to watch or to do, you could give this movie a try, if you never see this movie, then you have missed out nothing."
2180,8,"More Florence Pugh and David Harbour please. They were amazing. I thought the movie was a lot of fun. Jason Bourne type action scenes. Family road trip humor. Set ups for future MCU content, and to top it off, we see one last famous black widow interrogation.The family dynamic humor is what I loved the most. The poser lines, sitting up straight, did he ask about me."
2181,7,"Pugh = Stella performance 10/10 just for her! After the horrific Wonder Woman experience I was worried this would be much the same and fall flat.I did, however enjoy this flick. It was nice to emerge myself in some super hero movie even just for a few hours.What a standout Pugh was in this film. Such a surprise and I'm now a fan.Weiz was a let down and could bearly hold a Russian accent. Why they cast her I've no idea?Scarlett still did a decent job. But, the man who played her 'father' (I do not know his name) was such a delight and gave another amazing performance.I was so into this movie for 3/4 but then lost abit of interest. Some awesome action scenes though and worth the effort."
2182,7,"Florence Pugh was the best actress I was waiting for Black Widow and yesterday I finally watched it. I expected something more from the movie: I didn't like the main villain (I'm not talking about Taskmaster), but the Red Guardian was so funny and I really liked him. Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson were amazing. This movie isn't one of the best MCU ones, but I liked it."
2183,2,"Disappointing, except Red Guardian After all the talk from Scarlett Johanneson, it was evident that she was over compensating for a bad movie. Kevin feigi has done better movies before. Heck, even the Loki series is better than this and it's a TV SHOW. Anyway, I liked Red Guardian. Big fan of him from Stranger Things... Hope to see him in season 4."
2184,3,"Great acting and awesome CGI drag it up to a 4/10. As expected with Marvel movies the CGI is awesome, and the casting is pretty great.However, as much as the cast try, the story is just wandering and uncoordinated.I found the acting really very compelling, but let down by a story that was very much meandering. It feels as if somebody wrote a story based on their own ideas and interests, but forced for a fictional world they don't really know, and tried to squash it in between a few impressions of said world.Anyway, my feeling is that this is a story about a character from the MCU which really drags them out into a different universe, feeling very much like a fan fiction."
2185,7,"Florence Pugh killed it! Yesterday I finally watched this movie. I was waiting for it and I liked it. I expected something more from the movie, I didn't like the main villain (I'm not talking about Taskmaster), but the Red Guardian was so funny, I really liked him. Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson were amazing. Black Widow isn't one of the best MCU movies, but I liked it."
2186,3,"Even the action scenes were BORING I feel a director needs to be a certain kind to take exciting characters in exciting situations and make it boring. From the family scenes to fighting scenes to any other scene in general, everything felt stretched out and quite simply, a bore. Except Black Widow's sister's performance which was the only bright spark in this 6 hour long movie, and someone tried to ruin even that by giving her that post credits forcing funny down the throat fiesta.Would I recommend it just as a weekend afternoon watch with nothing else to do? Hmmmm hard PASS."
2187,3,"I fell asleep I'm sure others will have liked this movie. Different strokes for different folks but , I have to say, the fight scenes were convoluted. There was no buy-in and it didn't seen like part of an overall story ""universe"", more like a standalone movie. Maybe I am the the wrong audience but a female empowerment movie shouldn't feel like it was made to be about female empowerment. I don't watch Iron Man and think he's great because he's a man, I think it's because it's a good movie and there's an exciting story. My kids may like it but I couldn't even make it through the whe story."
2188,7,"Good Good start, a bit boring middle,good ending.Everything what a movie should be.2 problems: 1 its a kind of james bind movie not so much marvel, may put some people off.2 its a standalone story, phases 1 to 3 were building up to avengers and then infinitywar but now were are getting loose story(with tiny hints of building up something with way less hype) and that puts off more people i think."
2189,2,Too late only for post credit scene This movie is tooo late it was come to phase 1 or Phase 2 only post credit scene was good and some action scene. They have to make strong villain and strong red guardian.
2190,8,"They did justice to Natasha The movie carried the same pace from the start to finish. It wasn't rushed or anything. The theme of the movie was known from the start. They also did great justice to Natasha. Both Scarlett and Florence Pugh did a great job in acting. There were few places that were out of place and unnecessary, logic less, but still this movie isn't as awful as people are making it to be. It's like every other marvel movie."
2191,6,Black Widow Vs Harvey Weinstein Describing the movie in one sentence:High budget fictional movie re-imagined in the Marvel Universe about Black Widow Vs Harvey Weinstein in order to take down his oppressive organization while passing the torch to a new Widow.
2192,8,A well deserved sendoff Not your typical marvel movie. It has a different tone to it. It was a good movie with a bit of slow pace.
2193,2,Boring and too much action I found it kind of boring with a lack of good story.
2194,1,Not worth the wait Very disappointed with this latest marvel solo adventure this has to be my most least liked mcu film right behind captain marvel.
2195,3,"Pretty sad it turned out this bad Spoilers!I watched the movie and then I looked at the overall rating which was really high to my surprise. I could honestly say it is the worst Marvel movie I have ever watched.The villain had some cool elements to her, but the helmet had some super unrealistic and unnecessary damage on the sides which threw me off. It honestly feels like they made it bad on purpuse, because of how close the shot of the helmet was. The jokes are super bland, but the only part of the movie where I laughed a little was when David Harbour thought he had an earpiece."
2196,7,"Cool fighting and action scenes! A good entry in the MCU, but would have been better suited if it were released right after Captain America: Civil War (for which it is a direct sequel that immediately follows it), since it was a little confusing putting myself back in the mindset of that MCU time period :-("
2197,7,"A bit disappointed. The actions are good and all, the story is ok, the cgi is a bit of a mess. Overall, it just feels different from the rest. I kinda missed how the phase 1-3 ""movies"" made me feel. I sure hope the Eternals and upcomming more will be much greater than this though."
2198,9,"Great movie! The story and plot of Black Widow felt exiting and engaging at all times and was very fast paced overall with the exception of some slowed down areas that implement some nice character development. The action was well choreographed and the jokes generally landed pretty well and we're quite funny. The soundtracks by Lorne Balfe was excellent and really helped to build tension. The cover of Smells like teen spirit during the opening credits is also amazing. The only complaint I have are with the villains. Taskmaster was a diabolically depicted and had more to do in the avengers video game. I felt like the reveal of their identity was lacklustre and I'm sure most people guessed who they were before it was revealed. Dreykov suffered from a lack of screen time but I felt like he was good in his scenes. The movie felt like it came too late and knowing how Natasha dies already takes away some of the tension as you know that she can't die. The new characters were great. The red guardian and Yelena. Overall, Black Widow is a great movie and I would highly recommend!"
2199,3,WASTE Waste of 2 hrs. Not worth waiting 1 year. Expected better storyline. Weak characters.
2200,8,"WOW!!! Black Widow really deserved her own Movie. And this was amazing!!! It's different from other marvel movies, and really worth to watch!"
2201,4,"Not upto Marvel Level. Quality of Story, ACTION, Cillian all below average. Injustice to Scarlet."
2202,5,"Prosaic dialogue The plot was weak, and we have seen much better actions for Natasha in other marvel's movies. In short, Natasha was a main character in avengers movies and she deserved better!"
2203,6,"Not as Bad as Most Reviews Will Make You Think. Yes, the movie is not one of the finest in the MCU but it is still enjoyable. It is not a movie that will get you sleeping while watching. Plus, it has some fun moments. I loved the opening theme song, which got me invested into it. I loved Yelena character and the fight scenes with Antonia were really good. Yes, they could have done much better but it is definitely worth watching. And given the quality of movies these days, I don't see why people are too harsh on black widow. Go watch it and be the judge."
2204,10,"A great movie Don't listen to the DC fans. This movie is one of the best ones I've seen since the pandemic started. You should definitely watch it. It is emotional, enjoyable and intense. It adds a lot to black widow's character and makes her death seem even more sorrowful. It is unjust that imdb only gave it a 7.1 when it clearly deserves higher. Read its reviews on other websites and they are much more positive. I think you should definitely give it a go."
2205,3,"I did not like this at all Yawn fest at best. Gave up caring after Uber distressing child exploitation at start of film. Awful characters who you don't care for particularly the child trafficking parents....Such a dark and depressing back story should never have been glorified or turned into a long, slow, depressing movie."
2206,10,HOPE 4 THE FUTURE!! YOOOOO THIS MOVIE SLAPPED!!! It had EVERYTHING!! It got dark but kept its humor well!!! DUDE I PRAY MARVEL MOVIES ALL START BEING THIS QUALITY!! I usually think they are just fun but I actually cared about the characters and the story. LIKE DANG!! The action was so entertaining and felt rawer and Ms. Romanoff got to be more of a PERSON?!?!?!! Obviously it wasnt all perfect but I am just glad that it was better then I expected and far more substantial then the 3 Ironman movies I sat thru cant believe I had to wait this long smh. No shade to Mr. Stark but god I'd give up all his movies all of Captain Americas and most of Thors for another one of these!!
2207,1,"Could have been better 2 hours of cringe, complete waste of time.Not only did it take a hundred years to get released, it took forever to get to the end of the movie.Terrible cgi, weak plot... c'mon, I could even tell how terrible the movie was going to be when I watched the trailer."
2208,6,director??????? I do not understand why Marvel continues to choose the worst directors.
2209,6,"I wrote a great long review, then turned my phone sideways... Anyway.I had a whole review typed and it got erased, but in hindsight I can just make it more brief.It's not as bad as the reviews say. Some actor perforneances made it stand out to me(Pugh+Harbour). The writing is not perfect but, its still better than most current 21' movies. As a big Marvel fan, its a bit underwheling but still not bad. Worth the watch."
2210,7,"Solid. Not the best Marvel movie, but not the worst. Had all the Marvel fixins. Great action! I sometimes like these more pedestrian movies from Marvel that don't involve too much of the ridiculous powers...for example Winter Solider. It's more realistic and this was that. Love the first half of the movie from the Ohio scene to the Budapest scene. The movie starts showing signs of fatigue when the whole family gets together at the pig farm. I also find it odd that this organization only focuses on female soliders."
2211,6,"I waited a year and a half for THIS? Don't get me wrong, it's pretty damn hard if not impossible to beat IW or End Game. There are other titles that are even really good like Civil War. This was not even close.The main complaint I have is the waste of a classic villain. Taskmaster's real name is Tony Masters, not the complete mess of a new character origin that they created for NO REASON. This has major Iron Man 3 vibes in a way with the Mandarin treatment. Not only did they needlessly butches a beloved Marvel character's identity but they're only in the movie for what feels like 10 minutes?! What even is this??? I get it, it's not Thanos but REALLY????Next on the list, we have the typical ""Trailer Syndrome"" where 90% of what you saw in the trailers was the best of the movie. There are a handful of decent scenes (action or not) that aren't crammed into the trailer, but ultimately what you saw is what you got. This again includes 90% of what little we see of Taskmaster, who I will remind you is NOT actually Taskmaster but a complete reinvention to fit the movie's narrative.Moving on with the issues we now have bad Russian accents. Draykov was good, very convincing performance and accent. Everyone else's? Trash. I'm sorry but it's true. It was almost comical. If you're going to have an Avengers spin-off with ""Russian roots"" then at least make the cast more convincingly Russian. It's almost like they all took Rosetta Stone for two weeks and said ""I got it!"" Harbour's is the worst, it's almost like he was just trying to be funny.Lastly I will leave you with this. Why? Just why? What were they thinking when they shipped this? The movie feels so rushed and incomplete that it's just an embarrassment to even call it an entry to the Avengers series. The only MCU movie to date I haven't seen is Captain Marvel which many claim is the worst, but my God... this cannot be much better if that's the case. I understand Covid likely had an effect on production and this and that and blah blah blah but still... how did the billion dollar prowess of Marvel and Disney say ""yup looks good let's print this"" without even questioning all of the things above? It's honesty laughable.On the plus side, Scarlett (like always) killed it. She basically carried the movie which otherwise was mediocre. Without her I swear I would hit 4/10 without even thinking about it but she really shined. You could tell she enjoyed making this and continuing to breathe life into the character.The CGI was good but not nearly dynamic enough for MCU glory. The action was good but definitely unsatisfying. So many opportunities missed. So many missteps that could have been easily avoided. Yelena, while fitting into combat well and mildly entertaining, had many half hearted attempts at humor that mostly fell flat. Strong start that just goes slowly downhill into smoldering disappointment.One more time I'll say it. You had one of the best villains in all in the comic universe and completely botched it. Taskmaster got the Black Mask treatment with unlimited potential but not nearly enough screen time.What a shame."
2212,8,"Don't understand the bad reviews This is not a send off movie. Black Widow was already dead. This is to give the audience a better understanding of her character and introduce a new one. It is a much needed origin story and I believe it is told well. It is a different style of Marvel film than we are use to, it plays more like a James Bond film especially in the beginning. I think this is a great installment in the series. I can't wait to see more of Yelena and salute Scarlet Johansson for giving me some many good movie going memories."
2213,6,"WE ASKED FOR THIS ""Black Widow"" shows how talented its actors are. That and the action scenes, however, aren't enough to make this a great movie. This movie is also a bit pointless, especially with where Romanoff's story went in Endgame."
2214,5,"Huh Short and simple, I could've wrote this. Do yourself a favor, watch it in 3D. The 3D visuals overshadow the plot. It looks like ScarJo mailed it in."
2215,5,"IN SHORT, A PIECE OF GARBAGE Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger.The movie has a somewhat good opening scene which will give you some expectations of being a good thrilling action superhero film. But, you will disappointed. The movie is littered with unnecessary jokes and melodrama. You may end up snoring during the second Act. When it comes to the third act - making, production and VFX quality is heavy and you may find it interesting to watch, but still it may fail to create a significant impact on you. The major reason behind that is due to the poor background score, BGM should have the capability to penetrate into the viewer's mind.The entire movie is soulless and hollow. Ineffective direction, cliche writing and a crappy background score is what fills the major chunk of the film.Not recommended!"
2216,7,"Don't believe the haters I'm seeing a lot of one star reviews, which is ridiculous. I'm assuming these are the same bitter incels who tried to bring Captain Marvel down. It's as if their fragile masculinity is threatened by a comic book movie that isn't full of shirtless muscle men. Maybe these reviewers have other issues they're working through. It'll be ok, little buddy.As far as the movie goes, is it Marvel's best movie? Absolutely not. Is it the worst? Not even close.The movie is cast perfectly, with Pugh and Harbour as standouts. The action sequences are great when they're on the ground. Some of the aerial stuff was very over-the-top CGI; however, scenes contained excellent fight choreo and great stunt work - reminiscent of the Bourne series. There were effective smatterings of humor and some heavier moments when Natasha and Yelena discussed their Red Room training.A lot of Marvel purists were disappointed by the re-working of Taskmaster, and while I do see this as the waste of an opportunity to introduce a more comic-faithful version of him in the MCU, I do feel that the villain was fairly effective within the plot of the movie.I think the ending and post-credits scene leave some interesting avenues for the MCU to explore, and I look forward to seeing where they lead."
2217,10,"Awesome Adventure! What an awesome movie to enjoy! Seen it with my friend!, Didn't think I was gonna be into it but I surprisingly was!!!!:)"
2218,2,"The final screenplay looks like it was somebody's unedited rough draft I am a huge Marvel fan, and it pains me to say that the great Taskmaster's first (and probably only) appearance is the first time I'm giving any of the MCU movies any rating less than 6/10.No effort at all was put into making this script or choreography believable, understandable, or even bearable. Marvel basically just needed to recreate existing good movies and it would have done well. The cinematography and fist fights were so obviously trying to mirror the Bourne movies, but the writers/choreographers didn't seem to realize that those movies did well because they had well thought out and intelligent action scenes. Black Widow had so many impossible physics moments it was embarrassing.The story was similar. There are tons of good spy movies, but this one never really explained the point of any major plot points, and the explanations they did give were either convoluted or they were told in such a disjointed manner that the point was unclear. Meanwhile it took a ridiculous amount of time to redundantly explain minor details. The supposedly well-trained spy sister was an idiot for risking 100% of the antidote in 1 move. After that move worked out, there should have been a huge conflict as the liberated minds took sides and/or tried to figure out what to do next. Surely the villain wasn't stupid enough to completely abandon the previous brainwashing techniques to rely solely on some experimental chemistry that allows people to create the antidote even while they are supposedly under complete control, right? Well he did try to protect himself from a team of elite snipers using a method that only works when his enemies are within a couple feet (a meter) of his body, so maybe he really is that dumb.But the movie's biggest problem by far was how they completely wasted Taskmaster. She could have *easily* been the main villain in a full Avengers movie with some *epic* buildup and suspense as she learns their moves and starts beating them at their own game. Instead they abandon all tension and degrade her down into yet another emotionless and motiveless karate master, as if the MCU doesn't have enough of those already. Because they trashed the character, it made the gender change (he's a male in the comics) seem like pandering moreso than actually promoting diversity. Also, the villain put a ton of emphasis on the fact that Taskmaster was controlled by a chip in her brain, not the same chemical treatment as the other assassins, so there's no reason why the antidote should have worked on her.The helicarrier crashing scene could have been cool, but instead they ruined all of the cool moments by adding absurdly unbelievable moments like Black Widow easily catching a hand rail with her bare hands after a full speed 50 ft drop. It would have been pretty epic if they had cut all the Taskmaster scenes and replaced them with an extended helicarrier escape scene in the same style as the newest Tomb Raider games/movie. Could have really solidified Black Widow as a badass human instead of the plot-armored tensionless popcorn action that they gave us.The best parts of the movie were Pugh's (Yelena) performance (even with the occasionally cringe-worthy dialogue she was given) and the Red Guardian, who was truly funny and could have been even funnier in the hands of a competent screenwriter."
2219,8,"Exciting, funny and action packed! Black Widow does not disappoint at all. It was a worthwhile wait. I do not understand why so much hate about it.From the beginning of the movie, I personally got directly hooked, the plot began to unfold in such an elegantly clear way and it always returned the emotion of tension, joy, fun or even drama.The action sequences are spectacular, the melee fights were very cool and in general the action of the movie is maintained from the beginning to the end.The best thing in the whole movie was to see Scarlet Johansson in all her splendor in her character as always making it wonderful. But Florence Pugh also complements this sister-sister chemistry in such a beautiful way and manages to make this adventure entertaining to the end.Also David Harbor and Rachel Weisz make good roles as interesting, funny and serious secondary characters but without much relevance in certain parts of the plot.The script is not the best or original that Marvel has presented, but it is still good for a movie with a female protagonist, even though I have already known this character long before.The villains are also not perfect and have previously seen objectives but therefore they did not make me the worst villains in the Marvel universe.As for the production, the film is very well done, some special effects I have heard that do not look completely perfect compared to other films but it did not make me ugly in itself.In conclusion, Black Widow fulfilled my expectations of what I expected in a solo movie of this wonderful character of the wonderful Scarlett Johansson and although it is not perfect, it does not make me the best Marvel Studios movie.The film managed to awaken my emotion towards what comes from these superhero movies in the future and leaves me with a good feeling of happiness for a future sequel to this film and wanting to see it again."
2220,2,"What a dud, marvel is going downhill fast They ruined my boo taskmaster and the movie was almost as bad as captain marvel. Maybe women shouldn't be in charge of making movies. Only gets 2 stars because I loved Florence Pugh so much."
2221,6,"Deserved more With 11 years or so to conceive a BW solo film, the character deserved a better effort. Pugh and Harbour are given much better material. The plot is just a retread of familiar MCU themes. That being said, it's not terrible, but no where near the level of the Cap films. My wife and daughter both liked it, who are not hardcore Marvel fans. Scarlett Johansson is a brilliant and talented actress, but honestly she sleepwalks through most of it. Taskmaster is so misused - she could have been a huge addition. It's a beautifully shot film, however; and the location work is fantastic."
2222,9,"I don't get all the hate...My fam and I loved it!!! I don't get why people are rating this movie so low. Yeah it was different from the usual marvel movies but that's one of the many reasons I liked it. It was action packed and taskmaster fight scenes were really cool! It had some family reunion/sibling scenes that didn't drag. I personally liked their interactions even the awkward moments. We don't really see Natasha with fam besides the avengers so it was nice to see she had people she can trust and care about and also care for her too. For all that happened between them, I think it was sweet and touching that they were in it together. It also had some funny moments from Yelena and their dad Alexeia. I have to say Yelena was definitely the star of the movie and I loved every moment she had screen time. I guess people who gave it lower rating were those who expected more of a superhero avenger like film but that's not what this really was."
2223,5,Zzzzz Zzzzzz Zzzzzzz Nice movie on the background when you fall a sleep.. I did.
2224,6,Ok. Ok movie. I wasn't as excited as the last episode of loki.
2225,5,"Am I done with Marvel? This movie has me wondering if it is me, and not the movie. The characters are ok, performances fine, and action sequences are competent.Yet it felt like a drag to watch all these unfold. Everything feels repetitive and derivative of other Marvel movies. And that's what makes me wonder if by now these superhero movies have been just too much of a good thing.All set pieces we have seen before, and there is not one element or character that does not have an almost exact counterpart in a previous Marvel movie. And maybe that is what we are supposed to get, right? The same thing we love, over and over again.Then maybe it is not you Marvel, it is me.It is me the one that feels that has to move on, because I don't think I can take any more of this kind of movie. It has been too much of the same. Good or bad no longer matters. I just think I need to see other movies."
2226,10,"Wasn't an origin story Loved that it was a story about black widow but not her origin story in many ways. More introducing her sister to the MCU while also giving a loved character more background. The mocking was nearly over the line but not enough to not like. I have a feeling we'll see more of the ""side"" characters coming to play a part in the future. Fun. Action packed."
2227,1,Horrible. Black Widow is a film that I've been seeing trailers played on my TV non stop. I decided to give it a watch tonight as my sister referred the film to me. The beginning and towards the middle of the film looked like it was going to be a awesome movie. I was let down and disappointed. This movie is absolutely horrible long and boring. I wouldn't waste time or money on rewatching this film at all. Everyone hated on Birds Of Prey!?? This film was the worst film of 2021.
2228,7,"Low expectations; high rewards I can't believe how much this movie exceeded my expectations. I thought it was going to be some tired retread of the ""assassin training school"" narrative. Instead, it told a fresh and surprising story that alludes to Natasha's backstory without literally making us go through it in chronological order. The ""family"" cast members were excellent and Scarjo really shines in some more intricately emotional moments than she had in the regular Avengers cycle. Well done, everyone involved. Another Marvel movie that's way better than it even needed to be."
2229,8,"Regardless of critics I will rewatch it no problems. I read a few hardcore comic fans review and I get it. Their not happy. That being said however I don't recall ever seeing diehard comic fans ever happy about any DC or Marvel movie. Casting issue's too many jokes, not enough action.bla bla bla.For me this movie was very good. I'm not a diehard comic fan but I am a fan of superhero movies. I loved learning about Natashia's history. I love the interaction with her sister and the choice for the sister is great as far as I am concerned.There are a few flaws here and there kind of like goofs but nothing worthy of ruining the film nor my enjoyment.I understand one person was upset by the anti hero's lack of lines and portrayal but isn't that what makes an anti hero mysterious and more villainous. They act like a pure evil killing machine. Thats the whole point. One day if this villain crosses over then they can give that person an entire backstory. There's no hurry.So anyhow if your a person who enjoys superhero movies and doesn't take them so serious that a bad joke can make you give up on life in general then your going to sit down and enjoy this film with whom ever your watching it with. I can guarantee it. Especially after this Covid 19 fun dry spell."
2230,5,"Very Disappointed Very weak story and bad action. I Expected much more better than end game, but this is what happening, the meh thing happens to BW, I love Natasha, but in this BW, I lost her power."
2231,6,"What I Expected This movie is nothing special. There were a few funny bits, and the over usage of action didn't bother me too much, but my main gripe with this movie is that it was just kinda boring. I felt hard to stay engaged at times. In my opinion this movie should have been what happened in Budapest, not this storyline. The only thing this storyline contributes is adding yelana, who was the best character of the movie. Besides that it wasn't really needed. Red guardian was the other stand out character. All the performances are good, but the main flaw of this movie is the plot. I hoped that this movie would add more depth to black widow, but it really didn't. Her best movies are still the winter soldier and endgame. Overall this movie was not bad, but not needed and could have been so much more."
2232,1,"The first Marvel movie to put me to sleep, and I've seen every one of them. After that boring movie, I can see why Scarlett Johansson has announced she is retiring from Any future black widow movies, obviously she watched and saw how bad it was and made a good decision to not continue ruining her career with a bad series."
2233,6,"Wrong master for the task The Taskmaster reveal was just too disappointing for me. It was like placing apples instead of pineapples on hawaiian pizza (though not everyone likes pineapples on their pizza). But seriously, if I were to choose who should have don the Taskmaster costume - it would be the long lost brother of Natasha Romanoff - I mean the story was all about family and the backstory of the Natasha - then why not make someone from her unknown past join into the MCU. In the comics Natasha had a brother named Vindiktor Romanov (it would definitely be an exciting story to know more about this storyline).The movie could have Vindiktor transformed into the Taskmaster by Dreykov as part of his revenge to Natasha for killing his daughter back in Budapest (with all of the brain washing experiments the red room has - this would be an interesting story to venture on). Yelena's story won't be sidelined to the story as she is the sister Natasha have grown to know with - thus making a sibling competition going into the story.The ending would even be interesting as Natasha finds out who the Taskmaster is (thanks to Dreykov), they fight in the end and Taskmaster dies at the hands of Natasha - or did he? - this will make a new story as a future villain for Yelena's Widow character or even better as a team partner in the future Thunderbolts team - the character of Taskmaster would have not gone into waste by poor storytelling for Dreykov's revenge. Natasha still dies in the Infinity War, Yelena becomes the new Black Widow, and Vindiktor (or maybe just rename him as Viktor) resurfaces with the Taskmaster character in the future MCU story.Yes the movie was good - but seems rushed and was not fully intended for Natasha's backstory but simply to introduce Yelena into the MCU. It could have been better with Nat's biological brother as the Taskmaster - but MCU missed this chance."
2234,7,"Watch, laugh, be entertained, move on to the next, forget! MCU has churned out so many movies, that any new entry is formulaic, to a greater or lesser extent. This falls within the latter. Like a lot of posts here, I agree it could have been better, but MCU/ Disney arent known for pushing the envelope, storyline wise. It was entertaining though. No complaints with the casting choice, except for Ray Winstone. He looked like a chunkier version Geoffrey Rush. I think Rush would've made the character much more interesting. Props to Florence Pugh and David Harbour for standing out. Harbour, IMO, stole every scene he was in! My recommendation is what the title suggests."
2235,3,"Over it I was looking forward to this movie, when I heard they were doing a back story on The Black Widow I was excited! Finally we get to see her ARC. Unfortunately the mark was missed. The story line was weak and predictable. I kind of had an idea what the movie was going to be by the trailers and sure enough it was. Rachel Weiss , while I love her, was wasted in this movie. David Harbour, is awesome, but his character was again predictable and while he did provide some comedic relief, it was in a way out of place. Newcomer Florence Pugh was good, but also a novice and well Scarlett Johansson was good but I've seen her do better.Disappointing, weak story...don't waste your money. Wait until it comes out on Disney+ for free."
2236,5,"Carried by the main cast It's a brutal spy film with a lot of people getting shot, blown up or stabbed, but the cutesy PG-13 rating makes a lot of the violence feel artificially 'clean' and neutered, cowardly. In fact, for the first half of the movie, 'artificial' was a good descriptor for a lot of aspects, such as the arbitrary justifications for some of the fights, the occasionally distracting, underbaked CGI or the somewhat disconnected soundtrack.That being said, Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbor are all on point; their characters have a delightful, engaging chemistry and there's both a surprising humor and a deep sorrow to their dynamic as a quasi-real family. It is here that lies the pleasant surprise of the movie, its greatest strength: giving Black Widow some more character development, deepening her profile as a character and leaving a post-Ultimatum legacy for her and the characters connected to her.I began watching this movie with a frustrated, cynical outlook, expecting a by-the-numbers cardboard flick of the Great Marvel Machinery, yet I found a heart in this story. It takes a while to show, and it is occasionally obfuscated, but it's definitely there."
2237,1,"BORING I have many word to describe this disaster (a silly low budget TV-Movie like), but I don't think it is worth my effort, I'm just sorry for the $30 i paid for it."
2238,4,"Should have stayed delayed After suffering multiple delays over the past year and change, it's fair to say the anticipation level for Natasha Romanoff's first (and likely last) solo film was much higher than it should have been. Unsurprisingly, the prequel did not live up to the hype.The problem with 'Black Widow' is it comes off as a standard, formulaic Marvel film that came off the assembly line just to check a box. It's true that Scarlett Johansson long ago earned the right to have her own entry in the MCU, but the franchise could have gone on just fine had this film never been created.David Harbour feels out of place as a washed up Soviet superhuman (not so much a superhero) and Rachel Weisz clearly did not show up for this gig to earn a shot at an Academy Award. The one bright spot is Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova, who manages to consistently nail a tricky Russian accent while effortlessly toggling between comedic one-liners and tough as nails action sequences.Save for a few impressive scenes, 'Widow' is pretty dull and doesn't feature any real fan favorites, especially compared to some of the better received Marvel entries of late. It's also clear that Disney had to scrounge around in the couch cushions to find enough pennies to pull this together - it just as well could have been turned into a miniseries on Disney+ given its quality.Lacking originality and coming so long after so many other films, 'Black Widow' is surely one of the lower tier installments in the MCU library. Still, it's worth a watch if for no other reason than to check a box."
2239,9,"Obsessed with black widow This movie was perfect for the mcu. The acting was fun, Florence was a great choice and the story was capturing. I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice. Will it win an Oscar, no. It does however fit so well into the mcu and I loved it."
2240,6,"So disappointed! Black widow is , hands down, one of the worst MCU movies. Actually there are a lot of negative points to talk about but I'll just include these which I see most important 1. Rachel Weisz character (Melina) was such a waste! They could certainly use her as a mother figure in a way that could add more drama to most of the scenes.2. Speaking of drama, the movie has a huge lack of that, It is one of a few MCU movies that I couldn't relate to its characters or even feel sad for them and their story.3. I never really felt like that I should be afraid that something bad is gonna happen to the team because, simply, even they didn't, I'm not from the people who complain about the comedic scenes that ruin marvel movies but that movie's comedic scenes REALLY ruined the movie.4. Last but certainly not the least, the villain in that movie is so bad, actually he's now the 1st one on my list of the worst MCU villains, I think that's the only MCU villain that we didn't even know his motives, he just wants to control the whole world all 90s bad guys style. Yeah and if you're excited to see Taskmaster in that movie because you like the character from the comics, then you'll really be disappointed, and I mean REALLY disappointed.But hey, the movie wasn't the worst of all time after all, what do you think that 6 is for?! So, let's move to the good points!1. Florence Pugh and David Harbour's comedic roles were pretty good, especially Pugh's, the girl literally stole the movie from everybody else even Scarlett.2 The CGI is, as usual, pretty good and the movie is a pleasant visual experience.3. The movie, as a whole, is entertaining to watch, I mean that's why movies are made, right?To make it short and sweet Black Widow is a meh movie with a solid plot, a little drama and nice comedic scenes. Yeah and I gotta say that it shouldn't even exist because simply it doesn't matter now because Nat actually (SPOILER ALERT FOR AVENGERS: ENDGAME) died, the only reason that movie exists is for its post-credit scene so, be sure to check that out."
2241,7,Worst movie ever. Im kidding. I liked it. Lots of fun action. Lots of funny moments. It even gave me the feels a few times. I thought it was funny when the suave handsome black guy was a swerve for TM.The editing i thought was excellent. Yelena is pretty gnarly. I hope she finds a pleasant way to die.
2242,7,"This movie should've come out years ago I was honestly really hoping that, ""Black Widow"" would be a good movie but I had so many issues with this movie. My biggest issue with this movie was the pacing of the movie. To me, there never really was a moment where the movie never really picked up for me and it just felt really slow. I know this movie wasn't meant to be fully action-packed but the family dynamic just didn't work for me at all. When the movie ended I legit just thought wow nothing really happened in this and was disappointed by it. On the topic of the family dynamic, I will say it definitely wasn't because of the acting since you can see all four of them really trying their best in this movie. Florence Pugh, who plays Yelena Belova, for me personally was the real stand out of the actors in this movie. Whenever you see the ""family"" on screen together you can easily see and tell how everybody feels about this. Marvel has not been known to have the best villains but in recent movies, we've been getting some better villains but, ""Black Widow"" just brought back the terrible villain. The villain in this movie is just so boring and lacks motivation. It also doesn't help that the audience never sees them. I feel like the biggest reason why this movie just didn't work for me is because of the story. The story didn't feel like it flowed very well from beginning to end and needed some tweaking. In the end, Black Widow just isn't a memorable movie and I will easily forget about it."
2243,6,"Not amazing, but better than I expected. I had a lot of fun seeing this in the theater, it's the first time I've been to the theater in a long time (besides A Quiet Place 2) and they were both the perfect movies to start going back to the theater with. It was neat seeing the marvel intro on the big screen again, and just being in the theater in general, so maybe this affected my experience a bit.I thought the movie was honestly pretty good. The action scenes were neat and I liked the characters, especially Yelena. Florence Pugh did an amazing job. While I would have liked a bit more of Red Guardian, I felt the characters worked together very well, and made the movie more enjoyable. I liked the villain a lot and how they didn't show him until the end of the movie. However, one very disappointing part was Taskmaster- they played her up in the trailer a lot, and then she ended up barely being in it.All in all, I had so much fun with the movie, and thought it had a pretty good story, and fun action scenes. I would definitely recommend seeing it."
2244,10,"Marvel is attempting to show that super heroes are human too I can see how this is not the typical marvel, action packed, no drama movie. I love Marvel, but I always felt most of their characters have terrific back stories that lend to actual story telling beyond the explosions and it is always brushed off. They go through horrible things and the ""say"" they are marked by them and it means everything but they don't act like something actually happened to them. The horrible trauma actually gets brushed off.They did a bit in TFAWS with Bucky having sort of a therapist, but that was even a joke.Here, maybe because it catered more to a female audience, I believe, they actually show that the Red Room was horrible and that it scared this women for life. Yes, it made them awesome, fearless killing machines but it also destroyed their childhood and their overall life and that is what moves the story forward.I read some reviews that say the villain is underwhelming, I think it is actually the best story of all of them because the villain is not this superhuman blowing stuff up; the villain is a normal human that preys on defenseless little girls just so he can gain power. It is the whole organization that destroyed Natasha's and Yelena's life. There is a personal stake in here.My only beef with the movie is that they never called Natasha, Natalia, which should have been her name back then."
2245,7,"Disappointed In A Good Movie Now when any marvel tv show movie or etc comes out my expectations are very high, So when Black Widow came out i was super excited to watch it in the Imax theater with family and friends, but as the Movie went on and on I became more disappointed. Now i did love the action and all the characters but that is also one of the problems, Yalena completely carried this movie with her humor and character development. Now the biggest disappointed of this movie Taskmaster now i could go on for days about how much TM was a disappointment but that would spoil the movie.Now in overall i give this movie a 7/10 and I recommend you check it out thank you for taking the time out your day to read my review."
2246,8,Lotta action Great timing to close the gap between Civil War and Infinity War. Also picks up in events on Falcon and TWS.
2247,2,"I went in the theater excited and left disappointed I was so, so excited to FINALLY see a Black Widow solo film after all these years of waiting, but unfortunately, after watching I was so disappointed after watching almost 2 hours of boring, flat storyline that had such a predictable plot, a wasted villain, and honestly, the film was an insult to Black Widow's legacy.Don't waste your time watching it. Very boring, predictable, sloppily done, and the only good parts about it were the couple of very short fighting scenes, Yelena, and the post credits scene, which was honestly better than the entire movie.Honestly if you just watched the post credits scene I think you'd be all set."
2248,8,"Stunned by all the bad reviews All I can say is that I must have been watching a different movie than all the bashers. It moved well, the dialogue between the main actors was timely and crispy, quite a few chuckle moments the smash and blow up scenes are starting to get a little stale but MCU and the 2 plus hours went by pretty quick. It does help if you like SJ, Pugh a very good actor, and I can see why they are planning to bring her into the MCU family. This one is head-and-shoulders better than F9."
2249,4,"It's not too bad but should have been a great one . Very disappointed , should have been a special one, as the last Black Widow movie ."
2250,10,"Perfect Send-off When we learned we were getting a Black Widow movie I didn't expect a family drama, but it was the perfect choice. Spy thrillers are a dime a dozen. Did we really need another? This was so much better.Scarlett Johansson always shines brightest in truly dramatic roles. Apparently, Natasha does too, because she's never shined brighter. From her dealings with her long-lost family to the way she handled her adversaries, we got to finally understand what makes Natasha tick and why she truly was the glue holding the Avengers together.The pacing was great. I enjoyed the hand-to-hand and even the CGI stuff, mandatory for a Marvel blockbuster, but the family moments made the movie. It's all heart.No one showed more heart than the star herself.. While many actors might have been tempted to use the executive producer title to insure themselves the spotlight, Scarlett opted to use hers to just make the best movie possible, even setting up a bright future for those who'd take her place. She surrounded herself with first-class talent and made sure everyone had a chance to shine.My only complaint is that this will be our last Black Widow movie with Natasha front and center, but I'm willing to wager all the infinity stones at the TVA that Black Widow 2 will have Scarlett Johansson's name listed among the executive producers.This was a perfect send-off for a beloved character."
2251,6,"Black Widow is a Solid Mid-Tier Marvel Flick with Good Supporting Cast Black Widow is long overdue: you could say that because the latest MCU release was delayed over a year, with the release date being shifted 4 times, or you could say that because out of the core founding Avengers in the MCU-version of Marvel, she's the only member to not have her own solo-movie yet. Just as a warning, I'm very spoiler-allergic, so my breakdown might include some spoilers and info that could reveal some key points.Overall, I thought Black Widow was a fun return to the movies, and the action sequences and snappy comedic dialogue makes it worth seeing in the theatre. After over a year stuck inside, it really made a difference to see Marvel on the big screen the way it's meant to be seen, with large sound, a huge picture, and a crowd that's on-board with the entire experience.I would rank Black Widow as a solid middle-of-the pack for MCU entries. It floats somewhere around Captain Marvel, the first Dr. Strange, and Iron Man 2: good, fun, plenty of action and some great one-liners and remarks that make callbacks to several established elements of the franchise, but also not what I'd consider to be in the top-tier of the saga at this point, either. Since Marvel has nailed it on so many of their releases, it's going to be harder and harder in the years to come for them to top their previous successes. I really hope that the new releases keep finding ways to push the limits, bend the genre, and add new elements us fans have been waiting to see.Pros: -the action sequences are for the most-part really well-shot and choreographed, with some great ideas featured in them -MCU newcomer Florence Pugh is outstanding as Yelena Belova, the alternate Black Widow in the comics, and in this version Natasha's sister. She handles the action and especially the humor really well, and provides the Eastern European accent that Scarlett Johansson's Widow never had -David Harbour is hilarious as the sister's adoptive father Red Guardian -The sisterly relationship between Natasha&Yelena is really well done, they both have great chemistry on-screen together and are the heart of the movieCons: -the action drops off in the middle section of the film, and while it sets up relationships and family ties, it starts to become a bit drawn-out and almost risks losing energy -we don't get enough of Natasha's origin&background, even in her own movie. The opening teases an awesome look at her childhood filled with tension and sets up a darker atmosphere, but then later on through the movie, it tries to shift the tone towards being more contemporary with huge action pieces and one liners (which as I mentioned, are still very funny) -Red Guardian, a character who's supposed to be the Russian equivalent to Captain America, is mainly there for comedic relief even though they set him up to be massively strong, and an asset to their mission. Harbour had me in stitches from his humor, but the script doesn't really justify much of a reason for him to be there story-wise -Taskmaster is under-utilized and is set-up to be a massive threat, but didn't pay off enough to my liking. I was hoping for a 3-way battle between Natasha, Yelena, and T. M. so that Yelena and Natasha could overwhelm T. M.'s battle-scanning abilities, but literally Hobbs&Shaw did this scene better, or, included it at all.It's great to see what happened to Widow's character after the events of the airfield battle in Captain America: Civil War. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the MCU filling in the gaps of the storyline that the movies don't cover, because there's so much they can still do in the past of the franchise that answers questions that linger, and connects dots that we've had to connect on our own so far.The only downside to releasing Black Widow after the character is (most-likely) perma-dead in the franchise is that when the tension rises in the movie, and you start to feel she's in danger, you immediately remember that she literally has to make it through all the events you're seeing, because she's there in Infinity War and Endgame.Another drawback I could've mentioned but didn't really bring up is that Ray Winstone as the villain is pretty generic and cut-and-dry, however that was a lot of movies in the MCU for about the first phase and a half: the focus has been more on the heroes for a long time, and this was definitely more about Natasha and Yelena's relationship, which they nailed. Winstone's Draykov is forgettable, but he's far from the only stock and standard MCU villain, so that's a criticism I'd raise towards the franchise as a whole (one which I think they've addressed: the MCU also has some great and memorable villains, too).The main tragedy is the way Taskmaster, a villain I've always thought had a cool angle, is used, or rather un-used, and then most likely cut out of future MCU movies and appearances, which is a shame. Making Taskmaster a victim of the main villain/circumstance, instead of a full-on villain, kind of took the teeth away from the character for me, and reminded me of the flat sort-of villain ""Ghost"" from Ant-Man and Wasp, who had a similar issue. You can write sympathetic villains, they can have understandable motivations, but I just feel making a villain someone's pawn or puppet and revealing them to be a victim isn't a story arc that's easy to do in a movie. That's something more cut-out for a TV show where you can really show the character changing over time with multiple appearances: my DBZ fans will recollect that Vegeta didn't do the heel-face turn overnight, that development takes time, or at least more than one movie.In general, if you miss the movies, love Marvel, and like Black Widow, and want to see a female-led superhero movie that's way better than Halley Berry's Catwoman, Elektra, or the 80's Supergirl movie (seriously, the major critics of female-led hero flicks need to remember how it used to be, when there's enough decent stuff out there starring hero ladies, then maybe we can raise the bar higher) and has some good laughs and decent action scenes, Black Widow is worth a watch, and of course, MCU fans have to stay for the post-credits that sets up for so much more story down the road.For being what you expect from the MCU, but not much more, I give Black Widow a 6.5 out of 10 (but IMDB doesn't let you do half-ratings) . Nostrovia."
2252,7,"Strong Solo Film for Natasha, Except for one Character... The story for Black Widow takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) is on the run after violating Sokovia Accords. When she flees to Norway, she encounters her sister, Yelena Belova. When they reunite, they have to escape other Black Widows who are trying to kill them as well as the Taskmaster who is after Natasha for carrying a substance called Red Dust. Natasha and Yelena are forced to face the past involving their parents as well as how they became to be the ""killers"" they are in the present day.This is the first Marvel movie that I have seen in theaters since Avengers Infinity War and it is also the first one that I saw on opening weekend. Not the best theater experience I ever had, but I do not think it affects my opinion of this film. I have always wondered why Black Widow never got her own film until today. She is such a cool character and she has the potential to have an interesting backstory and personality. She is also not as well known compared to the other Marvel characters. I only know Black Widow from the MCU. However, we finally have her solo film. How does Natasha fare in her solo story?Black Widow is ultimately a movie about Natasha's family. It is no normal family though. Natasha's family goes on an ""adventure"" that leads to her and her sister getting sent to Dreykov who puts them through training hell. Nat's story on how she became Black Widow is a lot more depressing and creepy than I thought it would be. It shows why she is one of the more serious and deadpan characters in the Avengers. It explores her inner demons well. The movie touches on the consequences of morally questionable actions. Nat has to confront her past and it is not pretty. She has to see her family again after not even looking for them for years. Worst of all, she has to deal with how she became Black Widow and what she did to the villain's daughter. This movie made me think about her as a person and not just a hero. It made her much more human and more of an anti-hero for better or worse.The tone of the film is pretty grim because of the themes it tackles, but there is plenty of comedy thanks to the family dynamic. One of my favorite scenes was Yelena making fun of Nat's ""heroic"" pose. That had me rolling. There is also some black comedy here to make sure the tone does not become too lighthearted. Overall, the story is good because it is a slow-burner that focuses on Nat's inner demons.Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance as Natasha to date. She is much more conflicted and emotive in the role, while still being the strong and stoic character she was in past Marvel films. She lets herself have a bit more humility with the character in both humorous and serious scenes. She even has a scene where she taunts the bad guy and it is great to watch. The movie along with Johansson's performance made me respect Natasha's character much more. You can tell she loves this character with all her heart. Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova is another standout. In fact, she is arguably the standout. She is so funny and charismatic in this role. Pugh is a natural and her character is incredibly charming while being really sympathetic. She is also the one to question Natasha's morality for good reasons. Pugh's chemistry with Johansson is spot on. They are so convincing that they act like sisters in real life. I would not be surprised if they are good friends in real life. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour play as their parents and they make for great characters as well. Harbour plays as such an over-the-top dad, that he feels like a parody of the bumbling dad archetype. Even in the climax, he is the only humorous part for better or worse.Then there are the villains. Both of them give me mixed thoughts. There is Dreykov who is easily one of the most despicable villains ever put in a Marvel film. The way he trains other women or even girls to become killing machines is creepy and disturbing and that is putting it lightly. He is also a smug coward who only gets into a fight when he is protected. He is only shown for a few minutes, but he has a big role and the actor playing as him makes the most out of his screen time to make him as loathsome as possible. Great job Ray Winstone! He is not the best villain, but he is fun to root against. The Taskmaster on the other hand is a horrible villain. I cannot say too much about them without spoiling the film, but the biggest problem (aside from comic book inaccuracies) is that the character feels like wasted potential. They could have been a great tragic villain, but they come off as too flat. The cast is great and most of the characters are good, but some of the villains could have been better.As for technical aspects, the biggest problem is the lighting, especially towards the beginning. There are some scenes with lighting that is too dim for the action scenes and in the opening scene as well. It gets better by the second act though. The costumes look solid, though Taskmaster's design looks generic. The action scenes are as good as you would expect from a Marvel film. My favorite sequence is the climactic battle where there is a free fall fight. It is a truly awesome sequence with great cinematography and slick fighting. The chase in Budapest is no slouch either. The scene where Natasha and Yelena break their father out of prison is great too. These three set pieces in particular are all beautifully-shot and fast-paced. These set pieces remind me why I like the action in MCU films so much. The first fight between Natasha and Taskmaster however is not so great. It is shot in the dark and it comes across as weak compared to the rest of the awesome action that comes later. Some of the cinematography is stunning, especially the scenes in the Red Room or in that whole ship. The musical score is one of the best in a Marvel film. It is pretty memorable and it adds to the tension in the film.Black Widow is a solid entry to the MCU. While it is far from the best Marvel film, it is a movie that fleshes out Natasha's flaws, provides solid action and brings an awesome family together. It also does a good job with its themes of family and morality. It makes you wonder how heroic Nat is, but the script succeeds in making her sympathetic. It was nice seeing a Marvel movie in theaters again and I hope that this new wave of Marvel films continue to deliver. This was a nice sendoff to a great MCU character.Stay through the credits! Trust me, it is a good one."
2253,8,Best movie of 2021 Loves it. More of a spy movie than a superhero movie. Family stuff. We enjoyed it! Hidden scene sets up #2.
2254,9,"Finally I don't understand the negative reviews for this movie.It's action packed, funny, heartfelt, and the end credits scene is very impactful (more so if you've watched Falcon and Winter Soldier, but that's all I'll say to keep this spoiler free).This movie plays out a bit like a spy film, but with the MCU's dash of over the top action. Not a bad thing, by any means, but it would've been cool to see this movie kinda take the trend of Ant-Man and be a different breed of MCU movie. It just felt like it kept bouncing between wanting to be a spy movie and an action heavy summer blockbuster. They still pulled it off, in my opinion. Also, while it was cool to see Taskmaster used in the MCU, that character felt very underutilized. Those are really my only two critiques.I've always loved Scar Jo as Black Widow, but Florence Pugh smashed this role out of the park and seeing her in the MCU makes my heart happy (she is forever my May Queen). David Harbour was also very good and sorta acts as the comic relief, alongside Florence. It was also very nice to see Rachel Weisz back in a major movie (I loved her in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, so seeing her in a badass role like this was almost nostalgic for me).All in all, this might be my favorite SOLO Marvel film since Thor Rangnarok (if that counts) or Black Panther (if Ragnarok doesn't count).Black Widow finally got her solo film and Marvel did her justice. Well worth the wait, though we shouldn't have had to wait this long."
2255,1,sucks Its just bad and has a weird pace. Personally im not a fan.
2256,6,6 is kinda generous I really wanted to like this flick. I love the character and the movies involving back story but this one just fell flat. I found myself just waiting for it to end so I was done with it. Add in the little teaser after the credits and I was just left thinking WTF?
2257,8,The trolls are out in full force Don't listen to them. It's an excellent action/super-hero movie. Just enjoy something for a change.
2258,5,"Ehh...that's it? I feel like this movie was hurt most by the timing and I don't mean the pandemic. This is a character who should have been explored sometime before, you know, she died...The problem is that all tension is undone by the fact that you know what happens next. The villains don't work because you know they aren't around for infinity war and our protagonists are. The whole family element is undone by the fact that they weren't given a single line of dialogue at any appearance in Natasha's life and death. I'm sorry, but a vest just doesn't do that.Other than that its standard marvel fair. Not bad, not good, just forgettable, like iron man 2. Performances are great, casting is great, but the actors are done a disservice by having nothing to do and no greater significance. None more so than Olga Kurylenko, who is in this movie for almost no reason and whose presence represents taking a steaming dump on who Taskmaster actually is.To be clear, the problem isn't her, it's what they've done to the character. Taskmaster is an interesting villain with unique abilities and he has been robbed of all that here and is nothing more than a Soviet Union knock off of Tony Starks combat adaptation program seen in civil war.The only purpose of this movie is Yelena and while I love Florence Pugh, it wasn't worth it."
2259,9,Don't listen to negative reviews. Really good movie with funny characters(red guardian and Yellina) with good action scenes and a mediocre villain.
2260,5,Bad Russian accents This movie had a pacing going and then it became extremely slow and the bad accents took me right out of it. They all lived in Ohio for years. They all speak perfect English. The fake Russian English is such bs.
2261,10,"Saturated, smart and funny! Loved this movie. It is honestly one of the best ones in Marvel series. String cast, saturated action with no parts that felt forced or boring. Good amount of background story, right balance of comedy and depth.Read a lot of reviews after and too many people are starting to think they are professional movies reviewers based on snobbish remarks.Go watch it, it's awesome and you will have fun."
2262,6,Good funny 9/10 marvel movie until the worst villain reveal in the mcu including mandarin Now I love taskmaster and it's not hard to bring taskmaster to the big screen but somehow they ruined her. My problem isn't that taskmasters a girl it's that they made her everything taskmaster isn't. I mean taskmaster is a mercenary who doesn't care what he/she is hired to do and just does it but this movie took that aspect of taskmaster and ruined it. All they had to do was make him/her a mercenary named Tony or Antonia Masters have photo graphic memory and be hired by the red room but they screwed it up. If this wasn't an already good movie then this would be like a 2/10. It was a horrible twist.
2263,8,"Strong, Powerful Women! Loved seeing women kick ass WITHOUT super-powers or needing men to save them! Usually, the woman trips & falls then tells the man ""Go on without me!"" I just HATE that! Storyline good, action was fast paced. I was pleased!"
2264,7,Good movie but it could be a lot better Action was awesome but story lacks behind. Blackwidow story is just ok could be a lot better.
2265,10,"Super Fun and Kicks Ass! A guaranteed good time and the movies! Check it out for yourselves before hopping on the 'insecure misogynists' bandwagon. Compelling action, humor, emotion, pacing, and performances. Great job, everyone!"
2266,1,"What the F This has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen, completely mixed up and goes no where, absolute rubbish."
2267,8,Mixed but worth the price The film would have been better if released right after Civil War but glad we did eventually got it. Florence Pugh is the superstar of this film. Scarlett is great but Yolena is as good a character as Tony Stark and Florence is as good as Robert Downey Jr. The climax is a little flat but the film has the best after credit scene of the MCU.
2268,8,"What a poser This comes after the Civil War and before the blink. We get a quick back story of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) quicker than what I had wished. Her entire training is done during the opening credits. I was hoping for more and her conversion etc. We get to meet her pseudo family of Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour who we already met as Alexi. Together they must save the world from Draykov (Ray Winstone) and his legion of Black Widows located world wide.It was not the film I wanted. Florence Pugh stole scenes from Scarlett Johansson, something I did not think possible. She points out the the Black Window always has that three point pose followed by a hair flip. This is what separates Marvel from DC: the dialogue is more entertaining."
2269,7,"Started off great.. A lot happens in the first 15 minutes, plenty of action and story telling, but it really tapers off on both as the movie slowly moves forward from there. The real star of the movie was Yelena, it was worth the watch just for Florence Pugh. Hang on after the credits roll, as always there's a small cameo, it has me looking forward to another branch off."
2270,7,"It's a decent action film and an enjoyable watch if treated as such Low to mid 7/10 overall: starts off a 8/10 quickly devolves into a very low 6/10.The movie had a very strong start, starting with a narratively compelling opening sequence and quickly developing into a series of well-choreographed action set pieces.From there, and about halfway into the movie, It feels like as more moving pieces started coming into play the script didn't really know what to do with itself and failed to properly juggle or balance all the different elements. The pace slowed as layers of backstory were dialogued and the attempt to layer in the broken-family healing motif fell pretty flat.What's more is that as the plot got more complicated, so too did the action. Nearing the 3rd act of the film, all the action involved Michael Bay levels of explosions, car crashes that even Captain America would struggle to survive, and Avenger's level threats that felt out of scope for a Black Widow movie. The CGI was just as bad there, especially in the climactic final scenes. There's also a couple of weird ""solutions"" that are casually glossed over (you can sever a nerve by banging your head on a desk? What?) In all, the action sequences in act 2 and 3 were too high stakes and over-the-top to feel in place for the movie and break the immersive feeling that the crew worked hard to put in place during the first act.Also wasn't blown away by the use of Taskmaster in this movie, felt like a weak origin story with a pretty mediocre ending. Cool fight sequences though, good inclusion of iconic fight choreo from Black Panther, Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Cpt America, etc.Lastly, this movie continues the tradition of sacrificial set pieces with table stakes where the ending has to be happy. Yelena destroys a rotor and gets flung off in an explosion that would literally kill any non-super. Just have her jump off before it explodes, make the explosion smaller, or have that be a traditional sacrifice for her and her sisters' pain. How does an action director not get this?"
2271,10,Black Widow is a Must Black Widow is a lot of fun and it is definitely a must see movie. The acting was on point and the action was out of this world. Pugh was also the main attraction besides her being fantastic she is absolutely sexy!!!! First Pugh is HOT!!!!!! Second this is just an absolutely awesome movie that needs to be seen. It got better and better throughout the film. This is by far my favorite marvel film. It is just so so good.
2272,5,"Marvel Goes Woke with Confusing Feminist Actioner From the rather absurd start to the Bcak Widow, to about 20 mins into the film, you don't really know what the hell its all about.From then on its one impossible action scene after another with a largely female kick ass cast."
2273,1,Who cares Never cared for black widow during all the other marvel movies. She doesn't have super powers and was just a filler character. The movie was nothing special and can't believe a character actually uses smell as a defense against black widow. Like couldn't she just back up a little or something..
2274,8,"Great except for the villain. Black Widow has a really good cast, good story, and fantastic special effects and action. The films looks gorgeous and is pretty great overall. However, Taskmaster's portrayal here is terrible. After seeing the scene where Natasha blows up the building with the daughter inside, it is blatantly obvious she is Taskmaster. This would be somewhat redeemed was she actually developed, but she is not in the slightest. I don't know why they had to make her related to Natasha. All they had to do was not make it obvious and develop the character even slightly and even than they failed to do that. This movie was really good, especially with the acting and action, but my lord Taskmaster's portrayal here was abhorrent."
2275,8,Better then Ms. marvel The movie was very good better then the other women in marvel movis ... talking about ms. Marvel. It show u y black widow is the way she is.
2276,10,"Best Avenger Movie. To me this was the best avenger movie out of all them. So Entertaining! Action, story, fight scenes, humor - just amazing.I really enjoyed 2 hours and for a long time I was completely in the movie, not bored for any moment, wanting to skip a few frames. 10/10 for me."
2277,10,"Great Great movie, i really enjoy the show. Its all about family love. Good job marvel."
2278,7,"Either a 6.5 or a 7/10 Black Widow was unfortunately a bit disappointing, but I still had fun watching it. Scarlett Johansson is of course great as Black Widow, but Florence Pugh's portrayal of Yelena is outstanding! I also loved the bond between Yelena and Natasha (Scarlett) as they are sarcastic yet charismatic together. Alongside with the chemistry between Rachel Weisz and David Harbour (who is hilarious in the film). But my big issue with Black Widow is that it mostly feels like what you expect from a Marvel movie. With some of the over-the-top action scenes with fights, explosions, and epic orchestral's. Including teaming up with people at a secret base and having them help the protagonist in the climax. There also is humor as you would expect from a Marvel movie, I laughed at some of the jokes and implied humor but it felt a little too constant. Overall I wouldn't say Black Widow is one of the best superhero movies (unfortunately), but I still would recommend it to Marvel fans!"
2279,9,"One of the better Marvel Solos No quite the film Black Widow deserved but very close.Brilliant cast, especially all of the ""Family"", plenty of humour and decent action.Not as fun as Ragnarok, less action than Winter Soldier but way better than all 3 iron mans, both early thors and the overated black panther.It did a good job of filling in the blanks for Widow's origin and told an interesting story about what makes her tick.It made total sense to me that the she didnt have a big fight with taskmaster at the end, the plot made it pretty obvious why she didnt want that.It would have been a 10 but it looses 1 for an out of place Ray Winstone and for giving me a slither of hope to be crushed all over again seconds later when the final whistle in the end credits scene wasnt returned.Bye Nat gonna miss you.Hi Yelena you seem cool."
2280,5,"This should've been a Disney series This should've been a Disney series.I mean come on! I was halfway through the movie and felt like I was watching one of those filler episodes from a series. Not a worthy story, nor relevant for a full on movie. By the end I was wondering when would the movie step it up. Guess it never really did.BAD VFX!They either decided to lower the budget on this one, because the main character doesn't really have powers or abilities that requires much VFXs or they simply thought it wasn't worth the budget. Either way, they could've gone with physical effects on many situations like their Disney series.1 hour too long; unfunny, really boring, dry, some times cringe worthy writing.I can't say I wasn't disappointed, but also I wasn't expecting much either.WandaVision had a better story.If I could describe this movie in 3 words: filler, tedious and Irrelevant."
2281,9,I don't understand all the disappointment Stand alone the movie was entertaining. For all the whiners out there saying it's to little to late shut it the movie was fun to watch and the cast had chemistry.
2282,5,"Florence Pugh gets the 5 stars Movie should have been placed linearly where it was relatable, for starters.Florence Pugh was a revelation, never seen her before. Didnt expect Scarlett Johannson would ever be updated, but she was, and totally.....Not overly into super hero movies, but always liked the black widow character, and what Ms Johannson brought to it, but this should have been called Black Widows Little Sister (Is Totally Owning)"
2283,10,Not bad Pretty good. Movie was was pretty good despite some flaws. Loved every minute.
2284,5,"It felt like I was watching a DC movie It didn't deliver. Neither good or bad, more meh.The story and pacing was long, boring, and didn't hit the key emotional points it could have had.They had a real opportunity to deliver a family for Black Widow, but instead of having a few moments of clarity, they instead told lame jokes that didn't sit right.Jeremy Jahns got it right when he said task master is the worse villian they've ever done in the MCU. Instead of gender swapping characters, they could come up with 'new ones', why not? They had the opportunity to give the 'villian' an actual back story, but didn't focus on it.It just didn't deliver, I still don't understand how Rotten Tomatoes locks audience reviews saying this is 92%, when it's clearly not.The directors vision was muddied, long, boring, the set pieces were predictable.......what made previous marvel movies so good is seeing something I haven't seen before......this didn't do it.Scarlett Johansson saying this is a 'me to' movement, when it's not.......lets be honest, 90% of guys are. Good guys. Coming out and and instantly saying you're underpaid (She got 25 million for this movie), when other male actors don't get that is ridiculous.We're living in this world now where instead of focusing on great stories and good characters, it's all about politics and ideology. Insulting half of your fan base before the movie starts off isn't going to sit well as that isn't inclusive at all.It didn't hit a home run, or come close to what we've seen before. Putting the best people in charge 'male' or 'female', would serve them more in the future, instead of identity politics.....we're all better off working together."
2285,6,"A lot of good that contains some bumps throughout I think Kevin Feige is an amazing producer, but I always felt it was so dumb that it took so long for Black Widow to have her film. What is more jarring that this came out after Endgame which concluded her story. Nevertheless, it is here and I was still kind of hype for it despite it all. The premise is ""Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger"". So is this another MCU hit or a miss?Firstly, the supporting cast is all stellar. David Harbour as Red Guardian was hilarious and he was incredibly charming even if his character was kind of an ass. Rachel Weisz was also great as Melina, the fake mother of Natasha, as she gives a performance that conveys the conflict her character is going through yet also being quite lovable. Florence Pugh as Yelena, Natasha's sister, is the true stand out in this film. Her performance is so charismatic and charming while also being a proper badass. Her character has the most vulnerability compared to everyone else and Florence's shows this by really delivering on the emotional performance. She also has great chemistry with Scarlett Johansson so the interaction between Yelena and Natasha are some of the biggest highlights of Black Widow. Scarlett is also still phenomenal as Natasha and she still delivers here as well. We get to see more emotion from her character which allows Scarlett to do a lot more and shine in these scenes.The music score is composed by legendary composer Lorne Balfe and he continues to make another amazing score for Black Widow. Every action scene feels more hype whenever his score is being blasted and it's just awesome. The emotional scenes become more emotional and the tense scenes become more tense thanks to his score. I also really love the action scenes, for the most part. The hand-to-hand fights felt gritty and brutal which made it very entertaining to watch. There is also a pretty cool car chase and a fight where Black Widow has to fight countless other Red Room assassins which were very enjoyable as well.However, the story is quite a mixed bag for me thanks to how it is executed. The movie does a lot of telling of her past rather than showing which is kind of disappointing. I think seeing the red ledger stuff she did as a Red Room assassin would've given the ending more impact. Additionally, Black Widow explores the theme of family but handles it quite poorly. Natasha confronting her fake family is emotional stuff and the movie does show it but it would then deflect it with a silly joke which did get annoying. This is terrible when it came to the dad, Red Guardian. The movie treats him like a joke even though he did an incredibly terrible thing that caused his fake daughters to dislike him. There is a moment where he does start trying to repair his relationship with his daughters which was very sweet but the story doesn't stay long enough on this. He also doesn't get a moment to show how much he cares for his daughter which disappointed me. I did have my issue with how jokes are used in MCU movies but I think it is more annoying here than it is in previous MCU movies. The story is also very low stakes and because of Endgame, there doesn't feel like there is much danger to our main characters.The action scenes near the end are quite disappointing as well. There is a fight between the Red Guardian and Taskmaster which sounds on paper cool as both have some kind of superpower. However, the editing had lots of cuts with also constantly cutting away to something else which made it jarring. Additionally, Red Guardian, despite having super strength, never gets to show this in the fight. There is also a final fight between Black Widow and Taskmaster at the end which is mostly a CGI fest but is also incredibly short as well. It was a disappointing final fight for sure. On that note, the villains in Black Widow are also very disappointing. Dreykov, the leader of the Red Room, doesn't even have much of a presence on the plot until 40 minutes in. Even when they start appearing, they still have no presence as the plot is more focused on getting the family together than villains doing something. Taskmaster may be the most disappointing villain in MCU history. They are such a deviation from the comic as Taskmaster never speaks ever. There is also a reveal about Taskmaster that is just lame.Overall, Black Widow is a movie I feel so incredibly conflicted about. The story and villains are quite poor but there are moments in it that are very good. The characters and performances by actors are all great but some characters don't get enough to shine. The action scenes are entertaining but it does stumble near the end. Black Widow is a movie with a lot of good that contains some bumps throughout. In the end, I am glad it finally came out and I enjoyed watching it even though it does feel a bit too late."
2286,7,"I don't know what movie many of these reviewers watched. I am a 60 year old man that enjoys being entertained and ""Black Widow"" accomplished that. Sure there are some plot holes and some ""wokeness"" but some story holes are filled and in typical MCU fashion, there are threads that lead ""elsewhere"". Florence Pugh was a great presence and I look forward to her next appearance in the MCU. One tiny little spoiler, It appears that David Harbour escapes from a russian prison twice. I've had a crush on Rachel Weisz since ""the Mummy"". For cryin' out loud, grab your popcorn and let yourself be entertained."
2287,10,"Great effort put in the movie... OUTSTANDING I loved the movie... I know that we believe less was shown for greater characters like the Taskmaster and the Red Guardian... But that's not their fault... We people have been craving for more content after all these series have released... It feels like even they should've gotten the chance to present more of their talents...Florence, Scarlett, Rachel, David, excellent performance. I'm glad this film has finally released. WORTH THE WAIT!LET'S SEE WHAT THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE UNFOLDS IN THE FUTURE... ALL THE BEST TO THE WHOLE TEAM AND GOD BLESS YOU...."
2288,9,"Checks all the boxes This movie checks all the boxes you'd expect to see in a Marvel movie - humor, a lot of action, interesting characters, and a jaw-dropping post-credits scene. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz did a great job, as did Florence Pugh. Some of the action scenes were a little over-the-top, but it's a superhero movie so I didn't expect anything less."
2289,9,"""Do we know if she had family?"" Where to begin? I love Black Widow as ever than before. Her character was alright, but at least we got her character redeemed. I love the sisterhood between her and Yelena, even the family traits. Glad to see one of my favorite actors from Stranger Things. He did a fantastic job at performing. Look, I know nothing about Taskmaster from the comics. I'm fine with what they have done to her. Sometimes, we can't get full comic portrayals. Every Marvel movie can't promise that. Decent origin story between the sisters. I find the Widow Program somewhat unsettling. I see what the writers wanted to do with the movie not being a normal MCU movie. I think they wanted to redeem Black Widow's character with honor, thus answering Tony's question if she even had a family. I think I was too harsh on complaining that the film should have been released sometime after Captain America: Civil War. I do wish they had more menace to the main villain. Of course, the actor had an astounding performance after all. Great action, cinematography,Speaking about the film, I want to discuss the post-credit scene. What a god damn shocker. I am looking forwards to the Hawkeye TV Show. Chills. Overall, this film might not be for others whose expectations were really high. I thought this film was gonna suck, but it didn't in my opinion.EDIT: I wanted to add more, so why not? I think my most favorite scene from Black Widow would be the powerful opening montage. It was heavily emotional and dark. Natasha had a F-up childhood. I wouldn't be surprised if Marvel is heading for a maturer tone. I can't forget that scene when Yelena did the iconic Black Widow pose, LOL. ""Ugh, that was disgusting."" even when Natasha broke her nose, then fixed it. I felt that. I think that reproduction thing has beyond traumatized me...9/10."
2290,10,Boom boom bang hit in the box officie This long awated movie finally came and it was amazing.
2291,10,"I don't understand why this movie hasn't gotten enough praise. This standalone movie about Black Widow is not like Thor or Iron Man because Black widow is not as strong as them. This movie is great for what it is giving us a great look into the backstory of the character, funny and humorous characters, great family moments and overall really fun and exhilarating action. It's got a great concept and plot that gives the movie a reason to watch it. Overall a really solid film from marvel."
2292,6,"It is a sputter into a dud I love Black Widow. I was upset that they decided to do Thor 2 before Black Widow, then I wondered why do Ant-man 1 and 2 before BW, then Captain Marvel...Then I realized they were going to waste the first female avenger with a prequel...and I knew it would not be an Endgame but I was at least hoping for a decent stand alone movie...but it fails. The characters are boring with minimal chemistry, the main villain isn't it much, it is a generic plot and it is hard to care about because BW was killed off never to return. The only thing it did watch give us a ""New Black Widow"" that while carrying the mantle of a KGB femme fatal doesn't have the poise or grace of her predecessor."
2293,1,Mindless nonsense. Don't try to pay attention to the plot because there isn't one. Hollywood garbage.
2294,7,"Thats the Marvel's Jason Bourne Intense! My first movie on theaters at the post-pandemic. Enjoyed it... super fun, good action and excellent casting!"
2295,5,"Bland cgi action girl powa It's pity to realize this is more lame than The Falcon and the Winter soldier, and they are at least (i think) way cheaper to make.How does someone escape from government in an old cessna? And how does someone ""disappear from the radar"" by having floating fortress in the sky? Never heard of satellite surveillance, in a marvel universe that share space with ironman's stark industries, iron fist's Rand Enterprises, various government, including wakanda, shield, and sword? And how would it hover? By these lame propellers that supermom finishes with one hit from a gun? How would they bring fuel for this (undetected?) Wouldn't be more ""stealth"" way be hidden in an ocean or something? Apart from the premise, lame plot devices/gubers that are not explained, giving hundreds of millions of dollars to clearly incompetent no name director just because she is a wahmen? Also giving screenwriting to other wahmen of similar ""experience"" that don't bother not with reading comics, but perhaps even former movies that featured main antagonist, for nothing more than bland action flick like charlies angels... only male characters are 3: incopetent fake father (despite being actual supersoldier he's just a joke relief), sleepy arms dealer, and generic bad ruskie villain. This is new low for marvel, and it's sad, since Black Widow used to be interesting character. Whole marvel phase is wearing off. Maybe, some tv show keeps them afloat, but movies like this... don't think so."
2296,4,"Solid start, same old marvel ending 1st hour was really decent, i was well into it, then all of a sudden Dissapointing, same old generic marvel film, started great but massively peterd out, taskmaster was a baddass, then i find out they genderswapped him for a her, If men innit aint bad guys then theym stupid, wahmen m-she-u is the future for this brand, i feel sorry for scarlett johansenn cus her characters been great over the years, same old typical marvel generic film off the bandwaggon. It started as a solid 7/10 but dropped massively to a 4/10 at best for me."
2297,5,"Black Widow - the editing mess I'm really divide how to rate this movie.For one part, it only serves to introduce Yelena to MCU and provide a movie to the Black Widow that should had being made 5 years ago after Civil War. All the main actors are pretty good with Florence Pugh and David Harbour stealing the majority of the scenes.And the first act are pretty interesting.In terms of Black Widow character, this movie could being made only with Yelena and works, only doing some small changes.The end in Red room is rush and unsatisfactory, and Taskmaster is one more villain waste by MCU.But the biggest problem is editing of this movie. 99% of every scene jump cut every 3 seconds, not only in action parts but in slow scenes for no reason.MCU movies uses a lot jump cuts to try making the scenes more ""fast and have more impact"" and this needs to stop. Black Widow deserved a better movie long time ago."
2298,8,"An incredible action super-hero movie This is the story of a black widow name Natasha (a special type of fighter) who finds out other widows are under the control of a very bad man. This man controls them by using a chip. One of the widows who is Natasha's sister finds out this by chance during a mission in Morocco and the story begins. This is a very nice Marvel story.The movie has a great acting crew. Scarlett Johansson, David Harbour, Rachel Welsz, and Florence Pugh are awesome in this movie. Even though I saw a very nice act from Scarlett Johansson, she can play much better if her role allows her. For example, you can watch her movie with Bill Murray 'Lost in Translation 2003'. You will see how much capable she is.The special effect is incredible in the movie, especially in the sky fight scene. The action scenes are wonderful. My favorite scene is the car chasing scene. You see a lot of incredible stunt moves. There are a wide variety of scenes in the movie. I recommend this movie to superhero and action movie fans."
2299,3,"Trash master Started okay, after that an onslaught of bad acting, terrible jokes and terrible storyline was spewed out with a terrible pace. Had some great actors in it to but goes to show you really need a good director who isn't influenced 100 percent by the studio."
2300,4,Leaves you feeling DIRTY Totally left with an elderly male sexual predator vibe. So gross. No depth to villain other than being gross. Bad CGI fight transitions on actors. Underwhelming for Marvel; pretty disappointed. Was really looking forward to this after the winter soldier/falcon series let down.
2301,8,"Wow... This is a very different feel for a marvel movie... however it really works. The humour is balanced easily with the action sequences and it feels so nice to be seeing marvel again. This film has 3 acts, act 1 and 3 are action filled and act 2 is filled with talking... but honestly. Seen it three times. Amazing. Plus that post credit scene was exceptional and exciting."
2302,4,"Did I just watch a marvel or fast and furious movie? I've loved all the marvel movies so far, but this was just over the top and unrealistic.Some parts were ok, but the car chases, avalanche, blowing up sky stations and constant talk about family had me feeling like I was watching a fast and furious movie. Plus the attempt at comedy and Russian accents were pretty bad.And the fighting scene in the sky? Really?Romanoff was fighting like she had some sort of new found super strength which was kind of hard to watch.I guess after 10 years of character development I was expecting a more realistic action movie with less lame bits.I dunno, maybe I'll enjoy it second time around."
2303,10,Movie was lit Expected way too much for this movie and I got it thrown right in my face proving me wrong Won't hesitate to watch it again.
2304,8,"Perfect hole-filler for marvel fans. In my opinion, the film started hard and fast which really drew you in. I understand people saying it slowed up but it tied up a lot of loose ends for the bigger picture MCU. The climax and ending proved satisfactory. Everything you could want in a marvel film."
2305,4,"Complete Fail It's not even a Black Widow movie. It's a two hour long infomercial for the soon to be Hawkeye Disney+ series (ohh, ooh, stay for the post credit scene. Blech.)The other pudgy Russian girl who we neither know nor care about gets the focus as, of course she's set to be a recurring character on the aforementioned streamer. The other supporting characters are forgettable. Taskmaster isn't even worth mentioning, looking like the illegitimate child of Captain America and one of the Aliens from John Carpenters 'They Live' but without the character development. The action choreography and CGI were dodgy and poorly constructed. The forced humor was cringe, as was the use of 'Smells like Teen Spirit' in a Marvel movie for what feels like the 100th time (can we at least use another Nirvana song please?)Black Widow is right up there with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2 as the worst MCU movie. Probably the worse."
2306,6,This character deserved a better movie! I went into Black Widow with petty high expectations. Due to the fact that we've had to wait for it fir over a year because of Covid it made expecations even higher. Not all of the films in the MCU are masterpieces but most of them are entertaining and somewhat memorable. Black Widow for me has been one of the best characters in the Marvel Universe and I don't understand why she never got her own stand alone film until after we know her fate in Avengers: Endgame. But we finally get this film and unfortunately it is one of the weakest MCU films since it started in 2008 with Iron Man.Scarlett Johanssen is credited as an executive producer on the film so I think she had some say in the direction the film but she should have gotten a better script. The film is set in after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Natasha Romanoff is on tge run because The Avengers are all being hunted. We get some backstort with Natasha as a kid with her sister Yekelana and her supposed parents Melina and Alexei. The movie is not really an origin story but it deals with some of the things that formed Natasha into the woman she is. The film feels very jokey and lazy at the same time. There is a good chemistry between Scarlet Johanssen and Florence Pugh who plays Yelena. Pugh gives the best performance in the film. She is very funny and fleshes out her character well. Rachel Weisz Is and David Harbour are good in their roles but are really just comic relief. The action is not particularly exciting. Nothing we've never seen before. The main villain Dreykov is also very weak. As fantastical as these types of films are they work when they involve us is what's happening. We get invested in the story. It did not feel invested. The action is over the top as expected but is really just average. There is no sense of danger. The CGI dominates so much that it just isn't exciting. It's disappointing that such a great Marvel character would get such an average and uninspired film.One of the worst in the series.Grade: C-
2307,5,"Just managed to sit through this Could have been much, much better - disappointed. Awful casting, Poor acting and the humour just doesn't land. Found it hard to warm to any of the characters. I give it 5 as I did at least manage to watch til the end - just."
2308,5,Okay and that's about it For trained assassins they sure love to have tears in their eyes. Since everyone in the world already knows she dies in avengers this would've been a great chance to introduce some of the Russian marvel characters but I guess they thought why bother. A complete waste of taskmaster and destroyed the original mercenary backstory. Marvel's getting good at doing that.
2309,6,"Not a bad prequel if you can avoid thinking about Avengers Endgame Black Widow is the latest Disney + Premiere Access/Marvel outing starring Scarlett Johanson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz,David Harbour and Ray Winstone. Set before Avengers Endgame and Civil War this film takes place in 1996 where we see a young Natasha Romanoff and her sister(later played by Florence Pugh) who are reared by Russian spies (Rachel Weisz and David Harbour sporting Russian accents) who are on the run from Shield.21 years later and Natasha (Scarlett Johanson) is all grown up and reunites with the spies who reared her and her sister (I presume its her sister) to find out about these chips that are implanted onto spies. What is the chip used for and who is the masked figure and bad guy behind it all.It's no Wonder Woman or anything spectacular but I did enjoy it. Viewers should not take too much heed on why Natasha is still alive, when she clearly died in Avengers Endgame,but there is a post credit scene to watch at the end of the film.Florence Pugh was definitely the show stopper here and the action sequences were good. My advice don't spend 29.99 to see it or 21.99 to see it either see it in the cinemas or wait till its available in October on Disney +.C."
2310,9,Awesome!!!!!! Fun freakin film. It seriously had me hootin' and hollerin'. Good flick.
2311,5,"Really basic action movie Really wanted to like the movie, because black widow is suck an awesome character, but it just fall way to short. Scarlett Johansson's acting is good, but in all honesty you just know this movie is here to set up the next Marvel movies to come and for Scarlett to say goodbye to the character. The story Line was okay, but very generic and done some many times before. The movie feel emotionless and no high stakes."
2312,10,Amazing This movie have everything Sadness comedy non stop action suspense worth to wait I didn't get disappointed just go WATCH right now.
2313,4,"One of the most boring marvel movies Almost as boring as the first captain America movie. One of the worst in all marvel history, sadly."
2314,6,"Not Great not Terrible There was so much hype about the concept of this film that I guess people built an image of a perfect Marvel Natasha film, for a good reason as the character was with us for like a decade... The creators of the film decided to do this one Winter Soldier/Nikita style, where it would feel like you are watching a Bond style film... The concept of a rogue agent bringing down an organization is pretty old so the film doesn't feel extremely fresh, while there are some decent action scenes , there is an abundance of content that would betted be left out for the film's sake... Overall this is not as terrible as Thor The Dark world, so you can watch this once, like X-Men Origins: Wolverine and forget what it was about..."
2315,2,B-O-R-I-N-G Something should have told me with all the delays it was going to be a bad movie. Clearly the worst installment in the MCU. To think I waited all this time for this.
2316,7,"Not bad, but i expected better. Very entertaining movie, with a lot of action scenes, but i wish it had more storyline. I went into watching this movie excepting black widows origin story, and though it does show some of it i wish we would've followed her growing up instead. The whole thing feels kinda thrown together, but with that said I still think this is a movie definitely worth watching.I LOVED Pugh and Harbour characters, and thought they added a nice humor to the movie."
2317,5,"Was bang average This film was ok in a way that it had a decent entry in the story behind the character. However the movie was not as good as I had originally anticipated. It's basically a bath of CGI and fancy stunts, but there is very little plot and the villain of the movie is rarely in it.I get the impression Marvel didn't really want to make this movie and saw it as a throw away movie. It sure seems like it."
2318,4,Nothing special Really not nice movie.
2319,9,"Escapist Fun with a few tender moments Black Widow wasn't the best of the Marvel movies, and didn't have as much depth as I would have liked to have seen since we've been waiting so long for Natasha to get her due, but overall it's a fun outing with some terrific acting and all the quips that we've come to expect from the MCU. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh have wonderful chemistry, and David Harbour and Rachel Weisz are delightful as the parents who fill out the fun faux family. They may have been separated for 21 years but they still emotionally manage to find their way ""home"" to each other again. This was far from high art, but a decent way to spend an afternoon if you're looking for some girl power action adventure that fills in a few gaps in the every expanding Marvel universe."
2320,6,"Pugh and Harbour great in generic action film I for one have never wondered about Natasha Romanoff's past, nor have I heard anyone else ask about it. What is there to tell about the physically enchanced super spy/soldier/assassin which hasn't already been told in dousens of films already? Not much, as it turns out. Changing faces to trick an enemy? Ethan Hund (Mission Impossible) has done that in some thirty movies for the last to decades. As for tracking the mastermind behind a network of mind controlled assasins, it's already been done by Jason Bourne in at least five movies.Don't get me wrong, Black Widow is still an enjoyable movie. The action is pretty good and the camerawork decent. The addition of Florence Pugh as Natasha's sister adds some real emotion to the mix, and David Harbour as Natasha's father adds some pretty awesome comic relief.As for being part of the MCU, Black Widow isn't much more than a filler episode."
2321,7,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I had seen the reviews before watching so I came with lower expectations and I had a really good time. In my opinion the flaws lie within the first 10-15 minutes of the movie it's a little bit rough but after that it has great comedic timing, beautiful cinematography, and excellent performances (especially from Florence Pugh and David harbour) all in all a solid marvel film."
2322,8,"One of the best marvel movies I absolutely loved this movie. New faces in the marvel universe, and the credit scene????!! I'm so excited for the next marvel movie. The movie contained a plottwist and had a strong storyline. It's a little bit different then the other marvel movies in a good way!"
2323,8,"Was surprised how much I liked this movie The title giving Black Widow is not the center of this movie while the rest of the cast is orbiting around her. Instead this is an excellent ensemble cast. A lot of the story is carried by strong actresses - Johansson, Weisz, Pugh supported by Harbour. The pace, the plot, character motives - everything played out nicely."
2324,10,"Why so many bad reviews? I loved it! Really don't understand the bad reviews, I enjoyed this film very much. Epic action and emotional scenes that made me cry. For me an amazing film I loved from the first to the last moment."
2325,8,"A few problems but Stellar Few spoilers ahead. If you haven't watched the movie beware I'm going to spoil it for you. Overall Black Widow was an action packed block buster that is a must see for the MCU. At the beginning of the movie this is the most tragic and sorrow filled back story that lasts about 10-20min. The middle of the film is very very slow but necessary for the plot that we knew wasn't going to be a Iron Man film that's almost all action. Some of the CGI was bad but is acceptable considering what the CGI is used for and can be looked past considering its in a few minutes of the film. As we know that the MCU is not going off comic book accuracy and shouldn't be because of how fresh their takes are in the MCU. Between the family bonding you see in the film between Red Guardian, Maria, Black widow and her little sister it makes you feel the emotion through out the film. Between the wonderful song choices and the color choices in many scenes it makes you feel connected with the movie all through out. With the gender bending of Task master and how her ""powers"" are explained is super fresh and interesting take on this comic book villain. The problems with this movie is that the tricks used are already used in multiple films with Black Widow in them, such as the face disguise as we saw in Captain America and the Winter Solider and then the electric gauntlets like in civil war, the CGI is acceptable with has obvious it was but for marvel movie it was still amazing. Another complaint of mine is that this movie is set in 2016 after Civil War but Natasha is more seasoned in combat than her appearance in Infinity war and end game. It is upsetting that Black widow is no longer in the MCU but her character was amazing in this movie.Now lets talk end credit scene, This movie is meant to be seen after civil war but has an appearance we have already seen in Falcon and the Winter solider Disney Plus series and if you haven't watched them you wont understand them. This is why I kind of have a problem with the post credit scene other than that you can see that we are going to be getting a villainy version of the Avengers in future MCU projects.Overall this movie was exciting, action packed. Cinematic master piece 8/10 from me."
2326,5,"Yeah about Taskmaster... Taskmaster as we know Tony Masters who is a mercenary who's natural ability is muscle reflex has such an interesting, cool and badass design. In this movie I could care less about Taskmaster being a woman if they only got the heart of the character right but sadly they did not :( They took a away a lot of what makes Taskmaster unique. His charisma, his dialogue and his motivation. What we got in the movie was just some kind of brainless slave. This version of Taskmaster was disappointing, but I hope Marvel will bring the original Taskmaster as Tony Masters in the MCU."
2327,4,"Mediocre at best I mean if Marvel wants to make a Black Widow movie then they should have focused on Black Widow but instead of doing that they made this movie for Yelena, Red Guardian, and taskmaster for future MCU installments. This movie had a plain and very predictable plot and had some unnecessary humor. It was so annoying when that lady from Falcon and The Winter Soldier deliberately sneezed to mock Yelena while mourning for Natasha. It was just pathetic. Most of the action scenes were forgettable and bland. They ruined the taskmaster completely by showing her like a terminator. Generally, MCU movies have good third acts but in this case it was a complete mess."
2328,5,"Unfortunately a bit disappointed I have been hyped for this movie as a huge mcu fan. The movie unfortunately was underwhelming. The comedy was pretty good but the plot lacked depth. The family parts of the story were pretty good, but the main plot was kind of lacking. The Taskmaster was barely active, and wasted potential. She only appears for about 3 fight scenes. The main villain Dreykov was very poorly written. He lacked emotion and any sign of a motive. This movie was pretty fun though."
2329,10,"Excellent Well worth the wait!! Great job!! I has mixed feelings before I watched it, but I'm very impressed!!"
2330,2,Worse marvel ever I couldn't watch this movie it was so boring. I forced myself to sit through 45 minutes it never got any better.
2331,3,"boring. Basically this is just a chase film. Very little story, tedious action stunts, paper thin acting... it's a throwaway film which is why Marvel probably didn't want to make it in the first place. If you're a fanboy you'll probably get through a pack or two of tissues but for anyone with an ounce of intelligence, give this a miss."
2332,9,"Ignore the haters It seems like as with Captain Marvel there are all kinds of people reviewing Black Widow who have an agenda other than really assessing the movie. It's a really fun movie and an excellent entry in the series. Ignore the people who are slamming it because it's not being true enough to certain characters from the comics - I have no clue, I don't read the comics - or are the same misogynists who don't think female characters should be allowed to assert themselves in relation to the patriarchy. Tony Stark can make obnoxiously objectifying comments about Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2 and none of these same reviewers have a problem with it, but God forbid she finally have her say. The related jokes in the film are funny and pointed, and as a middle-aged man I was happy to see it.Marvel does an excellent job introducing the new Black Widow and finally gives Johansson the opportunity to really shine as a full-fledged character in ways she hasn't quite been able to before. The performances of all three leads are excellent, and David Harbor is a lot of fun in his role as well.Make sure you stick around for the post credit sequence, which is poignant - it brought unexpected tears to my eyes in the theater - but also a bit humorous, and directly connects this movie with the Disney+ Marvel content."
2333,5,Mehhhh Time has passed for this really. Would have worked better prior to Infinity wars. Could of been any movie really if you removed the marvel characters.
2334,3,Felt very average. No memorable moments. I was very hyped for this movie too like everyone else. It was cool that they explained the backstory of Natasha but other than that it was super mehh.
2335,9,Awesome The only reason people hate on this film is because it is female led. The film is awesome!
2336,9,"Excellent addition to the MCU What a great movie. My bf and I saw it this afternoon and were not disappointed. I really don't understand the bad reviews! Scarlet was amazing as always and Florence was a perfect addition to the cast, she had some great one liners.All in all, a very enjoyable film and so worth the wait for the big screen!"
2337,10,"DON'T BELIEVE THE MYSOGYNISTIC, INSECURE REVIEWS & IN A THEATER Clearly this movie is not for MAGA type man babies who are easily threatened by strong women. (I am a male and I loved this film.)It's funny, action-packed and at times touching. Also, this is a big action film that is amazing on the big screen. Don't waste your money and detract from your experience by streaming on your TV, at least not on first viewing..."
2338,8,Enjoyed Black Widow Did not quite live up to the hype that was done for Black Widow. However still enjoyed the movie.
2339,4,"A boring slogfest. Slow, no real reason to do anything set up, no relatable characters, characters out of no where, boring back story, bad comedy, bad action, forgettable villains, and it goes on. Great character that deserved a better movie. Lemme ask SPOLIER ALERT! Couldn't she shoot him with a sniper rifle, so she wouldn't have to smell him?And please don't tell me they teased a sequel/spinoff/tv show based on the sister."
2340,10,"Amazing action, laugh out loud, good times I think quarantine has made everyone a little more angry and bitter because honestly this is one of my new favorite marvel movies. I hardly ever pay to go see a movie in a theater twice but I'm going to go see this again. DONT watch it on Disney Plus, your TV does not do the movie justice. The action is made for the big screen so go see it!!"
2341,3,"Falls flat, more of the same Too bad, I expected something more engaging but it's 70% drama. It was interesting to hear her back story because up until now, oh wow, she can kick fight. What an amazing superpower. Unless you count her ability to incur deadly injury and walk it off every time. There's more to it apparently but they were very vague about it. She did a good job overall though for what it was. It looks like they set up the next Clint movie/series but I don't hold up much hope for that since his superpower is... a bow and arrow. :/ Anyway, the movie follows the same worn out plot. Evil villain who gets away with stuff in the past, almost prevails against the hero but dies in the end. She saves a bunch of people, happily ever after. Until she dies in Endgame anyway. Definitely not a movie I would keep."
2342,9,don't compare It is not easy for any Marvel movie to be an extreme blockbuster after the Endgame. Pugh did a great job. Should have include more Avengers.
2343,7,Not what you expect It is a story of two sister and parents and not truly a high action Avenger movie. There is good action towards the end but it leaves you unsatiated.Overall I still give this movie a 7 because it does explain the background of Black Widow that we never knew.
2344,3,"Marvel women vs Harvey Weinstein is the real story of this movie. Black Widow is a classic and great marvel character. Scarlet Johansson plays the role brilliantly. This movie let's both the character and herself down.A character that strongly resembles Harvey Weinstein (fat, powerful, middle aged white man) controls women and makes them do bad things. But Black Widow saves them all. Each and every female in this movie is of good heart and a person to respect. Men are the idiots or antagonists. Very surprised at how woke this movie is.I stopped watching anything marvel after Brie Larson made hateful gender commentary about men. I watched this as I like the black Widow. But I made a mistake.Awful story with awful, weak characters and at the end the world is changing as women are now becoming Woke?"
2345,6,"Too fast paced, but great action sequences... For 2 hours, it felt like they were rushing through the back story a little too fast. There wasn't much room for character development. Regardless of that, the action sequences were extremely intense, thrilling to watch."
2346,7,I didnt expect a good movie like that. I was thinking it would be a bit boring for me but it was very enjoyable and dramatic. It was very good action movie and it was kinda like last farewell to old avengers.
2347,9,"Black Widow is GOOD - third act only issue This movie was so much fun, it was a different direction from most MCU films, it was dark and at times serious and very real-world with a great lesson about human trafficking and dealing with trauma.The only issue is the third act which is a huge wasted opportunity, everything sort of just happens. Other than that it's worth it to see it on a BIG IMAX screen."
2348,4,"The worst Marvel movie to date... It's baaaaad! Review from ""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies"": I love Marvel movies and Black Widow, but this was a YAWN FEST!! OMG.. could they have possibly talked more?! Is Black Widow's new defense talking people to death with the help of her family now? We're supposed to feel something for a family that we learn about in 20 minutes. This thing was sooooo lame.. and lacked excitement for most of the movie. Effects were good.. and visuals were as well, but the story line STUNK!! It was nearly as bad as taking an old ""Waltons"" or ""Little House on the Prairie"" script and giving it to Black Widow and her family. VERY disappointed!!"
2349,3,"boring What a lifeless mess of bad russian accents. And what's with Pugh's totally annoying acting? And with the choice of American Pie during the early scenes I realized this is not for me. Neither fun or interesting, just a waste of time."
2350,3,"No expectations There was not much expectation knowing Scarlet Johansson was in the main role. But even with no expectations, this is just one of the worst marvel movies, besides black panther. Lame jokes, boring dialogues, stupid fighting scenes... No tension at all. Another 2 hours of my life wasted, thanks Walt Disney!!!!"
2351,7,"Come on Marvel... All things considered... this movie is decent. It's a bit darker/grittier for a marvel movie. However, it still doesn't do much exploring into Natashas past.. there's a lot that's skipped over which is...disappointing. However the biggest disappointment of the movie is TASKMASTER. It's iron man 3 bad... what a wasted opportunity to bring in the actual character. They could have introduced a new character or used an actual female villain instead of what they did here.."
2352,8,Nice addition to the MCU! Nice to see a movie where an almost completely female cast makes total sense! This is how I think more movies should be made. Use a lot of women when it makes sense story wise and don't force them in roles where they don't belong. Action was also splendid! Really enjoyed seeing Romanof in a standalone movie.
2353,3,"Worst MCU movie so far I really tried to like this, but it just wasn't very good. Had this come out after Civil War it might have been slightly more enjoyable, but 2 years after the in universe death of Black Widow, it is pretty much a waste of everyones times."
2354,8,"Farewell Natasha! Ok. Florence Pugh killed it. She carried this movie. Scarlett was great as well, but something about Florence just hits different. Her acting is always a 10/10 for me. The rest of the cast was great. The story line was a bit wonky for me. The whole the red room not being destroyed when Natasha thought it was there threw me off the plot. I would've loved to have had this movie after civil war. I think it would've flowed better. All in all the movie was great. Packed with action scenes and Scarlett and Florence's chemistry made this amazing."
2355,8,"Not a typical MCU film, and that could be a good thing. This is probably one of my favorite MCU standalone films. The acting was pretty solid. In fact, Florence Pugh stole the show from the title character. But that is not to say Scarlet Johansson didn't do a good job, like always, she's always solid in that role. What I liked about this film was the story. It was less superhero focused, and more focused on Black Widow the individual. I think that was a good idea, instead watching another traditional MCU film, which is has been overused by now. I had a good time watching it, I just wish it came out sooner!"
2356,4,"Middle of the pack MCU film Black Widow is a mix of good and bad. First of all, it's nice to have Marvel back on the big screen. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh give excellent performances, especially Pugh. From a story standpoint, I wish the film would have gone more in depth about the Red Room and Natasha's background. I know this wasn't an origin film, but I think the movie would have benefited from greater explanation of the Red Room (instead of pictures describing it). I had high hopes for Taskmaster coming into the film as he is a beloved villain of mine. My only critique is the short amount of screen time we got from the character. The supporting cast of David Harbour and Rachel Weisz did an excellent job and provided some laughs. Overall, it was a pretty average MCU movie that will be worth watching when it pops up on TV. I will say, the mid-credit scene has me excited for Pugh's future in the MCU."
2357,5,"Meh. Overall, I'd say ""Black Widow"" slightly exceeded my expectations, although, admittedly, my expectations weren't very high. The movie is okay. The 134-minute runtime didn't drag like I thought it would, but it wasn't particularly good either. The comedic moments are fine, and the action is fast. However, the action does nothing new, and it can be a bit bland. The villain of the movie is also pretty lame.As an exploration of Natasha's character, it's ok, despite being years too late (spoiler alert: don't get too attached to her...). I guess it tells the story of her troubled past well, but it doesn't really add anything interesting to her personality. I don't feel any more of a connection to her character now than I did before watching. It essentially feels like the purpose of the movie is to bring Florence Pugh's character into the MCU, rather than coming from a genuine desire to tell Natasha's story. The multi-billion dollar MCU pushing industrialized, uninspired media out? It's crazy to think about, I know.As far as the acting goes, everyone was fine, although I thought the Russian accents were kind of awful. It's kind of disappointing to see Florence Pugh take her career in this direction though... At least Scarlett Johansson is free now.4.8/10Also, Jeremy Renner should have been in this movie."
2358,8,"Watch for yourself I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of bad reviews are from guys. Just like with Captain Marvel, men can't stand to see a woman lead a movie and criticize the dumbest, insignificant details. True fans will love it and not feel the need to dissect every little thing as if their some sort of movie critic expert."
2359,10,"WORTH THE WAIT What is wrong with you people? This movie was emotional, funny, had great action, and was the highlight of my summer so far. I can't wait to see it again. Ignore the bad reviews and go see this movie."
2360,10,ya'll are wrong Idk what these reviews are on about. THE MOVIE WAS GREAT! I loved it. Don't even need to say why. It. Was. Just. Great. WATCH IT. Dont read these other reviews they so wrong.
2361,8,"Great Supporting Cast I love my Marvel films. However, when it comes to ranking my heroes, Black Widow, along with Hawkeye, rank near the bottom of my favs list. The makers of this movie made up for that by giving us a great supporting cast. I want to see more of the Red Guardian in future Marvel projects."
2362,7,"Good movie The film is good and wonderfully dramatic for ""Black Widow"" Natasha Romanov and her character's past before she joined the Avengers with the presence of a character Elena and the presence of ""David Harbour"" and a comedic nature that added moments to the films. The acting performance of ""Scarlett Johansson"" and ""Florence Pugh"" were elaborate and wonderful, and the chemistry between them most of the film's shots was distinguished by the presence of the family element, which added a dramatic dimension and doubled the evil element and what was not a full-length movie from a movie, a full movie Nice movie, watch the movie before you watch it."
2363,8,"The Widowmaker. After the delay for it to be released, I booked a ticket to see the film in Manchester at the Vue IMAX (the second largest screen in Europe) Printworks on the opening day. As the days got near,I realised that due to the screening time,I would miss seeing the England V Denmark match at the 2020 Euro's!Having paid for the ticket ages ago,and interested in opening this new chapter of the MCU, I crossed my fingers that England would win, (well done lads!) and got set to at last met the widow.View on the film:Waiting in the wings since her head-turning entrance in Iron Man 2 (2010-also reviewed), Scarlett Johansson visibly displays delight in finally presenting Black Widow in her own solo film, with Johansson firing the MCU quips and performing the action scenes with a live-wire enthusiastic edge, which Johansson dual-welds with fractured emotions from the traumatic experience of the Red Room where she was forced to become a spy/assassin,and the lingering horror from seeing her family torn apart.Whilst Ray Winstone brings unintended (?) Comedy into proceedings thanks to his boo-hiss Russian baddie coming from the Sean Connery School of Accents, David Harbour soars like a Rocketeer as he spreads one-liners across the sky. Squeezing into the dusty, disused for 20 years costume of the Red Guardian, Harbour unleashes the comedy with a gruff warmth becoming revealed in the family reunion.Loaded with the same assassin skills as her sister, Florence Pugh makes Yelena stand out by hitting the physical comedy with a real glee that gently mocks the action moves of her sister, whilst at the same time, Pugh brings out a vulnerability to Yelena's fear of losing her family whilst inside the Red Room.Showing Black Widow at the beginning watching the 007 flick Moonraker on TV, (both have a sky diving sequence, and their baddies share a lair which hovers above Earth) director Cate Shortland & cinematographer Gabriel Beristain hint about what they later unleash in the explosive final set-pieces, which crunches long panning shots spinning along the shiny CGI of the Sci-Fi Red Room,with Spy thrills of brutal hand to hand combat sequences between Black Widow and silent assassin Taskmaster.Reuniting them after two decades apart, Shortland wonderfully captures the fragile re-building of the family bond with long wide-shots sitting in on Black Widow round the family table healing wounds that have been left open for years.An executive producer on the film, Johansson revealed that she wanted the movie ""To comment on... this incredible movement of women supporting other women, and coming through these shared experiences of trauma on the other side by really coming forward and supporting one another.""Whilst featuring a killer post-credit twist that links to the MCU, the screenplay by Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson place the emphasis on Black Widow heroically fighting through her experiences of trauma from when the opportunity to choose was destroyed in childhood, via now battling to support other women who have been traumatized in the Red Room, and with family by her side, Black Widow fights tooth and nail, in order to give other women the chance of a free choice."
2364,5,"Not what the character deserved, it could have been so much better if Marvel appointed the right people to make it. I actually have no problem with the first half of the movie, but the second half is not well written, it should have been a spy movie, Black Widow's powers are not surviving by jumping off a crashing ship, it's her hand to hand combat, her spy skills, how she infiltrates highly secured places, the last 2 min fight with all the widows was amazing, should have kept that longer and also more scenes between Widow and Task Master, this movie felt like it didn't have a villain at all, I genuinely wanted this movie to rock but turns out it's just there to establish Yelena (which I liked) and to propose future marvel projects, at the end of the day not a great farewell to Black Widow or Scarlett Johansson."
2365,7,Don't be fooled it's better than WW84 and Captain Marvel! I'll make this short and sweet.Positives: Great action set pieces that don't over stay their welcome. The plot isn't the most complicated plot to follow so newcomers wouldn't be lost. The acting is very good and I enjoyed Florence Pugh the most.Negatives: I wish the movie would have been a bit darker but since it's Disney I know that ain't happening. While the main villain is evil enough to be a villain they don't really show enough of them.As always never trust my opinion or others. See the movie for yourself and form your own opinion.
2366,3,"When Gender Takes Over From Talent Marvel is ruining all the great characters they have and they have very few interesting characters to begin with, compared to DC. Winter Soldier was ruined and now Black Widow. Since when is using sexuality a bad thing? James Bond does it and it is practical and looks great. China and a lot of other governments use it in real life. Action and Taskmaster was the most disappointing, especially because it had so much potential. Change of director and writer would have done wonders. A huge miss."
2367,3,Bad This movie is just bad. I don't want to see movies like this.
2368,3,doesn't meet expectations This movie is not on a standard mcu level. It is very dissapointing and i was expecting to see some quality actions with a quality story. All in all very shocked to see that this movies story is boring and dull. The so called Taskmaster doesnt really matter. The main enemy is having a boring mologue and is gone in minutes without showing any worthy villainous character. The so called family is a joke. The fights from the red guardian was just laughable. And black widow is shown in her worst possible state. She made a better character in the avengers infinity movie and endgame.It is actually not worth spending your time on this movie.
2369,4,"It met my low expectations Marvel had essentially two options here. Choosing to use a relatively minor character from the MCU that they already knew didn't carry a ton of fan interest would have given them a chance to really surprise fans with just an amazing storyline. Something that would blow fans away with cool lore reveals or new twists outside of the previous movies. Unfortunately, Marvel decided to entertain the second option, which was to meet the fan's low expectations with even weaker rehashed predictable storytelling. This movie offers nothing new from other movies and begs the question why not give a movie to other minor characters like Groot."
2370,1,"It was the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. I'm depressed. I watched all MCU movies, My favorite super hero was black widow. Unfortunately marvel, you couldn't make this movie. The script was awful. I really wanted to say goodbye to Natasha in this movie. But this movie was just a high budget action movie.Don't keep your expectations high."
2371,10,Great movie I like MCU(Marvel Cinematic Universe) all movies.And latest black widow movie is too good. And Scarlett Johansson acting superb. And thanks to Marvel Cinematic Universe releasing so many movies in this year. And iam much awaited for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness movie.
2372,8,A bit rough in the end but GOOD nonetheless. I loved most of the film. The ending was a little bit rushed or that's how it seemed. But a good film. I can see me rewatching this in the future in a chilled evening with a cup of hot tea.
2373,5,Unfortunately not very good It's not a terrible movie. Nothing new at all. Nothing that hasn't been done before. Salt. Bourne. That boring Russian ballerina movie with the hunter birds girl. Luc Bessons movies.Unfortunately the directing is very poor too. The editing is terrible. I can't blame the director of course coz I don't know how much freedom she was given. A monkey can direct a marvel movie and the masses will go watch it.
2374,7,"Feminist dogma & anti-heroes ruin anoher potentially good story (spoilers) Many others have complained about the lame storytelling and superfluous flashbacks. Those points are all valid. The two things that bothered me most about this movie are problems that seem endemic to most modern films, especially those lead by strong female characters.The first problem for me is the most basic. One of the most basic rules of storytelling is making your protagonist likeable. Natasha gets a pass on this count only because she's already been established as a heroic figure in the Avengers story arc. Based on her portrayal here, there's very little to like. She's basically a reformed assassin who shows very little remorse, even for having murdered a little girl.She's surrounded by equally flawed characters - basically a fake family made up of Soviet spies and a bunch of assassins. The fact that they were all 'brain-washed' is a lazy way to get us over that hurdle. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I miss the days when 'superheros' were people with heroic character who'd been gifted with extraordinary abilities or drive. Those characters are being lost in today's desire for 'anti-heroes' like Wolverine, Deadpool, and now Loki. I'm tired of it .The other current cultural flaw that infects this film is the apparent rule that any story featuring a strong female lead be populated with men who are either weak, corrupt, stupid, or all of the above. The women are universally strong, fierce, brilliant and relentless and the men are window dressing. There are only two principal male characters in the film. One is a two-dimensional misogynistic bully and the other is a muscle-bound, self-absorbed moron (whom we're somehow supposed to find likable).Again, I may be old-fashioned, but I don't think you have to paint all men as bullies or idiots in order to present women as heroic figures."
2375,7,"Not The worse MCU Movie. This movie wasn't that bad or that bad. The bad thing about is the Taskmaster I was okay when they changed the gender of it, but when they changed the complete backstory, from that I hated the character. I would say the best and funniest scenes in the movie was the one Alexei/ Red guardian in it or Yelena in it."
2376,2,"Are you kiddin me??? This is so lame. They basically copied everything the Avengers had,and made it Russian. They have the hover jet. They have their own version the S. H. I. E. L. D Air Ship. They have even their own Capetian America and Hawk Eye mashed into one robotic person. With shield and Bow. They even made the amour red white and blueReally was this the best you could come up with????Thew movie starts out fairly good, Some good fast paced action(Some of it a bit too over the top though) They seem to wanna go down the same path ,as they've done with Fast And Furious. They make their heroes too over the top.Natasha takes a fall from a great height, and hit every thing she possibly can on the way down. Yet she she just stand up and walks it off.Here's the thing .Natasha DOESN'T have super powers. You can call her super hero all you like,but the truth is she is the weakest of the Avengers. With no super powers at all,she is the weak link.She can hold her own in hand to hand combat with Humans, But that is the basic of her strengthThe fight sequences aren't all bad.Some of them are pretty good. Whenever they dare using a wide shot. Instead of up close. (which is rare in the movie) But they also, rely to much on wire stunt. Which I think is a bad thing. Some of it work. But a lot of it just get to over the top.Sadly the movie also has to many ""look at me pauses"" when they're about to do some action.Hollywood should learn From Old Jackie Chan movie here.He usually just did the moves. Mostly his moves floated into each other. Hollywood always have these moments where they pause, so the heros strike a pose for the camera. And the enemy just stand around gaping in awe.Like whenever Natasha jumps and lands. She lands with one foot out to the side. This may look like cool action in the comix. But in real life it doesn't work. They even make fun of it in the movie. Calling it a pose.The movie was mildly entertaining but the acting as very stiff in places."
2377,8,"What's wrong with other reviews ? I don't get why people rate this below 5/10 and below. It's surely good, just not great."
2378,8,"Entertaining and less serious than expected After the disastrous WW 1984 my expectations with BW were just low; however I was pleasantly surprised in many things and disappointed in others. Let's start for the best things.First of all the humor; this movie does not take itself too serious. Two characters; the clumsy innocent moments of David Harbour steals the movie as the lovable Alexei / Red Soldier (or whatever name his character was); a very strong but not very intelligent fake father.On a more cynical but equally effective note Florence Pugh / Yelena as the fake sister, make you laugh every time she says something. Both are really the heart and soul of the movie even when they are not doing jokes.I really had to admire Scarlet (also executive producer) to take a back step and let these two characters shine. She gives a decent performance but her character (sexy and violent) requires a more adult oriented movie than a PG 13 one.Second the action; even when some scenes are not that spectacular; the pace is always fast so it never gets boring.About the bad things; the clichés. Hollywood needs to stop with that.I am person of faith but people DO NOT CHANGE IN FIVE MINUTES. Bad guys (or women) can become repented but not that fast.Even with his mind managed; Antonia / Taskmaster will not forgive that easy the person who tried to kill her and destroyed her face. Nor that the Black Widows will become saints after being trained as assassins.In brief; is an entertaining movie with lots of action and joes; with sadly Hollywood style a lot of cliched writing. However is never boring."
2379,8,Fun avengers movie Scarlet Jo and Florence Pugh looked like they had a fun time making the movie. The action was Jason Bourne good. The bad guy was more sleezy than horrific. There's a lot of emotion included especially with the sisters. The character development is there which is sometimes missing in MCU movies. Also the locations and scenery were fantastic much props to the crew.
2380,7,"Typical marvel After seeing so much craziness in loki and wanda-vision. We are back to classical marvel. Storyline is moderate, a little bit too fast. A bit over dramatic and emotional. However, Action and music is great.To me this movie feels like a filler movie. A dedicated movie for black widow."
2381,6,"Oddly enjoyable but disappointing simultaneously The film isn't bad at all, per se, but doesn't really impact the main MCU story arc. The Easter eggs were fun, but I suppose I was hoping for the prequel to an OG Avenger, and one as underused in the franchised so far, to impact the overall MCU story line more - especially given the ending to her MCU storyline."
2382,8,It's not infinity war or endgame But it's a good story. I had a good time watching this.
2383,4,No Spoilers Florence Pugh Carried This Film Alone On Her Shoulders.Waste Of Time.
2384,10,"WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT I don't know why a lot of people have a problem with this movie. That it's too late for her? That the humor and cgi was trashy. It was not at all bad. For starters, I would like to talk about the villain. If anyone thought that this was wasted, listen up! I thought the taskmaster plot and who was under the mask was PERFECT. Not only was the villain dreykovs daughter, but she was being mind controlled. That was the perfect representation of what this movie was about. Natasha went back to her past so that no other women can ever feel that pain from the red room. She saved her and the other widows. This whole movie was incredible. Of course their was a little too much humor for a me too based movie for marvel, but the supporting cast, David, Rachel and especially FLORENCE, hold their own. The people who say that we end up feeling for the new characters and not for Natasha is completely wrong!!! We feel for all of them! More so to Natasha! And, the third act was not messy and the cgi was surely not a mess!!! Scarlett and Florence deserve Oscars!! Anyone can fight with me about this but it's what I think! WE FINALLY HAVE CLOSURE FOR NATS DEATH IN ENDGAME!!!!!!!!!This whole movie was incredible. Of course their was a little too much humor for a me too based movie for marvel, but the supporting cast, David, Rachel and especially FLORENCE, hold their own.

WE FINALLY HAVE CLOSURE FOR NATS DEATH IN ENDGAME!!!!!!!!!"
2385,5,"Cliché movie for boring Sunday. Hard to call this movie good or bad. Its filled with typical Marvel plotholes and cliché moments and dialogs that make this movie annoying in half of time.Story it self had potential but it hit the ground of flattening it so it could be digested by sadly lowered average IQ of modern viewer.Acting just like pacing and action scenes is mixed bag, they tried to push weird jokes in too much scenes, fighting is average at best, because of lower quality animations for marvel movies you get lots of weird fights and movements. Some scenes are totally useless or overexposed to point that you get cringed by it.Its not really that bad, but because of those plotholes, hit-and-miss jokes and fighting its hard to call good movie, it really feelt like one of those action movies that you watch on TV in boring Saturday in the middle of day."
2386,9,"Originally a 1 Star Review I admit when I am wrong. I watched this movie twice. In a word, ""hysterical"". I don't mean that sarcastically. The main characters played by Johansson, Pugh, Harbour and Weisz poke fun at themselves throughout. It made me laugh despite the Marvel franchises woke BS lately. Watch it. Then watch it again."
2387,9,A great addition to the MCU Black Widow was a great movie even by MCUs high standards. I was expecting a standard origin story like Captain Marvel or Ant Man buy this film uses alot of the laid ground work to tell an enjoyable spy revenge story akin to The Winter Soldier. The cast is charismatic and the movie has some genuine funny moments and great action beats. A must watch.
2388,4,Such a waste of good opportunities First the Harley Quinn shenanigans and then WonderWoman 1984 and then this... I was certain Marvel would do a better job but this is just... undescribable... I'm starting to doubt whether we should have stand alone movies for female superheroes...
2389,8,"It was ok alright. The movie is good,not every movie from marvel has to be like CW or WS,i Know it could be better but there is no way you can say this was a bad or boring movie cause it wasnt."
2390,9,A Great Movie and a sad world we live in! This was a great movie and some of the best action I've seen in the MCU. Good introduction for Florence Pugh and I really enjoyed David Harbour as Red Guardian. It's a female led superhero film so unfortunately it never stood a chance to get good reviews. People started to hate on this film just like they did with Captain Marvel. I have a daughter and it pains me to think she has to live her life in this world. Great Movie!
2391,5,"what is happening... Great start... would of been nice to see more of the childhood development of the character. Instead, we see mommy and daddy issues building a character. What a disappointment!Ugh... again, again with the woke and done the wrong way. All power to woke but not this way please. So there are blond Africans in Russian prisons. African surgeons speaking Russian. Ok! I'll give it to the brained washed widows speaking Russian, that makes more sense."
2392,8,"Heartfelt, Hilarious, Action Packed But A Flawed Story Black Widow is heartfelt, hilarious & action packed. The movie started off slow but act 2 was absolutely amazing. The story is very flawed. Clear Improvements should have been made. The action is great but it could have been better with less CG. Its funny & emotional. Florence Pugh and David Harbour's performance was fantastic. Pugh has great charisma and carries the film for the majority. David is HILARIOUS. Scarlet Johansson was great as well. She proved that she can carry her own movie. However there should have been more of an origin to the story. They just glanced over it a couple of times. Taskmaster didn't have much action but the action that was there was great. To much cgi for practical action imo. The 3rd act could have been better. The story is weak but it's carried by great performances, action, comedy, & heart."
2393,9,"Excellent Marvel Film! Really enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would.. perfect Marvel combination of action, heart and comedy. Some great acting and exciting storyline.A must match 🍿"
2394,8,Goodbye Natasha😓 I don't why a lot of people saying Black widow is a bad movie... in my opinion black widow is an awesome movie .. The acting was really really good and The action sequences were amazing ...also the movie have a lot of emotions which is a good thing because some of the mcu movies are lacking from it...and the only thing i have problem with is the CGI ...sometimes the CGI looks good but sometimes the CGI looks like a cutscene in a video game...and this movie is a goodbye to black widow but maybe she will comeback idk🙂
2395,8,"A lovely and touching denouement for our gal Black Widow I loved this film. It worked on a lot of different levels: as an adventure action film, a buddy movie, a droll and darkly humorous family film, a poignant social commentary, and a fine addition to the Marvel film universe. All the actors performed impeccably and the story provided Johannson and her fellow cast an emotional depth which really accentuates Black Widow's character arc. Tonally, ""Black Widow"" is brilliant. I felt the production team accomplished quite a lot with this multi-faceted movie."
2396,2,"Surprised they messed it up so badly. First off let's give credit where it is due, Scarlett did a great job as always a talented actress which is why it got 2 stars at all. The fight scenes were ok, but it fails when it comes to the story . We'll hold off the Taskmaster bit for a moment and just say this...they should have focused on Black Widow's backstory more and less on present BS that wasn't as good as the actual comic book stories.Taskmaster isn't a woman...nor was she part of the program that Black Widow was. HE has his own backstory that should have been fleshed out in a whole other movie.The whole BS with fight scene between Black Widow and the program's Director was feminist propaganda that wasn't needed or wanted."
2397,7,"Took you long enough... Dear MarvelTook you long enough to get around to doing this. Yes there was a pandemic and we should have seen this last year. But honestly, you should have had this movie out before Infinity War. It would have been better placed and the end scene could have been moved to Endgame. You could have made the end scene work much better there and had more of the rest of the cast to use on that scene.All flaws aside, this is a good movie. It stands as a spy/buddy cop/family team up movie. I really like how they added bits that hint at things mentioned in past movies, Budapest for example, without giving us a lot of exposition and fill in all the blanks type of thing.Having the credits was weird but also understandable as the montage filling in the back story would have been really out of place.My biggest problem with this movie...The overall feel of the movie is lackluster. Part of the motorcycle chase felt like it could have been from a TV show. There was so many things crammed into this movie as well, the base in the sky, I must have missed the explanation of the evil scientists ""power"" with the pheromones cause I am not sure if he is the MCU's first mutant or if he just wore it like an aftershave.I hate to say it but I really feel that this movie was mostly phoned in by Marvel production. Don't get me wrong, the actors did an awesome job, but the overall production feel just doesn't feel like the Marvel standard.This feels like it was made as an after thought, to placate the female led action flick requirements and to throw out ideas that didn't seem to fit somewhere else."
2398,2,Abysmal should have been re shot My 11 year old fell asleep that tells you everything you need to know as he is a Marvel film fanatic. The film is really poor like a straight to Netflix movie. The story is weak after all the mystery of Black Widows back story it's just dull. The supporting cast is working on scraps and the Russian accents are particularly poor especially Ray Winstone who slips into cockney at least once. The special effects are blurry and so outlandish that the movie feels silly. This is by far the worst Marvel movie I've seen by a long way.
2399,7,Didn't expect much out of it so not that disappointed but... 4 points for Florence and rest 3 points for everything else.-2 for ruining Taskmaster.-1 for not doing justice with the Red Guardian.
2400,1,"Hasn't added anything to the MCU The movie was directed and written by utterly incompetent people that have no resume to even be considered for a movie like this.All but one characters ( including black widow ) are very unlikable. Natasha has no flair like she had in all other MCU movies, she just comes over as bitter.The online likable character is The Red Guardian, although I am pretty sure that was not the crew's goal.Red Guardian comes over as charismatic, lite hearted and patriotic ( to USSR ).Nothing about the story is memorable.I would have bought the movie on disc but I will not because of the utterly anti male marketing that Disney used."
2401,10,"Some seem to hate it, some seem to love it. I LOVED IT Great film. The beginning especially gives you a real emotional and dark MCU feel. I hope Florence Pugh is in future MCU projects, because she killed this role! Marvel never ceases to disappoint. I understand why people didn't like what they did with Taskmaster and to be quite honest, I didn't either, but the great parts of this film outweigh that so much!"
2402,10,The best Marvel movie ever made That's all you need to know. This is a perfect superhero movie.
2403,10,Great film I absolutely loved this film. A fun filled action movie with likable characters. I can't wait to see these characters in future MCU films and tv series.
2404,8,"Good movie but not like endgame or infinity war I think that movie was good and it is as good as other marvel movies it tells a story from one fraction of her life and shows her another ""family"". Average movie from marvel."
2405,7,"Back to the cinema Maybe this was actually good because I was pretty excited to finally go back to the cinema, but it was better than I expected. Now I did have my expectations pretty low but it surprised me. The story isn't all that great or anything, there's some good little turns to make it more unique but overall pretty straight forward. There are some pacing issues but nothing that drags you out of the movie. The action, I mean it's high budget it was bound to be good, although some effects looked a bit , the action scenes are very well organised and choreographed. The movie does look nice overall, some odd placed camera angles, but visually impressive. Some of the comedy was put in wrong, it still got some laughs from the back row. The characters are meh, there is no real development for the character 'Black Widow', the development is based around the families relationship. Now this works pretty well actually, their chemistry is enjoyable to watch. I will say there are definitely some parts that rely on you to have seen the other movies, just a warning. And the end credits scene sets it up for future marvel things as always, but I don't know if I like where it is headings. Overall I did actually enjoy this movie despite being so critical."
2406,10,wonderful I dont get it why some people didnt like this brilliant movie:/
2407,6,So why didn't Black Widow get a funeral in Endgame?? Movie was okay but what was the point for it? I was really hoping MCU would pull off something spectacular with Widow. If it were some 'origin' movie that would have been great as well. So this means there can be more Black Widow movies with some pre-death stories right? And Iron Man can comeback with more movies pre-Endgame era?? Naah Black Widow/ Scarlett Johansson absolutely didn't deserve this after 10 years.
2408,3,So disappointed.. First of all this film was just boring. To much cutting between the scenes. Even black widow coudnt carry this horrible movie. They did Taskmaster so dirty that it hurts to see this character getting wasted like this.
2409,3,"It's so bad !!! One of the worst story ever. Trying too hard, there is no flow in the story, it's looks like a low budget movie :-("
2410,2,"Disney, a social engineering disaster playing out in front of us Hey Disney, remember your place is to entertain us. Not to tell us how to think. Even if you're right, I don't care. It's not your job. You forgot your place."
2411,8,Not so bad as people are reviewing It was actually enjoyable to watch...Not so bad as people are reviewing this...I actually don't have so much expectation to this movie thats why it make me feel good... Why people expect much??I also think that if Captain America or other avenger appears there the movies could be more enjoyable...But the storyline and everything seems really enjoyable.....And there is also a family bonding and emotional boding which also feels good...But yeah could be better... People always want more and more..
2412,5,"Good action flick but comes up short and extremely late to the game. As far as MCU movies go, this is gonna sit pretty far down on the list for me right next to Iron Man 3, BP and Antman 2. This movie should've 100% been in theaters before Infinity War as there were so many opportunities to allude to events forthcoming but I mean let's face it... there's no spoilers for this movie because we all know how it ends. No matter what, Nat is going to get away from Thunderbolt, she's going to survive the red room assault, and she's going to get the stealth jet she flies around in with Cap... which was sorely missed in this and would've helped carry along the ending at the very least. Unfortunately, this movie suffers from the trend of over girl-powering films in order to appease the woke mob. Having a cast that was 95% female made some sense, but you didn't need to replace taskmaster with a female cyborg. I get that it pushed a more dramatic story, but Taskmaster has a decent origin and could've been a strong recurring villain later on in Phase 4 or 5. Instead they used TM up in the worst way possible, defeating them with love.Watch it if you love MCU movies, but don't be confused by the poor reviews. MCU's woke approach is gonna start costing them big, and I'm all for it. Even the largest empires stumble and fall."
2413,10,"Chill Y'all Haters gonna hate, light a doobie, sit back and relax, its movie time."
2414,10,Great Black widow is a good movie for the return to the cinema. Marvel each time strives to deliver something different in phase 4.
2415,7,"Y'all need to chill out Seriously, some people are rating this 1-2 stars. Just ignore those. I am gonna tell exactly why this is worth watching and everything wrong with this movie.Spoilers Alert...!Okay, this movie is solid 7/10 just rating this 10 to balance the 1-2 stars hate which I am gonna tell you why it is receiving.Pros:First of all the opening credits absolutely mind blowing. You would feel that you aren't watching an MCU movie right from the start.Perhaps that's exactly how MCU would've been without Disney owning it but then we won't be having MCU at all.Secondly, the action is epic. Nuff said.Just watch the movie it is gonna feel so different than the rest of the MCU and I think that's enough to sell this.Totally worth watching and you're gonna enjoy it.Cons:Now, let's talk about why this film is receiving so much hate.Taskmaster is a girl. Yup that's it. Honestly, I think they wasted him. I mean such a great comic book villain just gone wasted. But is it enough to rate this movie 1 star? Hell no, sure I hate how one of the most epic villain is just mute throughout the whole film who is known for his savage dialogues, but this was Natasha's story and more or less he(she) was getting less relevant to the story maybe they should've used another villain but still it doesn't take away from your movie experience.Secondly, ya, there's an argument how everything does feel pointless cause Natasha is dead anyway. And I agree with that maybe this would've felt different if it came out just after the Civil War.Also, that pheromone thing was stupid. And maybe some people didn't liked that last action sequence and honestly it wasn't an action sequence to begin with.Overall, I am pretty satisfied with experience and I think it's worth watching. Also, don't miss out the credit scene."
2416,6,"Not What We've Been Waiting For! Following an excruciatingly prolonged waiting period; at last, we have a stand-alone feature on Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow. Except for Hawkeye, she was the only one from that OG Avengers team who hadn't got a movie dedicated to them hitherto. Having said that, I'm afraid it's not what we've been waiting for.Right from the beginning, I was noticing some incongruities in its narrative disposition. Which appeared to have an acute scarcity in terms of consistency and integrality. While it did have subtexts regarding Misogyny, Male Chauvinism, and all the other stuff of social relevance; the Screenplay bristled with its own quandaries had not been able to generate acceptable outcomes I reckon!I volitionally got myself invested in all this whacky family drama at the early stages in hopes of getting onto something more substantial. However; down the line in a quite befuddling manner, things started to get redundant and unimaginative! Only then I realized, this is not going to work out. Superficial character depictions and Incompetent Writing; these two main factors are to be blamed for. As a consequence; the entire narration fell flat and was unable to capitalize on the sentimental sides of the storyline.Such a constrictive way of storytelling reigns supreme anytime there's a bit of action going. Chase sequences, Fist Fights, Guns, Explosions, quick-witted Humor; all very conventional Marvel stuff but that's when it achieves the most. Not to mention, it has largely benefited from a bunch of impressive visual effects (for the most part) and a stimulating Score along the same lines.Speaking of Performances; Scarlett Johansson as the leading protagonist did the best she could, as expected. She's been consistently doing the same for years now, so no real surprise there. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz were welcome additions but they were gravely underutilized, serviceable at best. The standout was definitely Florence Pugh; without a doubt! I strongly believe her portrayal of Yelena soon gonna end up being a fan favorite.At the end of the day; I just wanna ask, is this even relevant at this point? As we are all aware of the fact that they have already eradicated the character of Black Widow from their Cinematic Universe. Therefore, she won't be playing any part in the next phase (Phase IV) whatsoever! So, Why now? Why not a couple of years back? Isn't it too late?"
2417,8,"Not for Scarlett Its for Florence Pugh Black Widow is the first film to hit theatres in MCU phase 4 and even the most anticipated film too . But for the expectation it might disappoint you a little . Movie starts of well in the beginning and that action sequence involving Scarlett is complete mad fan stuff and . In the middle there is a little family drama with fun of marvel's mark but that drama will test your patience definitely for even a Marvel fan Coming to performances Scarlett Johansson had done a great job , but there is show stealer that is Florence Pugh who nailed the complete show , we cant take eyes of her remaining all other actors had done a decent job , Coming to technicalities Cate Shortland had done a good job in extracting performances and production values are rich as usual and music is about okay Main Highlight : Post credit scene with Florence , Performances Drawback : Climax fight CGI should be taken care a little.Especially film is between Civil War and Infinity war before going to film you should watch civil it might keep you hooked removing all other marvel movies from your mind."
2418,10,"What a thrilling ride! The action and fight scenes are excellent! Scarlett Johansson is still feisty as the Black Widow. 10/10 Stars 👍👍 Marvel has done it again. My dad, brother and I enjoyed this film. I couldn't take my eyes off it. It's like I'm watching a James Bond film being mixed up with Marvel's action. David Harbour is awesome as Red Guardian. It's even great to see Taskmaster. Scarlett is awesome and cool as she does her own stunts. I believe she does her own stunts. There are emotional scenes and my dad cried during the film. There are twists and turns that became unexpected, but hey, that's what every MCU film is. I wish I can get a Red Guardian action figure because now he's my new and favorite superhero. I could watch this film over and over again."
2419,6,"Wasted potential Florence Pugh carried this movie on her back, that needs to be said.Overall I was quite happy about the movie until act III. I was expecting a movie more on the ""Falcon & the Winter Soldier"" vibe were the serie is purely based on plot & characters with minimum uses of CGI but this one... the CGI is just bad AND UNNECESSARY.This time ""less"" would of been a lot more."
2420,3,"A soap opera for $50 million Marvel movies have now become the new soap operas. The plot is basically as interesting as any soap opera any dim-witted 1950's TV writer would have come up with.Sure... you got your gadgets, and your weapons, and your sexy female assassins devoid of reproductive organs, and your moronically impossible weapons (such as the retractable katana that the main foe manages to get out of her ass... sorry rucksack), and your amazingly impossible fight stunts... but in the end, the ""meat"" of the script is that stupid pathos that fails to be anything more than a carbon copy of 1950's all-american BS soap operas.Nothing new... nothing old as well (they managed to botch every single detail of that 1995 flashback... writers who weren't even born at that time think that back then it would be perfectly fine for a 12 year old girl in Ohio would have blue hair or run around in a mountain bike... I guess this is a new trend in film-making: rewriting the '80s and '90s as you would like them to have been).Bottom line: this is a fun action movie with all the fantasy you have come to expect from Marvel, plus some over-the-top ridiculousness that actually made me laugh to tears, because of how outrageously ridiculous these stunts were.Big thumbs up goes to Pugh: undoubtedly the best thing this movie has to offer. She outshines Johansen AND Rachel Weisz (who, IMHO is an absolute goddess of the silver screen). Watch out for her. Something tells me she's gonna be a huge star, if she keeps it up."
2421,8,DON'T MISS IT BASED ON THE BAD REVIEWS ! THIS REALLY WAS A BIG SUPRISE PACKAGE ! I REALLY DONT THINK THAT THIS WAS EXAGGERATED OR SOMETHING ! THE ACTION IN THIS MOVIE IS SO FAR THR BEST WE COULD SEE FOR THE ONE LAST TIME FOR NATASHA !
2422,7,"A movie 3 years too late.. Or one that should have been released during the pandemic to give the world a distraction for 2 hours? Not sure which..On the face of it Black Widow is a good movie, great action sequences, enough of a story to make it mean something, a solid 6/10 if it's got a generic title, a different cast and not lifted by Marvel story from other movies that flow into this one. But it isn't that, it does benefit from the fact it is apart of the MCU as with all other movies which is why I give it a 7.However, this is a movie that is clearly 3 years too late, shoe horned in after the fact (Endgame) to supply some sort of deeper meaning to a B plot point from it and there to tie up some loose ends of previous throw away comments in Avengers Assemble.Summed up, the movie is inferior to the ""free"" content released on Disney Plus, is too little too late to add value to Natashas sacrifice in Endgame, the villain(s) join the forgettable ranks along with Yellow Jacket, Whiplash and the rest which is a shame as Taskmaster is a fairly interesting villain in the source material but just used here as fodder to the Widow programme story.It's rare I throw this much criticism at a Marvel project but defiantly holding this movie back for a cinema release when it's nearly another 6-7/10 generic Marvel piece is confusing and disappointing."
2423,6,"Mid-tier Marvel: a serviceable action flick with some wasted potential Black Widow is an odd-duck of a movie. At the time of writing, it's the newest entry in the MCU, but feels like one that should have been made 5 years ago. It's a spy thriller, but with twists and turns that can be seen from a mile away. It's meant to finally put the spotlight on Johansson's Black Widow, but her character takes a back seat whenever Florence Pugh or David Harbour come on screen...Unfortunately there's not much to offer here in terms of story, thanks in large part to the fact that we know how Natasha's journey plays out in previous films. After the exciting prologue, the 1st act of the movie is a bit forgettable and what happens in the 2nd and 3rd doesn't feel like it has much impact. We're told how bad the bad guy is, but the writers never provide a sense of urgency or give the audience a demonstration of why he needs to be stopped (aside from, you know, him being a bad guy). On top of that, and without spoilers, the most interesting nugget of story is handled as contextual dialogue between two characters, where this particular beat would have been great to actually see on screen. With all this in mind, by the end it left me feeling like there was so much wasted potential here for a truly great spy thriller.Speaking of ""thrills"", it's not an MCU movie without big 'ol action scenes. The best set pieces here, came in the form of impressively choreographed, Bourne-inspired, ""street level"" brawls. They felt hard hitting (pun intended) and visceral. Ironically though, the bigger the scope gets later in the film, the less impressed I was. A demonstration that more doesn't always equal better.Aside from the wanting plot, twists and 'splosions, the movie succeeds in its characterisation, particularly with MCU newcomers, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) and Alexei (David Harbour). These two steal the show and provide a much needed boost of energy and heart to an otherwise artificial experience. That's not to say Scar Jo doesn't bring her A-game: she goes above and beyond what she was given to work with, but at times it feels like an injustice that her character is written as the one to reel in the more quirky and exciting characters, and always in control of the situation - never quite letting the audience buy into any kind of ""struggle"" the protagonist is facing.All in all, the ""quieter"" moments in between set pieces is really where the movie shines and entertains the most. The MCU always succeeds in making us excited for what comes next, which is definitely the case here with some of the new characters introduced. I just wish we were given a bit more to chew on with this outing, especially considering how long audiences have been waiting to see it."
2424,8,"FINALLY. Action-packed. This movie gave a family feel to the lonely Natasha. Filled with action, comedy, drama, love, and intrigue. I love Black Widow and enjoyed learning more about her past. Girl power yeah!"
2425,5,"Being too safe is the biggest problem in the movie In short, it was an okay movie. Not bad, but not good. Part of this is the timing of release- we know she will be dead in the near future, so the stakes do not seem very palpable. This could have been a much more compelling and flavorful movie, but instead we got another fast film that primarily serves to move to larger plot of the MCU along."
2426,7,"I need more Yelena. With the opening credits looking like something out of a Bourne movie, I was kinda worried how the movie would play out.But turns out, its just the movie ""I"" was waiting for.The whole cast was great, but Pugh was the real star here.Yelena is so very transparent, you can't but love her.And by transparent, I mean blunt and honest in character.""We are both upside down"".Or when she lands the superhero pose she mocked Natasha for, her skin crawls with an audible ""yuck""!We are teased to a crossover with Hawkeye, which I can't say I'm expecting much from.But I hope it progresses towards Pugh becoming the Black Widow for future installments of the MCU."
2427,6,"actually better then i expected What did you expect from your basic soviet assassin comics character ? I did not expect much and was pleasantly surprised. They squeezed even some depth out of 2d person Scarlett is. I was afraid they will go into full cliche ""red paranoia"" but they made decent Tv-movie. Still lots of logic flaws and open ends, so just 6."
2428,4,"Marvel starts do make comedies. I loved to whatch all Marver movies and Tv shows. There are still some serious projects but in last time instead of good action I am watching comedies. Pleas Marver, start to do actions in future again."
2429,8,"Enjoyable, 8/10, with questionable choices The movie is after Sokovia, Natasha goes underground.It was interesting to see her backstory and family, it is the backbone of the movie.Every superhero movie is just as good as the villain.Taskmaster and the red room organization was a good idea, but after watching the movie i feel like that there was a lot of potential for giving Taskmaster a more detialed backstory becasue you dont really connect with the motivation therefore you feel the character empty.There is a lot of action in the movie and those scenes are top quality.The twists in the movie are somewhat predictable but the twist with Taskmaster is the only part what is questionable for me.Overall i think it was a good MCU movie for enjoying a saturday afternoon, helped you know more about Black Widow and the end credit scene was connected to the Captain America and The Winter Soldier series."
2430,7,"Entertaining but a bit silly Rather entertaining with lots of intense actions, fast and well choreographed fights. The story is however kind of generic, with too much family stuffs as well that makes the movie kind of silly, and the acting is a bit loose which affects its credibility. Also a bit too much companions while the antagonists are somewhat lacking and underwhelming without much wit that could be disposed with little effort. CG is decent enough but wasn't the best, overall an average movie in the mcu, which is better than childish movies like homecoming, captain marvel and black panther, but under iron man, doctor strange and guardians of the galaxy etc."
2431,10,Good Marvel movie My daughter and I went to see this today and loved it 😍
2432,3,"Weak First, let me talk about basics.All super hero movies created by Marvel and DC are alike in many respects. They are all well made, with a lot of action, good actors, great special effects and mostly good stories.But the big differences between Marvel from DC is humor. Marvel movies are funny. And they are not just full of simple gags. They have good and very original comedy. Just think of Guardians of the Galaxy. Those two were funny from the beginning to the end, and all their characters were memorable, likable, well connected with one another. DC's only two attempts at making their movies funny were Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey. Both failed miserably. They were fully of gags that were not at all funny. Their were like an amateur comedian's act, you know, where the guy is standing on stage in front of the big audience, sweating profusely, telling jokes and laughing at them while everyone else yawns.There was a whole slew of things wrong with Black Widow.The story was weak, and I am being kind here. Well, maybe the original comic was good, but the execution of that comic was anything but good. The action in some places was simply ridiculous. I can see Captain America or Vision jump off the tall building and land safely, but when a non-enhanced person like Black Widow falls for a ten storey height and hits every metal object on her way down and then rises with a itty bitty scratch on her hand, that makes you share your head. There were moments when I thought Optimus Prime would form himself from the falling rubble and say something heroic in his poorly disguised Irish accent. Even 007 movies try to make their action somewhat realistic.David Harbour was the only bright spot in this movie. He was really good and its mostly because of him I rated this movie with 3 stars. A side note. It's nice to see him in comedic roles. He managed to make another bad movie - Hellboy - watchable. Unfortunately, David Harbour couldn't save Black Widow. It was just not enough.Until I saw this movie, I thought the weakest one in the whole Marvel movie universe was Captain Marvel. But now I believe Black Widow has taken its place.It's really sad, you know, this strange lack of good writing. Makes me wonder. If they could make Loki, a wonderful TV series, why couldn't they do a better job with Black Widow.Oh, one more thing. To quote one of Deadpool's jokes, couldn't the studio come up with at least one famous mutant? Not a single character from the Avengers universe (I mean main character, General Ross doesn't count) made a cameo in Black Widow."
2433,10,"really great Even if she didn't had a magical power like the other avengers, her movie is still memorable and the cinematography was so good. Scarlett Johansson's acting skill is so good in this movie. Overall this movie was so great and enjoyable!!"
2434,6,"What a Waste on Taskmaster! Black Widow is a good action packed movie with more drama in it. Actions is similar in scale that of the Ant Man movies, maybe less than sometimes. However the character Taskmaster is a pretty much wasted and twisted. There are some twists in movies which are interesting for viewers but in this movie Taskmaster doesn't do anything. And the final scene is pretty much nothing compared to other Marvel movies. I wonder what they were thinking when they wrote the script. It's disappointing to watch for any Marvel fan when we know what Taskmaster is capable of. This is a bummer."
2435,9,"A good movie It is a pretty good movie. From this, I understood that our parents love us without any condition. Even if we hated them. And any brothers or sisters can get friendly again after a fight. Family is at the top. This tells more about the great value of the family."
2436,6,"Pillow stuffing. It's not bad and certainly watchable. It doesn't really drive the overall narrative of the mcu forward, it's a good filler while we wait for other things to come out. It's essentially a place holder. Florence Pugh for the win in this movie and liked the bits of humour. Solid 6."
2437,7,"Great cast, not a bad ending but lacks of big action sequences I expected more but this is great. Taskmaster had little screen time."
2438,10,"Unique MCU Film! Must watch To start, not sure where the negative reviews stem from - but most are very misogynistic. I say this as a man myself; They'll praise male heroes for having very simple plot lines, but the same ones say this movie had a 'boring' plot. Black Widow had themes of human trafficking & the dehumanization of young women, and apparently that's boring for them because it's advocating for real global issues and not a story about something cheesy..Anyways, action sequels were top notch that was not a surprise considering the well-known stunt coordinators they hired. Casting was close to perfect, Scarlett's had 10 years to truly embody Natasha & this film was a perfect send off, it actually made me like Natasha more, she was never one of my favourites always just in the back for me but after the movie I was proven wrong. Helena as everyone else says was FANTASTIC, I am very excited to see her future in the MCU what a great addition! The opening credit was different from any Marvel movie we've seen, soundtrack was spot on.Only reason I give it a 9 is because Taskmaster was a wasted potential, he was such a well-written Villian in the comics they could've done much more with him.When reading bad reviews, remember that most of people's opinions are formulated on other's opinions - it's a hate chain, it's not real. Watch the movie for yourself first and then decide, but I personally do think the hate is biased. Iron Man 2 was not a good movie, weak Villian & story but didn't get nearly as much hate as this because it Tony Stark/Iron Man, but this film doesn't come CLOSE to that movie. Well-directed, perfect cast, great plot, good pace, overall such an enjoyable film and the feel of it was so different from other MCU movies. Loved it."
2439,5,"Forgot about it the next day Black Widow (2021)After all these lackluster TV shows, MCU has finally released a movie which sadly feels like a footnote about a secondary character that carries no weight. Taking place after Civil War, Natasha and her spy family try bring down the man responsible for creating the Widow program which controls orphaned girls into becoming killing machines. The film has a sick intro, a balanced start and a jam packed ending that feels rushed and somewhat anti climactic by the MCU standards making it all feel exactly like a second rate story about a second rate hero that came out 5 years too late.What often triggers me in Hollywood movies is when they poorly try to fit two languages into the plot which ends up being ridiculous. The mysterious language they were attempting to speak would be something close to how a 2 year old infant or a 95 year old toothless grandma would speak Russian because I couldn't understand a single word. If the film insists on creating this international spy vibe, the actors should at least put some effort into it. It kills the atmosphere and makes the movie look amateur when someone says a sentence in Russian and gets an English reply, or when the words on screens are bilingual.On top of this, we get huge inconsistencies in the narrative that jumps all over the place. The excessive action would suggest that we are watching a Captain America film because Natasha is clearly on some super serum based on how she falls from buildings and gets thrown all over the place. They could have gone for a slick spy-thriller style that would have used her agility, marksmanship and stealth but instead it was boom bang boom.I didn't hate the film but it all felt simply meh for a superhero flick. David Harbor was my favorite character as he was organic, honest and provided a few laughs. Florence Pugh did a fine job as well but Scarlett herself was flat and forgettable. The film had interesting villains but in the classical Marvel fashion, they got about 2 minutes of development. I also wished they would have shown Black Widow during her real spy days as the intro suggested but I guess that was too much to wish for.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows."
2440,4,"Weak script with less-than-stellar directing This is an origin story for Black Widow, and it feels funny watching it after seeing her sacrifice herself in Endgame. It has the same backstory as many ""sleeper agent"" movies (Red Sparrow and Salt come to mind) but Black Widow only glosses over this.Instead of a solo outing, Black Widow introduces five new MCU characters, and the script does not even come close to presenting them in any compelling manner. The audience understands why Thanos did what he did in Infinity War. It made him an ambivalent villain through good storytelling. In Black Widow, Dreykov (the villain) gave a short exposition two-thirds in, and that scene made him into a one-dimensional megalomaniac, like one out of an old James Bond movie.William Hurt showed up for perhaps 30 seconds in the beginning of the movie and another 10 seconds in the end. His character made absolutely no impact on the story (think about the last scene). Removing those scenes may have made the movie slightly less incoherent.Good: Good performance from the actors.Bad: Un-compelling villains, under-developed characters.Ugly: Jump-cuts - you really don't need to move the camera for every sentence uttered or when every time someone gets punched or kicked."
2441,8,PUGH PUGH PUGH Full action packed & Pugh acting & action scenes was so promising.Pugh carried the whole movie.She will become the next Black Widow. And probably marvel is going to make a tv series about black widow & hawkeye.Giving this 8/10 for Scarlett Johansson & Pugh.
2442,7,"Good, but not great Black Widow give some insight and answers to Natasha's background. Ans a number of scattered easter eggs link it to her previous appoearances in the Marvel universe. Many are saying that Johansen's co-star, Pughtwas the better of the two in this outing. To a certain extent that may be true, but there is no doubt that Johansen holds her own throughout. Pugh plays Natashia's ""Sister"" - at least for several years they were raised together with a Mom and a Dad, the opening scene is in a cofy surburban home in Ohio. Things descend quickly and we pick up the ""sisters,"" long seperated, many years later. Lots of action, as to be expected from a marvel film, and do hang aroud for the tag after the credits, which lets us know there is another film in the works. I enjoyed the filme but had hoped to see more of Natashia's training through her youth. IUt is a worthwhile view, just don't expect it to come up, fully to other Marvel films."
2443,1,"Worst MCU movie Weak plot,weak script and has a problem with the CGI,such a dumb MCU movie."
2444,7,"BLACK WIDOW Black Widow is not the best movie in the MCU, but it's not as bad as 'Thor the Dark World'. For me it's 3.5 out of 5. The best part of this movie is the actors- Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour. They play brilliantly as family members and how can we forget Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.Let's talk about the villain, I guess Taskmaster is just there to copy other avengers moves. Ray Winstone is pretty good but he has a short role . The ending is sad and the post credit scene is exciting and teases the mind blowing future of marvel. It's not a funny movie but you get a chance to laugh."
2445,9,"Finally this movie premiered... and it was worth it... 'till now... the best ""super heroine"" movie. First and second arcs a good spy movie in the style ""Jason Bourne"" and ""007"", in the third one assumes a hero movie. Great performances, action scenes and dramas. Dispensable villains as always and the Marvel formula once again visible and working. It's well worth the ticket. A shame that the timing of the movie would have been better during the Civil War and Infinity War movies... 'cause of the conclusion that we know..."
2446,1,Painfully Bad I can't even complete explaining how much stupidity this movie has. And every single problem any MCU movie ever had was filled up in this one even more.Probably the worst of MCU.
2447,2,Fell Flat. They over feminized it and the gender swap of Taskmaster was cringe af. It fit the story but the whole screenplay was trash. Florence Pugh carried this movie. About 5 years too late. This movie should've been made & come out after Civil War. Such a shame that Natasha never got the justice she deserved. Whole movie felt dry and empty of that Scarlett Johansson charisma that we all loved from past movies. Worth watching once but you'll be disappointed if you're a hardcore MCU fan.
2448,10,Black widow Vey good movie has a lot of action in it and the story line is really amazing.
2449,6,"Good but not great The scope is much more focused and isolated than the previous couple Avengers movies and Spider-Man. I think that's important to remember to temper expectations on this solo one-off movie.the action is fun but is more Jason Bourne in style (as others have called out). This is largely a skill-based hero and villain movie vs characters with actual super powers.I liked the family dynamic of the four central characters. Florence Pugh was particularly enjoyable with snarky quips and understated delivery. I look forward to seeing her Yelena in other MCU properties. She was the highlight of the movie.The direction they took Taskmaster was the low of the movie for me. I'm fine with straying from source material a bit. But it didn't improve the character... who is very enjoyable in the comics.Overall, good but not great. Definitely watchable."
2450,10,"Spectacular This is the story that we wanted. Thank you, Natasha Romanoff, we will miss you."
2451,2,"Totally Pointless Waste of Time Absolutely awful. So boring. Black Widow hanging from a helicopter looked so hokey. The red mist from the vials was the worst CGI I have seen in the modern era. Totally pointless, not funny, not entertaining, a total train wreck and embarrassment for the Marvel franchise."
2452,10,"People didn't understand who the real villian is. First of all, these reviews stink of misogyny.Scarlett killed. Pugh killed. Harbour was precious. Weisz' deadpan was hilarious. The fight scenes were brutal but trackable unlike the over CGI-d fights we've seen in the past. They should've made this movie ten years ago, but the audience is now invested in Nat, which is what Captain Marvels movie was missing.Taskmaster isn't the villian. Dreykov is the villian for God's sake. He's the one who took their free will, controlled the widows, he's on the one trying to control the world. Taskmaster is first Nats victim and now his. Everyone's arc is this movie is about redemption and recovery. They white washed THANOS and you all are pressed about Taskmaster...its exhausting. Stories are constantly changing in the Marvel Universe, why can't they change for the big screen too.This was one of the best Marvel movies. It's outside the usual realm, violent and dark like Nat's past, but with the sweet underlying message of choosing your family, choosing your own path.If you didn't enjoy this movie, it's because you chose not to enjoy it, and no one can help you with that."
2453,5,"Carried by lovable actors but even they can't overcome the silliness After two years without a movie, this was a disappointing ""below-average"" Marvel experience. Questions I have: What's with the over the top action scenes that look like something from Fast and Furious? Natasha will never die when she can simply jump out of any window and always find a railing grab. Or hang from a helicopter and pluck people with seemingly super-human strength.If this weren't a Marvel movie (which it doesn't need to be since it does nothing to expand the overall MCU story), I'd probably give it a 3 or 4."
2454,4,"Just a disappointment I have always thought that Black Widow has been a good character but this movie was just poor... I thought the intro was really cool and it didn't feel like anything else we have seen in the mcu. But after the intro we got a rushed movie, with a poor plot and characters you never really connected to. I also thought the mcu Taskmaster was bad and wasted. Taskmaster had some cool scenes but it didn't live up to the mcu villian standard. The second and third act felt rushed and forced. I was expecting more flashbacks like Budapest but they never lived up to my expectations. The third act was litteraly a joke it was just POOR and overexaggerated. I believe if this movie came out in the beginning of phase three after civil war it could have done better but coming out now when we have seen the new series like Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki it couldn't match the same standard. It wasn't even a good.tribute movie to Black Widow, I'm just disappointed... but I look forward to the new movies coming out in phase four because they can't be worse than this."
2455,7,"Good acting and story, spoiled with the CG It's a marvel movie, you'd think with all the big budget and the fantastic story telling and the cast you'd get great CG effects to compliment the story .. Crappiest big budget CG for a movie of this calibre.. Nevermind that, loved the comic and action sequences.. top notch.. Please work on your CG quality.."
2456,4,"It's Alright Action scenes are reasonably good, but nothing memorable.Fight scenes are a little dull. Characters not fully utilised.There's quite a long dialogue section in the film which I felt could have been condensed down. Didn't need to be that long and got a little boring.I'd say it's a reasonable good film and 6/10 is a fair score.But then they gender swapped Taskmaster. Don't get me wrong, women should be empowered and absolutely be equal to men.But for the love of God, stop swapping genders in bloody films. It's boring and tedious. For that, it's an immediate loss of 2 points."
2457,9,"Great movie! Not sure where the low ratings are comin from?! I read the the reviews. I went in expecting to hate this movie, especially because I'm not a big Black Widow fan. (""Meh, she's okay"" kind of thing) But, man! This is a good movie! It's what a movie should be. Very well done! I thoroughly enjoyed it. My wife did as well. I'm really not sure how anyone could rate this movie so low? I think the people who rated this low just hate their own lives LOL! Watch it. It' really is a good movie!"
2458,7,Not usual marvel movie This is completely full of more or less boring characters. Seems to be almost intentionally made as to not be the usual marvel movie. It is not at all what you expected and therefore it seems almost like it is failing even though it's an enjoyable movie. I'm recommending this movie but don't expect it to be like any other recent marvel movie and it seems like it was playing down to the viewer at times. I felt like a lot of the more enjoyable parts were intentionally dumbed down which was totally unnecessary and done just to be different.
2459,10,"Good movie It's better than what the critics are saying. This is not a bad movie. I have a few tiny nit-picks, but overall a good film. My favorite part was anything with Florence Pugh as Yelena."
2460,8,"Well done! The only problem I had with it was the VFX. Some action sequences were too unbelievable. With that said, the fighting scenes were great, unlike anything I've seen in a while. There were some surprises, which was nice. And Pugh?! Jesus she's awesome. Like, how did I not know about her. I'm glad Black Widow wasn't overly feminine or sexual. Also, it had some perfectly timed humor. Well done!"
2461,8,"Another fantastic MCU movie Black Widow is yet another fantastic MCU movie that does Natasha Romanoff justice, lots of great action scenes, new interesting characters esp Yelena and Red Guardian, overall another fine addition to MCU universe."
2462,7,"An expensive homage Black Widow Movie Review ALMOST NO SPOILERTHIS IS A James Bond ESQUE ESPIONAGE THRILLER WITH FAMILY TWIST. This movie is directed by Cate Shortland. It has Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Rachel Weisz as Melina Vostokoff, David Harbour as Alexei Shostak, Ray Winstone as Dreykov and Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster.The movie is a prequel to the story of Natasha Romanoff of the time between the movie Captain America: Civil War and Avengers Infinity War. The movie shows her past activities and her relation to the Red Room fellows and her ""family""This movie is overhyped unnecessarily. An expensive homage to a character that could've been rectified in the Endgame. But they did not. This being a MCU movie will have dramatic showing of how women are underestimated and traumatized in the world. However this movie also shows the MCU definition of family where anybody could be family who is worth fighting for. The story was so predictable that what I imagined came to be true with a little very twist. The family was created for accomplishing a task and after the task the family was broken and they were punished in a different way than regular way. But defeating all odds, the family got together and defeated their boss. This is what happened but with all the action shenanigans and drama bits. What disappointed me was the real face of Taskmaster. They pulled another Wanda Vision scheme for Taskmaster. However I have to appraise the opening credits which is one of the best if not one of the best opening scenes of MCU. The action was excellent. And the end credits were very important for future of MCU.Black Widow is a shakeup in the Marvel slate. It's more of a spy thriller than a superhero movie and another proof that anything is possible with family. The actions were super synchronized and awesome. However it struggles to strike a balance between family and drama. But Natasha got a befitting end for her story.Personal Review: 7/10 Rotten Tomatoes: 82%"
2463,7,"mixed feelings. This movie taught me to lower my expactations as much as possible.It was a good movie, entertaining, funny in some ways, would I watch it again? No, I wouldn't.The action in this movie was great, the costumes were perfect, and the plot twists were exciting.Over-all the movie needed a little more wow factor, it was somewhat underwhelming considering it took Marvel 10 years to give Black Widow her solo movie.Pugh and Johansson had amazing chemistry, hope to see them together again."
2464,7,"Black widow!! A rather beautiful movie, even if it contains high fictional scenes and sometimes exceeded imagination, but it is worth watching. Thank you."
2465,5,"Marvel meets WWE - - But still better than WW84 The first half of the movie feels like a Marvel Film with nice character development, smart dialogue, and creative and exciting action sequences, especially the motorcycle sequences.The second half of the movie feels like a slick WWE production where the action sequences become routine and the dialogue and convenient plot devices serve as nothing more than a generic propulsion system for the loud climax.All in all I did enjoy Black Widow although it was slightly disappointing to see a legendary actor like Ray Winstone fall in and out of a Russian accent like Keanu Reeves attempting a British accent.The ""severing"" of the olfactory nerve was just silly and even more ridiculous when Natasha simply realigns her nose to fix it.Considering the CGI standard set in Infinity War and Endgame, I was shocked to see that some of the CGI was poorly executed, Natasha's auto wreck on the bridge is a prime example.Surprisingly, Natasha's intelligence as a super spy and leader of the avengers is sacrificed throughout the film and she consistently makes silly decisions that only serve to unnecessarily prolong action sequences. Why not create exciting action sequences that capitalize on her skills and problem solving rather than minimize her character's capabilities and reputation.One last thought, as many times as the word ""avengers"" is mentioned throughout the film, it almost felt like a psychological writing technique to ensure the audience is still programmed to be Marvel loyal. Either that or they felt it was a cheap way to remind viewers that this is a Marvel film.Overall enjoyable even if it became a loud heartless mess at the climax."
2466,2,"Un-marvel-ous Well that was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Corny, predictable and unfunny...oh and lots of boring, slow and monotonous bits. Seems writing screenplays has suffered a viral infection where imagination had been put in lockdown and isolation. Totally un-marvel-ous!"
2467,8,"Better than I thought it would be I quite enjoyed this, the four family actors all seemed to bounce off each other well, Scarlett Johansson was outshone by the rest though especially Florence Pugh and David Harbour. I do agree that the villain didn't have a big enough part in it, maybe after casting Ray Winstone they realised they made a mistake so gave him as little screen time as possible, nothing against him just didn't suit the role imo. Action was good not all over the top. Give it a go."
2468,7,"Good but not enough! In as much that I enjoyed the actions in the movie, I have some concerns which made me not entirely in for it:1. Taskmaster gender changed, I don't know what they are thinking but at least maybe they should have named her Taskmistress???2. Taskmaster mimicking ability isn't a disorder like I have always known but a technology, though I was a little impressed but doesn't cut out for me.3. Taskmaster was been controlled, I have always known Taskmaster to be in charge but now they are telling me she/he is under some mind control, I have a big problem with that.I will drop my pen here and give this 7/10, they really tried but...."
2469,8,"I am sure that Elena Belova will become a wonderful new Black Widow and such a turn will always carry a tribute to Natasha Romanov. I liked the film, it's about the story of Natasha, although there is not much history there, I would like more, although the film answers many questions, it did not answer everything, but still, the film made the story of Natasha more clearly and understandable.In the film, we were introduced to a new heroine, Elena, who will replace Natasha in the role of the Black Widow, and the scene after the credits has a huge meaning, the actions take place in the cemetery, Elena Belova came to mourn and visit her sister's grave, but then suddenly Valentina Allegra De Fontaine showed up. Then Belova began to resent the fact that Fontaine was disturbed during her vacation. But Fontaine told her that she just wanted to say goodbye to Romanoff, Belova did not believe her, saying that she had come to give her a new mission. Fontaine confirmed this with a laugh, then Belova replied that she needed more money. Fontaine said that she also wants to, but she still said that she would get, or rather earn. Having convinced her with words that she could avenge the death of her"" sister"", she showed her the goal that needed to be eliminated. This goal was Clint Barton, whom Fonten declared the killer of Romanoff.I was touched by the scene where Natasha talks to Elena and opens her soul and says that everything was real, I even began to feel the rhythm of my heartbeat.I want to say that I can't agree with those who consider this movie tedious, long and boring, although I understand that everyone has a different subjective opinion. I'm not a big fan Marvel, but when watching this movie, 5 minutes seemed to me for 1, there were moments when Elena trolled Natasha (with funny phrases that you can laugh at) it was very good, these moments diluted the film during the battle scenes, so the film did not look boring.The villain in the film turned out to be what it should be, a passing one, but the antagonist, Taskmaster, was merged, but this could be expected, because the film is about Natasha's story, and a good antagonist would draw attention to himself.The action in the film is very good, I watched the film without complaints, the staging of the battles was not."
2470,10,Mind blowing action scenes This movie is very heartwarming. The action scenes were amazing and mind blowing. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha is too good.
2471,10,"It Makes Sense to Its Character I see this movie from the perspective of Natasha. She's a great Russian spy. She's hardly trust people. She manipulated people easily and this sort of character is well portrayed in this movie. Her child background is fantastic. It describes why a person becomes very careful in trusting people. She barely knew her mum and she learns how to fake herself when she's still a child. I think it's very touching that she actually found someone to hold onto which is her fake sister, which also comes from the same background as her. That's how she develops this human traits that we all have which we called sympathy. The story kind of make me feel like it's very deep and emotional. It makes me feel like Natasha is the real heroes of all. I think the cinematography is well depicted for a person who's not an expert but somehow, it's really entertain my lockdown mood. I love the movie."
2472,7,"Plenty to like in Natasha Romanoff's solo adventure! [+69%] Natasha Romanoff gets a befitting origin story and an extremely gratifying arc in her MCU sendoff film. I loved all the lead characters in this - Florence Pugh (as Yelena) is amazing as always; David Harbour (as Alexei) provides great comic relief; Rachel Weisz (as Melina) continues kicking arse as she did a couple of decades ago. Scarlett Johansson leads the pack here, in a stellar show that leads us to believe how she sacrificed herself in Endgame. The screenplay (by Eric Pearson) is packed with the right doses of situational humour, expensive set-pieces, and a worthwhile plot. On one hand, it feels as if it shouldn't have taken so many years for Natasha's standalone adventure, after watching the film. On the other, it also feels like it came out in the right decade when feminist movements are globally peaking.Especially in Pugh and Harbour, director Cate Shortland finds characters worth investing time, energy, and screenspace in. Sisterhood is used as a powerful storytelling device here - it helps establish the emotions and even a few running gags. The scene where Yelena mocks Natasha's signature poses was a scream. The same goes for the scene where Alexei tries to make Yelena feel better after an uncomfortable revelation during their family reunion. The good thing is that Cate Shortland's vision fits like a glove within the MCU, even when it is devoid of Avenger cameos or Easter eggs. She devotes sufficient time to the expository scenes between set pieces, gradually building effective connections between the film's protagonists.What I found unnecessary is Shortland's hand-holding of the audience when it comes to the twists. And just like Mandarin in Iron Man 3, TaskMaster (Olga Kurylenko) feels very underutilized as an antagonist. The CGI, for a $200 mn budget, looks stunning for the most part, except in a few shots where it looks tacky. Even with said issues, Black Widow ends on an action-packed, emotional high. As a star, Johansson clearly knows when to play lead and when to let others around her shine and have their moments. I look forward to seeing Pugh become a key figure in the next phase of the MCU. She's just that damn good and deserves a solo film of her own in the near future!"
2473,1,"Waste of time What a waste , huge one 😒...I waited for disappointed...villan like a useless ..."
2474,10,EXCELLENT Very well done. Plenty of action with great story line. Those giving poor ratings forget that movies are fun and this had plenty of fun.
2475,8,A decent closure to the black widow character The movie was good. It completely do justice to the BW character but it could have been better if the character were made to struggle a more for their goals in the film.At some points movie lack its marvel point of view.Although we waited for so much time for this movie but it some how make me think it could have been better with story. Overall it was a decent watch .Not too good not bad at all but just what has to be done.
2476,4,Another Marvel movie that treats viewers like idiots!! Too many one liners. Too much incoherent dialogue. WAY too much pointless action!! Why did they even make this movie??
2477,4,"If Russia made marvel movies This isn't a regular marvel film. The characters are wooden, the pacing slow, the story pointless.It has excellent action and fight sequences however without a good story it's mediocre.The villain is also terrible. Overall a poor marvel film."
2478,6,"Nothing interesting here I didn't remember a thing about the MCU background history and still I don't. You can watch this movie more or less as a stand-alone fortunately.In short, Black Widow is hunted by the SHIELD for some kinda reason and she can't have no support from them, that's cool. Then she has to go back home to fix something she thought was ok, but in reality it's not, ok cool. She fixes it and saves the day.I watched it expecting a superhero movie without any moral or philosophical intent and that was the whole point of this movie. It's pure entertainment with lots of action, some puns, good music and easter eggs. Exactly like Iron-Man 2. I don't remember the plot of Iron-Man 2. The same will happen to Black Widow.In brief, it's the classical MCU movie with the Iron-Man format without nothing outstanding that will be forgotten in about 3 weeks."
2479,10,"Scarlett Johansson is sensational If the universe give you a chance to be a superhero, be Black Widow instead of Wonder Woman! A must watch family focused super action movie.."
2480,10,Best movie of 2021 This has been the best movie so far in 2021 I have enjoyed every second of it 😍😂😍😂😐😂😍🙅 just wow.
2481,7,"Too Typical A great first act centred on an interesting origin story, but things get bland and so typical for Marvel afterwards."
2482,9,Three great actresses! This movie is slow to start but is great once it gets going. Maybe some of the most complex storytelling of any MCU movie.
2483,10,"PHENOMENAL Black Widow is a blast!! Well worth the wait for this character to have her very own movie. I do wish it came after Captain America: Civil War in 2017, but that's fine. A lot of action, drama, and just a pinch of comedy in there, and this made me feel a tad bit more connected to Natasha Romanoff. If you haven't seen this film, watch it! It's well deserved."
2484,1,"Are we done yet? Characters are different but the story the same.Originality please.Are we really this dumb/bored. No more Marvel, no more Star Wars etc etcSteven Dorff is spot on. Come on people!!!!!Love Scarlet though. One star for her."
2485,8,"Average MCU First 20 minutes are stellar! The opening credits are breath-taking! However, after the first third of the film a steady decline happens.Stakes are not felt, action is mid, third act is not memorable CGI mess.Should have come out right after Civil war!"
2486,5,How did they manage to make Florence Pugh act like Gal Gadot? LOL The CGI is hilarious but these are two Oscar nominees lmao. How do they get those terrible line readings out of Oscar contenders?The third act its an absolute joke for me i'm sorry.
2487,3,"Badly edited and boring Title pretty much sums it up.There were so many opportunities to have great action scenes and fight choreography, but it never happened.The editing was just truly terrible. The way some scenes cut to different camera angles was down right jarring.Special effects were great one moment, then terrible the next.Also, the music choice in certain places was really poor and didn't fit at all.Really disappointing, as it was a character they could have done so well with.Florence Pugh was the only good thing in the film."
2488,9,"Really good, wish it came before Endgame trainwreck I really enjoyed this. More than expected. Thought it would be boring since Nat is already gone but this was amazing. I really liked Nat and Yelena's dynamic. And the whole family's dynamic together too. The Taskmaster touch was really nice.Loved everyone's costumes and the shades thrown at the first Avengers movie (lol) Also, the fight scenes reminiscent of the (redacted) were chef's kiss. The post cedits scene had me screaming so can't wait for whatever is next in the story. Yelena, my beloved!"
2489,5,Just OK The movie was just ok. I'm happy I saw it but falls in the category of a movie I wouldn't volunteer to watch again. One thing that definitely dropped the ball with this movie is Taskmaster. They wasted such a great comic character.
2490,3,"Too Disneyized, Natasha needs more screentime, Basically an ad for DisneyPlus Well, I'm a huge MCU fan and deliberately avoided any spoilers for this before I saw this. I was expecting this to be a swan song for Natasha Romanoff, and the Avengers-centric era of MCU. Finally, I thought to myself, THE Black Widow, the only female Avenger, the world's most deadly assassin (well maybe next to Winter Soldier) and dangerous spy is finally getting her OWN film. We finally get to explore her backstory and see her kick ass as the main character.Unfortunately, what I saw wasn't a Black Widow film, it was, I don't know how to descibe it, but think of a children's action-comedy focusing on a nuclear family, like the Incredibles, but with Natasha Romanoff set as the ""big sister"".The film focuses way too heavily on Yelena (the kid sister played by Pugh) and Romanoff's ""Family"", which is introduced for the first time in the MCU. You have the goofy strong man dad who's a washed up loser but has a good heart, the smart scientist mom, and the smart-alecky kid sister, The ""sister jokes"" between Pugh and Johansson fall completely flat. Hahaha, forced hysterectomy on young girls, hilarious...""Red Defender"" played by David Harbour was kinda funny, but completely out of place. So now the Soviets made another Super Soldier besides the Winter Soldier and the failed experiments in Siberia? They had their own version of Captain America and yet this is the first time we're hearing of it. Is he lying about knowing Captain America, or was his aging slowed like Bucky? We'll never know, but then again, I came too see a movie about the Black Widow, not the dollar store Russian knock-off Avengers.The Red Room, where other Black Widows are trained, along with the Taskmaster and the villain who created them, could've been so much more interesting, but they're just plot devices used to show us more of the MCU bad fake-Russian accent, action Hero Simpsons episode.I was hoping to see Black Widow, the elite lone assassin, with a story reminiscient of La Femme Nikita. Instead I got this goofy family comedy from Disney. If you stay for the post-credit scene, you'll realize this whole thing is a setup for the upcoming Hawkeye series on Disney Plus.In other words, the reason Pugh gets so much screen time, and the ""kid sister"" gets so much dialogue, is because this whole movie was an advertisement for another show.ScarJo and Natasaha Romanoff deserved better."
2491,5,"Not great but it's ok The story was great I liked it but they couldn't put the things together well. It's funny and action packed. But Apparently it did not live upto the expectations as we all know.The direction and cinematography was bad in my opinion....... Did not expect this from marvel but because of the story its just okay and ""watchable"".COULD HAVE DONE BETTER."
2492,8,Good movie The movie in general was good. Typical Marvel movie. Ray winstone however shouldn't have been given the part. His cockney accent shines through and his acting i bad as usual. So many good actors to choose from and they choose him 🙄. Apart from that the movie was good.
2493,3,"Russian opinion This movie disappointed me a lot.Maybe it was because of my expectations of him.It's just that the film was supposed to reveal more of Natasha's character.Show her from a new side that we have not seen before And that was nothing You presented the film as filled with ""Russian character"" But even that was not there And the widow's past Showing all the horrors that she had to go through."
2494,5,"Too worried about its audience's perception The movie feels self concious about its character. Trying to prove she's worthy of the title she shares with literal gods, it relies in unrestrained bombastic action, full things blowing up or crashing (using a not so good cgi), while the old good hand to hand combat one would come to expect from this movie is both brief and lacking.In the narrative department the movie gives you scenes full of emotional dialogue (along with jokes and exposition is the only type of dialogue I've found) with no build up to back it up. Why should anyone care about or even believe this ""family"" when they've only seen it for two minutes before cutting to a car chase.These wounds just deepen with a soundtrack who knows nothing of restraint, selling scenes with regular dialogue as pivotal moments or killing the tension in otherwise good action scenes that sound the same at the beginnig, when nothing has happened yet, and the end, when everything's going down.Wrapping up with the negatives, taksmaster is extremely underused (I don't really mind changes from it's comicbook counterpart), and the movie would benefit greatly from cutting the Morocco scene entirely (too many reasons to comment here). And don't get me started on the comments, jokes and references aimed specifically for the audience, for you to feel good because ""you got it"", taking you out of the story.To end in a positive note; Johansson, Harbour and Pugh give tremendous charisma to their characters. Red guardian's character is BRILLIANTLY constructed through subtle action and not exposition, even if he migth be too much of a comic relief for some. The movie has some really good moments."
2495,2,MONEY WAST I watch the black widow .oo marvel and mcu. Is Sick and treatment definitely.
2496,9,The sisters! Just saw it and honestly I cried.. a lot..... NATASHA ROMANOFF DESERVED BETTER!!! Thank you Scarlett Johansson for 11 years as the BW proving that women can do anything no matter the universe! I'm going to miss her in the MCU. Also the sister relationship between Nat and Yelena is setting a whole new level for MCU 4 when Florence Pugh returns.
2497,1,"Disappointed The scale and the characters are way lower then ""Infinite stone"" series standard. Black widow as one of the most important character in Avengers deserves way better story. I honestly can't believe MARVEL made this movie so unthoughtful, the only purpose of this movie is generate more money from MARVEL fans."
2498,1,Boring Most uneventful movie I've watched I wouldn't waist my time watching a movie like this.
2499,8,"Good, but not great I'd really been looking forward to this, so even though I enjoyed it, I also found it a bit of a letdown. Taskmaster was a pointless and unneeded addition to the film, serving very little purpose. And the script felt a bit ropey and unnatural at times. But other than it was pretty good, and Florence Pugh was amazing! She stole every scene she appeared in. I hope she gets her own MCU movies, I'd defo watch more of her."
2500,5,"The Russian Accents Are Coming! The Russian Accents Are Going! I love Scarlett Johansson and I like her as the MCU Black Widow, although her character was never really the comic book Black Widow, and she never really felt like a hardened Russian spy who could switch sides at any moment. For most of the MCU movies, except for an awkward and ill-conceived flirtation with Bruce Banner, she's been scene candy and a one-liner machine. (Her best moments were in WINTER SOLDIER.) Now she finally gets her own movie, a chance to fill in and fill out the details that have been teased at. But what we get is a rushed, poorly directed, poorly written afterthought.It starts with a decent, but rushed opening a la THE AMERICANS. But if only there were one more scene with the girls interacting, one more scene with Red Guardian being a goofy dad, and all of them having fun, but it's over too quickly. (Also, were young teens really dying their hair blue in the '90s?)Then, during the opening credits, we get a mishmash of quick cuts -- when we should have seen how cruel the Red Room was. So there's no real depth to the pain they talk about. It's all told not shown.Then the plot starts, Natasha is called to action by her ""sister."" Johansson seems a little tired of the role now, and Florence Pugh brings some energy and handles the quippy MCU banter well. Although her size makes her fight scenes hard to believe. Also, in scene after scene, these two get in car crashes, fall off buildings, get thrown around, and receive what should be lethal injuries -- and they just walk away! The movie tries to nod to this by showing Natasha with bruises and needing Advil -- but it's a copout. The most interesting thing about BW is that she's human, highly trained, but human. So she should fight with her training and her wits -- because she needs to avoid serious injury. She should be having more Bourne-like action scenes, not being tossed around like Thor.For the rest: some forced family drama (which, again, could have used one or two more beats), and Taskmaster is change from an annoying comic character into a twist we've seen a thousand times before. (It brackets the narrative, which is something screenwriters are taught to do, but it was unexciting and sloppily handled). Ray Winstone is given nothing to do, the camera barely pays attention to him so he's given no weight as a villain, and his Russian accent is awful and comes and goes badly.I would have killed for a Dottie Underwood cameo!At least this wasn't as bad as RED SPARROW."
2501,4,"Boring predictable I had a hard time staying awake last 30 mins of the movie. Really lazy writing and not so impressive CGI effects. And tired of the cliche Russian villain with cruel Russian agents, we get it in MCU, Americans are the only good people.And the plot has guy with the technology to control minds yet you don't see one scene where he has actually used that for any significant effect."
2502,5,"Waste of time actually and very dissapointed Not a very good story, and just a bad plot. Same old Marvel story. Stop the badguy and dont let them control ""super soldiers"""
2503,10,"Been a long time coming Really loved it shame it took so long, should have had her own movie a lot sooner."
2504,8,"Pugh for the win! I love Scarlet.I think she's a tremendously talented actress and I've been a major fan since Lost in translation, where she completely stole the scene.I liked this movie and in my opinion it's one of the better MCU movies. (much much better than both Black Panther and Wonder Woman '84 ) Yes it could have been darker and more serious, ala ""Anna"" (2019), ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017) or obviously the awesome ""Red Sparrow"" (2018). Of course there were things here and there that annoyed me a little, but never something that bothered me throughout the movie. More like for a moment here and there...after all this is a Marvel superhero movie, so it wouldn't be fair to expect it to be things like scary, realistic or educational, for example ;) I really loved the fighting sequences! Yes they were exaggerated a.f. But again...this is a superhero movie.It's 100% pure entertainment!However, what impressed me the most was Florence Pugh! While David Harbour and Scarlett Johansson were great in their roles, the only reason why the're not sharing the spotlight here is BECAUSE they are great actors (an extra ""great"" for David who's in my opinion a somewhat underestimated actor) and so, anything BUT great would have been a disappointment coming from those two. Sorry David and Scarlett, but with greatness comes responsibilities :) No, the star that shone the brightest in this film was an unexpected one! It was the star of Florence Pugh and it shone throughout the whole film, and the fact that her voice ""matched the accent"" (i know this sounds weird) was just icing on the cake for me.I think i'm smitten :)"
2505,3,"Black widow gets less screen time in her own movie This movie isn't even really about her, focuses on her family more. She has more action scenes in the avengers movies then her own movie. It was a good watch, but I expected better. Especially after pushing it off so long."
2506,1,"Black Soul Movie has no soul. It's overdone, yet underwhelming. Why push these roles to this extent, they are entertaining enough as they are... WHY PUSH IT? It's ruining it for all, oh man :("
2507,7,"The problem with prequels. So I was a little unimpressed with this film. When approaching a character with no super powers but still aiming to make a large action film you have to aim high but fall short.Black Widow is set between Civil War and Infinity War and does a great job of setting itself in between those events but it does feel like a filler film and not Natasha's Swan Song. If this had been released chronologically it would have fared far better going on Romanov's journey without knowing where it ends. I personally would have preferred her solo outing to show us what really happened in Budapest rather than just more alluring comments to her defection. Had this film been the origin of Barton and Natasha's relationship then that would have given more heft to her death in Endgame other than introducing the family that are never seen or heard from again.Where I would have hoped for James Bond meets Black Widow, this film felt like Mission Impossible meets MCU - the exaggerated action and set pieces of international espionage are fun but the plot isn't the most adventurous. Action scenes are thick and fast and well choreographed and the majority of the main cast pull off great performances.The Taskmaster twist I saw coming a third of the way through the movie and felt he was a character that was greatly let down - the comics version can go toe-to-toe with Captain America but only a couple of decent sequences let this shell of a character see any screen time. Red Guardian also suffered from under use - the soviet super soldier has no explanation of how he came to be or what his past really entails other than boastful stories of a washed up hero.Black Widow's delay has not helped. The Disney+ trio of WandaVision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki have done some amazing work moving the MCU and it's characters forward that to then drop a prequel and move backwards always comes with risks of telling a chapter that has to fit into the established canon and not create its own."
2508,8,"Great movie Yeah, the movie was great . A little one or two things were off though... like cgi effects in last fight is poor and the introduction of taskmaster... I mean... Taskmaster is too strong to deal with for Natasha... Captain America should have been the one to deal with this character. They should have introduced in captain America movies. Audiences would love the fight between Cap and taskmaster.Marvel should be more concerned about introduction of characters."
2509,10,"I definitely saw a different movie then everyone else in here! Seriously stop moaning.... The movie it's great, the action is great, the story it's Good, acting is great, could have use more depth on the Villains, there's still a blank between young Natasha and Avenger Natasha. As a spy character, could have be abit more in that direction.. regardless I was intertwined fo the entire duration. 10/10."
2510,10,"A Breakthrough for Hollywood and Marvel Black Widow is here and it has far exceeded expectations! Scarlett Johansson is finally enabled to astonish and entertain her audience with sheer skill, ability, and heart! This is such a refreshing but on-your-feet film that FINALLY does not capitalize on exploiting sexuality or sex appeal! I'm talking, a family friendly, Jason Bourne equivalent in Black Widow. But don't let ""Family friendly"" sound cliche here. The cast cohesion was breathtaking and natural. Florence Pugh met, matched, and completed Johansson's character as well, with the entire cast giving the audience such amazing charisma, strength, and grit. Incredible choices that fully brought the film to life. There was much wonder about how Black Widow would be brought to the screen with such a dark backstory, but Director Cate Shortland and her team, brought more than the story. It is incredible how, with this film, major milestones are met in trafficking awareness, women's equality, and human kindness. Not falling short with action and cinematography, Black Widow is raw, thrilling, and inspiring, that regardless the path, regardless the person, there is always a way forward.A must-see, watch again and again, amazing action film. This movie was meant to be, and meant to be now. Absolutely loyal to the Marvel name and reputation, while providing everything that could be hoped for, and not lacking in anything. Black Widow is legendary."
2511,3,"Peak soulless - Introduce new location, banter, boring action scene, repeat. Marvel is reaching peak soulless. They have finely tuned industrial movie production where movies are produced using checklists and must have scenes.The movie is just think plot to tie in sequence of introduce new location, banter, action scenes.Action scenes are boring and don't advance the plot. Banter is forced. New locations are just new locations."
2512,3,"Boring, uninspired I dont expect much from Marvel movies, I just want to be entertained. I am OK with plots that start to unravel if you think about them a little bit and with stories that are easily predictable. But this one is just boring and uninspired and feels like all of it has been done before. By the way, I dont understand the praise for Pugh. All the actors were fine, no problems there, but she didnt stand out. And she doesnt really have a superhero physique."
2513,4,"Just unnecessary, and not that good. This is the MCU's 'Solo - A Star Wars Story', a film that didn't need to be made as it beings nothing to the franchise, not many people wanted and is just very poor fan service.Taskmaster as a villain is wasted (and pathetic), the writing of the characters is very shallow, especially Natasha Romanov who seems to have had her claws removed. And the humour is forced and misplaced.This is almost like a second rate James Bond knock off, definitely not what we expect from Marvel and a rare mis-step from Kevin Feige."
2514,3,Taskmistress ruins it for everyone Why does Kevin Fiege and team need to tweak a character that's already great and one of fan favourite. Making the character a girl and that too with forced sad storyline was such a miss. They should have kept his identity a secret. Maybe a bounty hunter type of guy that emerges from shadow and then wraps himself back into one would have ben perfect and would have allowed him to tangle with other MCU heroes somewhere in future. But they made character into a bionic android and flushed it all by the end.Story was generic and even CGI was meh at many times especially during the final fight. The family element could have been better executed with less dialogue and more emphasis via actions like Red Guardian saving Yelena or Natasha.Also the main villain guy was poorly written with generic goal of world domination. Marvel needs to up his game in terms of villains and his motivations.
2515,2,Finally a bad movie from marvel's Never Expected marvel's to do this bad. This movie is totally unnecessary and have no link with other movies.
2516,3,"Underwhelming to say the least This could have been great if Marvel had stick to the recipe of the first minutes of the film. But the whole thing derails in such a way that that all I can say is to save your money.The acting is good, but the jokes couldn't have been more misplaced, the action scenes are either so so or something that would be over the top even for a full suited Tony Stark. The villain is terrible and the whole story surrounding him is beyond bad, makes little sense and barely fits in the MCU.The whole timeline doesn't really work and even the post-credits scenes is bad given the context that the characters that show up in there were previously inserted.Bottom line is, this is the worst MCU movie by far and did a disservice for a beloved character. Save your money or go watch it with zero expectations."
2517,6,"Disaster This is okay movie ok action ok story but taskmaster ruined, 😐 taskmaster characters is disaster. I mean he is worst villains in marvel."
2518,6,"sub par marvel movie and wasted talent First off the taskmaster worst ever marvel adaption i remember him from the comic books being such a great villain. Its insane how he was reduced to nothing in this movie.Feminist and LGBT are gaining in every movie yet they fail to see that an all star cast women fails every time.Its an ok movie but nothing more, and a disappointment in the end."
2519,9,Thumbs up Nice job. Avengers never disappoint me. Well we should not expect something like infinity and endgame but movie itself is pretty cool. Good job Scarlet you're an amazing star.👍🏻👍🏻
2520,8,"Really enjoyed it, a perfectly appropriate tone for a black widow movie. A solid movie with good performances. David harbour's Russian accent was bordering on cheesy at some points, as were the family references, but overall I enjoyed it greatly."
2521,8,"Epic film, as always Black Widow once again is an excellent addition to the MCU. It is great to finally see a stand-alone film for a character that has been on the sidelines since the beginning. The action sequences are great and there are many touching moments through the story. Not to mention an incredible opening credits scene.It is great to finally see what Natasha Romanov was up to in the years she was on the run. Her rekindled relationship with her family and her drive to take down a former enemy makes for a great plot involving action, intrigue, and excitement. The new heroes added to the MCU with this movie make me excited to see what Marvel can put out in the future. Florence Pugh's character was especially entertaining to watch in action.One very major critique of Black Widow is the movie's handling of Taskmaster. To put it frankly, she shouldn't have been Drakov's daughter. Taskmaster is an incredible villain that deserves a better backstory and motivation than mind control.This complaint can easily be forgotten when you think about the post credit scene. Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is back, and she has a new recruit. It is clear that she is forming a new squad of heroes (if you want to call them that) and it is so exciting to see what she will get up to in the next couple years.All in all, Black Widow is a great, yet not incredible superhero film. It makes for a great movie to watch in theaters for the first time in a long while, especially if you are a Marvel fan."
2522,8,Marvel party is back since the pandemic began 2020 no Marvel at all dam sucks man. Not just with MCU fanatics but the entire theatrical industry all together. Dam glad the old normal is back in summer 2021 although safety prevention still needs practise while masks on. What a way 2 restart the phase 4 movie run. Series like wanda falcon and loki is just an appetizer. Black Widow is a main course and a huge one. Great story. Great full scale action. We shall see TaskMaster again some time. Also got the feeling Yelova will be the new Black Widow once she settles the score with Hawkeye. Overall worth watching it in the theater nearby.
2523,10,Best marvel movie yet I loved this movie Scarletts and Florences preformances were amazing I loved every second of the movie and i'm seeing it in the cinema fir the second time tomorrow and watched it 6 times since it came out on disney+
2524,1,"Worst superhero movie This movie was boring I struggled to watch it.The characters weren't believable.The story line was going no where, the fight scenes were so over done.And in the end it was just a movie pushing some woke feminist narrative.There was a lot of toxic femininity in this movie."
2525,4,"Unispiring bad writing So many problems with the story, unsinspiring characters, weakest villain, the only 2 men in the film showed as useless, even women characters were just boring to watch for me.The effects and acting was okay, but this movie was so badly written. Very disappointed, but not as bad as Captain Marvel or Ant Man I guess."
2526,1,Boaring...Need stong villen Marvel makes their heroes are great but they don't look at villen... Villen is main part of movie. Overacting and Boaring movie....worst.
2527,7,Time pass Concentrates more on developing the characters for future rather than concentrating on black widow.
2528,7,Florence Pughes UPSTAGES Scarlet Johansen This film definitely has its flaws - like Florence Pughes TERRIBLE RUSSIAN ACCENT.But she undeniably steals the spotlight from Scarlet with absolutely zero effort.I actually cannot believe how bad an actress Scarlett is when out next to Florence. It's so surprising.Film is okay. Watch if you're bored.
2529,5,"I'd rate wonder woman 1986 better than this! Atleast it was trying for audience to like it. Looks like Marvel just wanted a movie for black widow and didn't want it to be super cool. It feels like they didn't even try. They just made it a generic spy flick. Wonder woman 1986 had a lot of flaws but they tried, they had new ideas, their humor was better. Russian accents cannot carry the whole movie. Funny fat dad cannot make a weak plot line strong. There was no sense of a proper villain. The movie was all over the place."
2530,10,"MARVELS RETURN TO THE CINEMA This film is amazing! Theres ppl who gave low ratings, but if you watched previous marvel films its really easy to follow, and its realllyy funny, i didnt give it a 10 but i cant tell you why (its a spoiler) but this film is AMAZING!!"
2531,2,Not worth seeing The first half hour was ok. The rest kinda awful. Not worth seeing.
2532,5,"Feige: Don't repeat this with any dead characters, ever again. The good: Considering that the main character doesn't have superpowers, there is no option but to focus on good action sequences, chases, and spectacular rescues in the purest 90s action movie style. This works if you are looking for a film to leave in the background while you're cooking some delicious bolognese pasta. Entertaining if you don't pay too much attention to the plot and if you manage to avoid sentimentality.The bad: Marvel Studios wanted to go out and brag about their Ferrari, but they didn't realize that the gasoline tank was almost empty. This story is really like the Ferrari. It looks pretty on the outside, following the tone of the entire MCU, but it doesn't work, because the spark to turn it on isn't useful enough.If we look at it from the perspective of the entire saga, it doesn't contribute anything that could not have been justified in a brief scene from another future canon film. The main character's arc is unaffected at all, it doesn't sort out loose ends from chronologically subsequent movies (if there are any), and it doesn't focus on Nat's real origin, other than a couple of conversations. They could have included tons of different cameos, or introduced iconic characters for the rest of the series, but sadly none of that is here (and don't make up tales saying that Valentina Allegra de Fontaine will be iconic).If we see it from the particular perspective, as an isolated product, it does not work either. If it were just another Bourne-style spy action movie, it would have been a total flop. And the villains? They are not convincing at all. Taskmaster, having enormous potential, is a real waste of character here.This movie is skippable, even more than the first 2 TV series of the MCU."
2533,9,Moulded Perfectly Movie Black Widow is Beautifully Moulded. Every character is so strong. Specially Scarlet Johanson and Florence Pugh stole the show completely. ❤💖
2534,9,"I'm a Natasha and MCU lover, that's why Okay, so I watched after I waited for 2 YEARS and it's clearly better than I expected. I rated it 9 because like I said in the title, I'm an Natasha and MCU lover.BUT, some things disappointed me too. Like Taskmaster, who was revealed to be Dreykov's daughter. Well, that's a good plot twist but because of that, we know that she won't come back in the upcoming movies and that's why I want because she seemed so cool on the trailers and her fights scenes are incredible. That would be a waste to not see her anymore.Also, I don't know why but I feel like they could've done more with Alexei/Red Guardian. Because, despite his funny scenes, he doesn't appear that much.The final battle is explosive and all but there is not really a fight, like the Red Room explodes, Natasha saves Yelena in the air after she killed Dreykov. Okay. But, where is the big fight. There's more fight on the previous scene that the final battle, like in Homecoming. I wanted to see Natasha, Yelena, Alexei and Melina to show their amazing fights skills.But anyway, it's still an amazing movie and I can't wait to see Yelena in Hawkeye."
2535,2,Marvel has never gone so low Underwhelming storyline and worst CGI they've ever had. Not sure how the director approved this but it's telling.
2536,9,"Truly enjoyable I laughed so hard I cried at the family dynamic, and I felt it was overall a great movie. Paid the $30 on Disney plus and will watch multiple times. I had to google top hand to hand fighters in the marvel universe and Black Widow and Taskmaster usually show up in the top 10. So a new found respect for the Black Widow abilities. In a world of fictional characters, how could you not love this movie. And how is Colin Jost not the happiest man in the world next to me?"
2537,5,"I'm very disappointed. First of all, I've waited long time for this movie. Thought it was gonna be a cool movie but all I get is disappointment. Story is trash. And don't talk about directing. I think director of this movie's got not enough experience. And Worst writer in Marvel Comic.Sorry I can't write no more reviews on this."
2538,9,"As a spy action movie, it had everything you need! Look. While I respect them massively, I don't read comics, I never have, and I think it's okay for movies to take creative licence when basing a story on comics. People get so angry over things that movies change! It is a movie! Not a comic. I liked Taskmaster in general! I wish they won more fights, but apart from they they seemed pretty badass.Anyway to the plot. I enjoyed it. The twists are nice and unexpected throughout, the acting is great, the fight scenes are creative for the MCU, and the CGI is outstanding as always. I really enjoyed this movie, more than a lot of other Marvel Movies, like Thor 1 and 2, Iron man 2, Captain America, etc etc.So many people base their reviews off of the comics. JUST ENJOY THE MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS, A MOVIE!I think it's great."
2539,7,"good but not enough Black widow was my favorite character in MCU. After years of waiting we finally get the solo movie and it was good but not enough. Now we have to say goodbye to Natasha with this movie?! We want more explanations from her life and her journey with Hack eye and nick fury, how she got in shield and become an avenger, and her life before shield and her adventure in red room. We deserve more, this character has more potential. Marvel is introducing new characters without give us enough explanation about the old ones. Frankly this movie only show us how Nat's hair got blond in infinity war!We need more."
2540,2,"Useless attempt Seeing black widow in avengers, fighting aliens and superhumans never made sense to me since she is a glorified spy, like james bond but with better martial arts skills. But when marvel announced this movie, I was curious to see black widow in her own domain, but In the movie she could be thor himself. I mean she falls off from 4th floor hitting evry pipe and vent on the way down very brutally and still manages to land on her feet. I mean whaaaaaaaat? Really? And that's not just one scene, she is indestructible in literally all the fighting scenes to the point it doesn't even make sense for her to be qualified as human.Anyways, moving on to the villain, what a pathetic... And i mean really pathetic portrayal of the main villain. This man supposedly controlling the entire world is just an old man with temper issues? Really? Where is the intimidation? My grandmother was more brutal than this so called ""villain"".And don't even get me started on Taskmaster. ANOTHER GENDER SWAP, Marvel and Disney are hell bent on ruining the existing characters. How difficult is it to use existing female characters or even create new ones? But nooooo ooooooo.... Female empowerment cannot be done without snatching something from males. They could have just left the identity hidden and used taskmaster in other marvel movies as well. Pathetic.Action itself was supposed to be subtle, but they made it downright an avenger movie. CGI was okayish, action sequences were overdone.Only good parts of the movie for me were the ones with David harbour. He wasn't super funny but he tried."
2541,8,What a comeback for Marvel to the cinemas What a grounded approach to a superhero movie after so much of alien invasions! Everytime studios take a grounded approach the audience can relate to it more just like winter soldier or the iron man movies. It had excellent action sequences with a good enough storyline.
2542,1,Poor movie Worst movie of marvel Poor vfx .everything look fake from beginning.
2543,3,"The worst version of Black Widow in a disappointing package I had pretty high expectations for this film going into it. I thought for sure that marvel was trying to make a powerful move out of the gate after endgame. Spider-Man Far from home was as refreshing and fun as Homecoming. I started to see that marvel had hit a quality stride I could count on. In comparison, this Black Widow movie was hard to watch, and frankly, they shouldn't have even made it. I really liked Black Widow throughout the MCU, and Wintersoldier was probably the best film featuring her, but this feels like it's trying very hard to make a social point rather than tell a truly compelling story featuring larger than life super soldiers. My absolute favourite part was David Harbour. His role is relatively small but it was fascinating. I think it was a huge misopportunity to give him a bigger role, so he could really show off his strengths.One glaring problem of this movie was humour. Almost all of its humour was misplaced and eye rolling.I wonder if the story might actually be good, but needed to be told by a director who knew how it should be told.If you're an MCU fan, don't watch this movie. If you like good movies, don't watch this movie."
2544,10,"Exactly what you expect it to be. Solid movie.CG was a little drab in places, but it's pretty great."
2545,8,"Black widow is a fast paced, super fun movie Coming up to the release of black widow, I was rather unexcited, the trailers made the movie look a bit boring just your average talk-fight-talk-fight movie. Boy was I wrong! Black widow is so exciting,exilerating, funny and really interesting!Scarlett Johanssan (probably spelled wrong) is great as is David Harbour, Rachel Weisz and especially Florence Pugh.Black widow ranks high on my list of favourite marvel movies and is definently one of the most memorable!Black widow is just so much fun."
2546,7,"Better than Captain Marvel But that's really not an accomplishment. It's a scale which a movie has to or needs to pass, I believe.If this movie came out around 2017, well, then it'd have been a whole different story.Better late than never, huh?"
2547,6,"Dissapointing I had huge expectations on this movie,but I'm not satisfied after watching it. The first half was decent but then it gets worse every minute. I don't even understand why there was a villian in this movie as he had no screen presence at all. It just seemed that they gave priority to solving Natasha's family issues rather than solving the real issues."
2548,5,"Not here nor there I'm not quite sure what they were trying to accomplish here... The movie started as a classic Advengers Marvel action movie, then it wanted to move to the funny side as a Thor movie to end up as the typical villain movie where the bad guy explains his plan so our hero can ruin world domination.I do not know where they are trying to go with this, they spent the correct amount of money to create an action flick that will entertain you but at no point this is a good movie or something that you should recommend someone to see...My opinion in few words... if you have nothing better to do, watch it while doing something else.PS.. loved the Mission Impossible mask thin solution... it os ridiculous when they do it... it is offensive when you see it somewhere else."
2549,6,"A Big Dissapointment for a Marvel Movie From a mediocre storyline, bad CGI, to unwanted banters and meh script. People waited so long for this movie and they butchered it! This sht is not what Ive expected from a marvel movie. Such a shame."
2550,3,Boring generic and Rip taskmaster. I mean I didn't expect much from a movie that came out a decade late but black widow still managed to disappoint me. The story was basic and black widow was inhuman. They also managed to destroy a great character like taskmaster. The only good part was yelena.Don't watch this trainwreck.
2551,6,"After thought Marvel makes good movies. The 2hrs definitely flew by but wasn't the backstory I wanted. Marvel does great at fitting all these ""spinoffs"" into the timeline but would've been great to have had this released in the order of its timeline. But then again it's a stand alone and the ""cliffhanger"" is a movie we watched years ago."
2552,5,TaskMaster disappointed + no movie story TaskMastér identity didn't surprised. TaskMastér character was not in action And we have already seen movie + all action in trailer So there was nothing new.
2553,9,a good movie People just complaining for stupid things story is pretty good and character development is awesome presented superbly im not disappointed pretty good movie.
2554,6,"Expected a Logan like Send-Off & got Iron Man 2 !! There are Marvel movies which are great, and then there are Marvel movies which are just average cash-grabs. Sadly Black Widow falls into the latter category but as one of the Founding Members of Avengers, she deserved a much better Send Off. The film's promising opening scene indicates this would be a very personal & emotional experience but it never becomes that mostly due to Marvel's obnoxious tendency to force stupid jokes into every scene. Scar Jo does okay for her role but I expected to see a new dimension in her character and it never happened & she often got overshadowed by Florence Pugh's Eleyna who was just amazing & I am looking forward to her future in MCU. David Harbor's character is just a bumbling idiot & Rachel Weisz offers nothing. The Villains are once again very boring. Some of the Action sequences are good. The story had raw potential but it got marred by average screenplay & dialogue. Won't be keeping this one in my MCU collection."
2555,6,Feels like an anime filler episode This movie offers simply nothing but as a marvel fan we're gonna watch it anyway because we love Black Widow. Just like an anime filler episode it offers nothing. You watch it cz you love the anime and you've nothing better to do.
2556,7,"Far from top tier MCU but still engaging... Black Widow is an adequate return to the movies for Marvel. It's perhaps one of the more serious and dialogue-heavy entries of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz bear a convincing enough dynamic and carry a straightforward spy narrative with decent emotional depth. Per the Marvel norm, the action delivers plentiful fast-paced thrills and the film isn't short of comedic relief, often poking fun at old Marvel character tropes and allowing David Harbor to get absolutely lost in his role; he's rather delightful and I hope to see more of him in later media.The villains are pretty forgettable, though, and I felt the relationship between the four main characters was a tad lacking. The first 15 minutes set an interesting and almost artful standard that hooked me immediately but it pretty much goes the formulaic comic book movie route after that point and it's...good; I got to fully understand Natasha and receive some closure on her story, though I can't help but note the missed opportunities. I think more flashbacks like the prologue would've helped cement an even stronger chemistry amongst the leads. We mostly just get a general idea of how they're associated and then it's your typical Marvel fare but it's the performances overall that kept me invested. Black Widow may be far from top tier MCU but it's a solid showcase that great acting can exist in superhero media, which is a notion that has long been doubted and dismissed."
2557,8,"Establishes some previously desired backstory for the original female Avenger while setting things in motion for the future of the MCU ""Black Widow"" is a superhero film serving as the first entry of Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Scarlett Johannson in the lead role, alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz, it establishes some previously desired backstory for the original female Avenger while setting things in motion for the future of the MCU.Sometime after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"", Natasha ""Nat"" Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), still on the run from the US government, is living in a safehouse in Norway. Shortly after receiving a package containing a strange red substance, Nat is attacked by a powerful figure known as the Taskmaster, whom she eventually manages to subdue and make her escape. Nat soon learns that the substance was sent by Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), a fellow assassin raised as her surrogate younger sister, and decides to seek her out for further information. Later in Budapest, Nat and Yelena reunite after decades of estrangement where they discover they are now being pursued by unknown forces that will stop at nothing to wipe them out.It has taken quite a while, eleven years to be precise, for a solo movie to be made about the lone female member of the original six Avengers. In that time, the Black Widow character, or Nat as she's better known, has appeared in many other MCU films, working alongside Steve Rogers/Captain America in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and later going against him by siding with Tony Stark/Iron Man in ""Captain America: Civil War"". After so many films where she is relegated to a supporting role, she finally makes her debut as the main character in ""Black Widow"" and proves she can successfully stand on her own without the help of her fellow heroes.I've always wanted to know more about Nat's character, as she always seemed so shrouded in mystery about her past and why she even decided to join the Avengers in the first place. Aside from a brief hallucination scene in ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"", little else has been divulged about her upbringing. In this film, we not only learn about Nat's home life as a child, but also the reasons why she defected from her Russian roots to become one of Earth's mightiest heroes. We also see how corruption runs deep within the organisations she was loyal to, similar to Hydra's infiltration of S. H. I. E. L. D back in ""The Winter Soldier"". Though the film didn't cover everything I would have liked to see, it does fill in enough blanks to hold me over until a possible sequel or even a future TV series can pick up where it left off.As is often the case with Marvel movies, we are presented with the usual high standard of explosive action sequences and scenes of hand-to-hand combat. However, rather than throw us into the thick of it right away, director Cate Shortland instead uses most of the film's first act to develop Nat as a character, helping us to better understand why it's so important that she gets to the bottom of what is happening all around her. As a result of this, the film does feel a bit slow near the beginning, but it's all worth sitting through for the exciting car chases through Budapest, the shootouts in various different buildings, and a creative helicopter rescue scene that ends on a humorous note. These are later punctuated with meaningful conversations between the characters discussing their insecurities and failures, which helps us to empathise with them. Considering Nat is one of the few Avengers without any proper superpowers or signature weapons, it is necessary for us to be reminded of her vulnerability and that deep down, she is still a regular human being.Scarlett Johansson gives it her all in the role she has gone on record stating is her all-time favourite. She does a great job depicting Nat as a more emotionally motivated character, acting on her own personal instincts rather than as a mindless drone merely doing what she is told. I really liked her interactions with Florence Pugh as Yelena, who is about on the same level as her in terms of combat skills. These two really did feel as though they had a history together and that familial bond they shared made their scenes more believable. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz, although not as prominent in the film as I had hoped, were also a nice addition to the cast as Nat and Yelena's surrogate parents Alexei and Milena. Harbour provides some comic relief reminiscent of his character Hopper in ""Stranger Things"" while Weisz loses herself in the role of both a maternal guardian and an elusive undercover spy.As we see the MCU move beyond the Infinity Saga, it is inevitable there will be even more stories to be told and even more heroes to be introduced. In spite of that, it is comforting to know that one of the most underrated members of the original six was still able to have her much deserved time in the spotlight. With the "" ""Hawkeye"" miniseries not far off, it seems that all of the old Avengers will finally have had an opportunity to shine on their own before the torch is eventually passed on to a brand new team. The seeds for the rest of Phase Four have now been sown and I greatly look forward to what future prospects the MCU has in store for us.I rate it 8/10."
2558,9,Good movie for Marvel fans Lots of action and comedy. Delivered on all expectations.
2559,3,"Stephen Dorff was right this was tragicomical. Third act is disaster, cant believe what I saw, that scene with car and That was fun scene loool, worst scenes in entire MCU history. Bad cgi, soap opera acting, troglodyte villain, idiotic script etc etc. Whole twitter canceled Dorff but he was right about this one:This was garbage.200m budget for this?!? Give me a break LOL."
2560,8,"Black Widow (2021) Opening Night premier in 3D on a 70-foot wall-to-wall screen A film about Natasha Romanoff in her quests between the films Civil War and Infinity War.Natasha Romanoff,( Scarlett Johansson - great as ever) aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger.To be honest I had to keep my expectations in check because I was anticipating this film for so long any film would be hard to live up to my expectations . Gladly , Black Widow for the most part ,was worth the wait :) A fully-fledged female-led adventure ! The film has an excellent cast of Oscar and Emmy nominated talent . Harbour (Stranger Things) and Pugh's (Little Women), delightful turns puncture the film brilliantly. As does ""mother"" Melina Rachel Weisz (The Favourite) .The film has got some incredible set-pieces an excellent cinematography. Including an impressive helicopter sequence that gets your adrenaline pumping and heart racing. The motorcycle chase scene is epic. Some of the fight scene and hand-to-hand combat are truly entertaining ! Black Widow is seriously an action-packed summer blockbuster.Rachel Weisz delivers the most restrained performance in the film as the cold and calculating Melina. She does a great job in a role.David Harbour nails absolutely Alexi aka Red Guardian. Harbour's able to make the character into a goofy, likable dude.Black Widow is Florence Pugh's launching pad into the Marvel world, with her next appearance as Yelena set to be in the Hawkeye series. Johansson passed the baton to Pugh and the Oscar nominee proves she's more than up to the task. Pugh's got the most impressive deadpan delivery and even simple lines of dialogue have depth and bite. There's some really effective sisterly banter between Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh regarding Scarlett Johansson striking a perfect superhero-landing pose as Black Widow. It is quite charming and funny.As good as the ensemble is ; this is Scarlett Johansson's movie and she truly delivers , big time ! Black Widow is not only Scarlett Johansson's final outing in the MCU but also her best of the lot. We find Romanoff in unfamiliar territory, on her own and without any form of a support structure. She's vulnerable in a way that we haven't really seen before, something Johansson portrays beautifully. Scarlett Johansson, the charismatic queen of Marvel science fiction. There's no doubt about it I'm definitely going to miss her Super Hero character.Natasha Romanoff's last hurrah is an action-packed and emotional thrill ride from start to finish. 7.5/10."
2561,8,"Take the family - kids loved it Johansson.as Black Widow, seemed like she was made to play the role but her sister in the film, Pugh, was even better. Loved the banter between the two ""sisters"" and. David Harbour as their dad.""The Red Guardian"" provides some comic relief and depicted the clueless, trying to be cool dad.Did start slower to build the story but the action was pretty solid in the second half and watching it in 4DX was amazing during the tearing down of the Red Room.Took kids aged 9-17 and all of them really liked it giving their ratings from 7 to 10 to can we see it again - like NOW.Take the family and have a good time and try the 4DX - you will not be able to watch an action movie again unless it's in 4DX."
2562,10,"MARVELOUS!!!! This movie was MARVELOUS!!!! Marvel gave us another outstanding movie which my family and I loved!!!! We finally got a movie about one of my favorite Avengers Natasha Romanoff aka the Black Widow. The characters were excellent such a great cast for this film. It was amazing to see Scarlett Johansson reprise her role as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow once again. It was also nice seeing Florence Pugh (Yelena), David Harbour (Alexei) and Rachel Weisz (Melina) play alongside one of our original six Avengers. Definitely worth the money for the premier access. I'll be adding this movie to my favorites list and watching it over and over just like my other favorite marvel films."
2563,10,"BAD The movie is too bad to be a movie.Script is the worst script in entire mcu.Action scene is great but look like video game or dc movie not marvel movie .Act is so weakness.-mcu need to change their famele privecy we don't need more woman or movies about fameles , we need movies about our favorite heros like sentry - wolverine - venom - spiderman -"
2564,1,Utter nonsense Why a anybody would cast end end barrow boy Ray Winston in a movie like this is beyond me. At best he is more suited to gangster rolls but even that would now be very challenging for this fat old age pensioner .At best maybe apart in Eastenders or remake only fools and horses but that might be a too much. Is crap Russian accent is terrible. He ruined the movie.
2565,7,"Great action, but an underwhelming story. The action was top notch, as was the cinematography and S/VFX. Casting and performances were decent, and the soundtrack had some really good remixes. But I expected much more for the 133 min runtime. The pacing was slow in some parts, and had many long and dragged out scenes. There was just too much filler and not enough substance in the story. The writers needed a little more imagination; the concept was there, but the execution wasn't as good as it could've been. Had it been trimmed down to 90-100 mins, I may have enjoyed it more. It also had lame attempts at humor - probably the worst of all MCU films, and it's not like there weren't opportunities to throw in some comic relief. For me, the most suspenseful and interesting part of the entire film, was the post-credits scene. It's a decent one-time watch."
2566,8,"Marvel pudding Yes there are lot of surprises and very good starcast, especially Florence Pugh, she nailed it.As a marvel fan it is a must watch."
2567,7,"Tough to rate First off, let's get the politics out of the way. I can't stand the movies with men being evil and women being the only good. Men bad, women good. That whole narrative. I'm sick of it. However, this isn't that kind of movie. It really isn't. Everyone in it was good. I actually enjoyed it...most of it anyway. I'll get to that in a second. But, Florence was definitely the brightest star in the movie. I love Scarlett in anything, in my opinion she always pulls off a badass hero. Harbur (sorry for the spelling) was actually a fun character. By reading the reviews first, I really thought this movie was going to a man hating, very liberal preaching, and strong feminist movie. I get some people like that kind of stuff, I just personally don't like politics in my superhero movies. This movie really wasn't that. If you find it offensive as a man, you've become too sensitive. It's an entertaining movie I'd watch again. Hell, I even want to show my dad this movie as I enjoy watching cool fight scene movies with him. It isn't the best Marvel movie, but it beats a couple of them in my opinion.Okay here's the part I just can't forgive. The reason I docked it down to a 7...almost gave it a 6, but I couldn't do that to Florence in this movie. The complete butchering of Task Master was just unforgivable. That wasn't him. Forget it being a gender swap for a moment, Task Master could have been a man and if played the same way, would be a fail. They got the character all wrong and he...she...looked awful. The guards in all black had a cooler helmet and appearance. Such a complete waste of an amazing and vastly interesting characters. Why?? Just why did they have to have Task Master in this movie? Why ruin all hopes to see a good Task Master in live action?? He should have been in a Captain America movie or at least maybe a Deadpool movie. Something where he could have shown off his incredible gift and ability, an ability he has without the silly computer goggles in that silly looking sad excuse for a paintball helmet. I've waited so long to see him in live action. The trailer killed some hope with the looks of him and being a mute for some reason. But it was so much worse. To put the cherry on top, they wasted a cool actress, Olga, in the film. Just such a frustrating and ridiculous choice to have Task Master written like this.If you can get pasted the lame paintball power ranger being controlled like a robot, I mean Task Master, you should enjoy this film. It's fun."
2568,6,"Not bad, just eh Not bad at all but the first Marvel movie I wasn't dying to see again. It's gonna be a while before I even think of coming back to this."
2569,8,"Not too bad. Not bad at all actually! Florence Pugh. That's all I can really say. She made this movie for me. She was funny, beautiful, quick witted, kicked a lot of ass and made me choke up once or twice.Of course Scarlett Johansson brought her A game as we all expected. She has made the Black Widow an enjoyable, interesting and sympathetic character for the past decade. She has taken everything we love about the character and really flexed it in this movie.Great supporting characters too. Drags on at parts, but never loses your attention."
2570,5,Would've been better without the woke casting/character 'identities' I quite enjoyed this movie but the whole woke casting/character thing is becoming a bit cliched and tiresome. Admittedly is was less in your face than a lot of other garbage we have been subjected to lately but still.
2571,2,"Below then average movie Black widow is Full of.... Disappointment.Good action less story but entire movie based on black widow's sister Yelena because she got largest screen time.Fans feel bad for taskmaster he barely got any screentime also he have no motivate just example like any chinese movie villain on screen for only fight with main lead. I feel bad for himCgi is best part of this movie. Actually movie have lots of cgi a lot. Why all screen need cgi all time.Why not add any fight scene middle of street, office or ruined plain/ship Not middle of air where everything is falling in slow motion."
2572,5,"Captain Marvel was better, not kidding. The story was disinteresting and the action over the top. These are girls not Gods if Thunder. They should be in intensive care after the first 30 minutes."
2573,3,"Watching this made me remember why I don't like Marvel Movies. I just LOVE how they used American actors to play Russians. Florence Pugh's accent change back and fourth was amazing...ly bad. She's not a bad actress... not the best either... but I just couldn't handle her inability to keep the accent.The movie, of course, was not very realistic... but that's Marvel for ya. It felt like half the movie was spent in the house... getting to know each other again, or whatever that was.I feel like every Marvel movie I see is just the same stuff, with different people. My wife and I were not impressed."
2574,5,"Feels lazy The idea of Taskmaster as a villain is an interesting concept, but here it translated into what felt like lazy filmmaking. Most of the action scenes with Taskmaster seemed copied and pasted from other Marvel films and fell flat for me. I was never really bored, but the plot twists were predictable, character development seemed forced, and there was some laughable CGI and plot holes. Worth a watch, it'll keep you entertained, but I feel like it didn't do Black Widow the justice she deserved."
2575,5,"Underwhelming and so late to the party This should have been something that the marvel bosses should have planned along with one of the phase 1 movies. Not as an afterthought after the end of phase 3. There was. Alot of expectation but the story, script and villain disappointed big time."
2576,9,I really enjoyed this movie I loved every minute of this movie the jokes loved ylenna she was amazing. Scarlett Johnson she was amazing as always. I really loved every part of this movie. Ylenna I hope to see more of her I hope to see more of her.
2577,8,Ignore the hate it's not bad I saw this earlier today and was surprised because I read non spoiler reviews and they were extremely mixed. It didn't feel too long at all and there's plenty of action. I didn't like what they did to a certain villain but it could've been worse. Took way too long to release but it's a cool film.
2578,9,"Fantastic movie, one of the best from the MCU so far! I don't understand why so many people don't like this movie. There is much action throughout, the characters are spectacular, and the post-credit scene gave me chills. Although I believe Taskmaster could have had more potential, it is still a wonderful movie and was worth seeing in the theater. I feel like the scenes with the Red Room could have been improved but overall it's a movie I would see again!"
2579,4,"The Really Cold War When I wanted them to make a stand-alone Black Widow movie all the way back to her premiering in the lackluster Iron Man 2, I kinda wanted it when she was alive. But I guess going back in time is what the MCU does best now.(Just a clarification, that's not a spoiler for this movie. It's just part of the MCU that she passes in Avengers: Endgame and that's acknowledged here.)To put my feeling for the MCU in perspective, none of the 24 Avenger movies fall into my top 20 action movies of all time. Not that they were bad, plenty of them were good to great. It's just, most of them are comedies first and action/comic book movies second...or third. Such in the case of both Iron Man 3 and Thor: Ragnarok. Both were 80% comedies with a smidge of action.Mercifully, Black Widow is less of a comedy, although the one running gag (Posing) was funny and creative and a few other jokes landed. Not terribly funny, but luckily, this isn't meant to be funny. Nope, in this case: it's 80% drama and 20% action.Don't get me wrong; 2 of the 3-4 action scenes were good, the now-overused, yet still fun climax being the best, but the action was so few and far in-between and sadly, I just didn't connect with the ""drama"" and ""sad-scenes"" very well. I never felt bad for these people, even when kids were involved. Maybe it's because the movie was SO COLD, little heart could be felt.After a solid cold opening showing our infamous Natasha Romanoff, aka The Title Character, as a kid about to become said Title Character, we fast-forward to her well-established as the Black Widow. Well, one of them, anyways. There we see her go on a very basic and simple mission with her estranged sister and family.Oh, and they probably mentioned the word ""Avengers"" more times in this movie and her connection to them than all 4 actual Avenger movies combined.My biggest problem with this movie is that I wanted to see either A: An Origin Story of her trials and tribulations of becoming my 2nd favorite Avenger behind Captain Steve Rogers or B: she's already Black Widow and she smartly kicks as much ass as she's done with every other appearance of hers in the MCU. Well, I did get about 7 minutes of that origin story and about 10 minutes of her actually being the kick-ass super-spy we all love. Those 10 minutes are the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie, and here's the problem, SHE IS BLACK WIDOW throughout the movie, sans those original 7 minutes in the cold-open. So...why do they make her so oh-hum throughout? She's not learning to become Black Widow; she's been that way since the opening credits. We just finally get her bad-assery in the closing and by then I was incredibly bored with so many overly dramatic and predictable, drawn-out scenes.But, that was my biggest issue. In truth, it wasn't that bad of the movie, even though a ton of it was generic action scenes or family drama never reaching tension. I did enjoy Scarlett, as always, but here she just felt like Sean Connery coming back for Never Say Never Again. Like this was just a paycheck for her.While it's a mild recommendation, it's not at all necessary to see this movie in connection with the others except for the weak-post credit scene (all the way at the end of the 20 minutes of credits.) It felt so much like a mid-season storyline/couple of episodes of a TV season - never as great as the first 2 episodes and definitely less fun/excitement as the season finale's last few episodes. Think of it as episode 4-6 of a 9-part TV season.***Final Thoughts: Here's my updated ranking of all the MCU movies with stars, Best to WORST:1 Marvel's The Avengers (4½/5 Stars.) 2 Captain America: The First Avenger (4½/5 Stars.) 3 Guardians of the Galaxy (4½/5 Stars.) 4 Avengers: Infinity War (4½/5 Stars.) 5 Iron Man (4/5 Stars.) 6 Captain America: The Winter Soldier (4/5 Stars.) 7 Spider-Man: Far From Home (4/5 Stars.) 8 Captain America: Civil War (3½/5 Stars.) 9 Thor: Ragnarok (3½/5 Stars.) 10 Avengers: Endgame (3½/5 Stars.) 11 Doctor Strange (3/5 Stars.) 12 Ant-Man (3/5 Stars.) 13 Ant-Man and the Wasp (3/5 Stars.) 14 Black Panther (3/5 Stars.) 15 The Incredible Hulk (3/5 Stars.) 16 Iron Man 3 (3/5 Stars.) 17 Black Widow (2½/5 Stars.) 18 Thor: The Dark World (2½/5 Stars.) 19 Avengers: Age of Ultron (2½/5 Stars.) 20 Spider-Man: Homecoming (2½/5 Stars.) 21 Iron Man 2 (2/5 Stars.) 22 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2/5 Stars.) 23 Captain Marvel (2/5 Stars.) 24 Thor (2/5 Stars.)"
2580,10,It was great... Tbh expected a Cameo of cap. Great action. Story line up could be better. Great work by the casting director.
2581,3,"Poor CGI, bellow expectation story Too bad that black widow is released after loki series, because after watch loki, my expectation about marvel studio movies is so dam high, and also black widow is giving us bad CGI, even i think avengers 2012 had better CGI than black widow, especially in sky action. And the last is, when i watch the trailer, i was expecting marvel will show us about her past, her training, her teenage life in redroom, but instead they only giving us only the ""Story"" by conversation and it disappoint me."
2582,9,"Great movie, definitely worth the wait This movie was great. The plot, characters, the dialogue, the fight scenes. All amazing to me. Ignore the hate. I loved this movie, such a great way to return to the MCU. I don't have any complaints, and I've only seen people have two minor ones that don't really affect the film. Like i said, ignore the hate, ignore the bad reviews. Definitely a great way to have Scarlett and Natasha go out with a bang."
2583,7,"Marvel and disney really hate their villains Barely any taskmaster in this film, barely any showcase of what bad asses the red room girls were like. Winter soldier did the covert operative thing way better. It's looking like this might ve the decline of the MCU ,especially with them trying to turn loki into a big softie now, having him dance and sing after he just got his ass whopped trying to acheive his goal of universal domination. Idk why disney can't let their villains be great."
2584,8,ACTION-PACKED !!! First of all I didn't think after endgame events I would see Nat's character again. But then I saw this it was such a pleasure to see Romanoff again in the screen after a long time and it's definitely a treat to watch Scarlett on the screen. Well the film has a bonus character too and that was Yelena. Yelena's character has made this movie even more higher than it should be. Story was average but the action sequences in the movie is just badass with the amazing cgi works makes the movie delight to watch. Rest of the cast has done their part as they should. Even the bgm was cool to hear nothing that will disappoint you except the storyline little bit and short of the characters or you can say not build the characters as they should otherwise movie is a treat to watch. And yes don't miss the post credit scene if you are a mcu fan....
2585,10,Last time on screen Natasha Romanov No one could have done what Scarlett has added to this character. She was my crush and will remain my crush forever. Movie was good. Genuine Entertainer. Go watch it for her .
2586,8,"I don't really understand all the bad reviews I had a good time. I wasn't bored once throughout the movie, it made sense and it flowed. The comedy relief was good, as usual from Marvel. I'm not sure what people were expecting from this movie but I think it was definitely worth watching in theaters."
2587,7,"Fun Marvel Movie. My wife and I sat and watched this on a Saturday. We expected a fun Marvel superhero movie, and that is what Scarlett gave us. I didn't expect a Shakesperian tragedy which some reviewers seem to expect. There was one Hollywood trend that stood out in this movie but is not confined to this movie. It was also noticeable in ""The Tomorrow War"". If you've seen both movies you know the trend I'm talking about and I don't believe it's helpful to our society at large. Great graphics and action sequences and I don't worry too much about the integrity of dialogue in an action flick. Loved the performances af the four main characters. WIll probably watch it again sometime. Great way to kill some time and entertaining. I'm not sure what more a good action flick is supposed to do."
2588,8,"Great action TBH, I don't understand all the hatorade...I thought this was an enjoyable movie with a lot of great action. I didn't find the movie to be slow at all. You have to suspend belief for any super hero movie, and this is no different. Natasha is a bad @$$, but she still has a heart (thus her sacrifice in Endgame). Plus we all know that 'families', real or contrived, have their own dynamics that bring up lots of baggage. I also enjoyed Rachel Weiss in her role. I find it to be another solid entry in the MCU. The best? No. Entertaining? Absolutely."
2589,7,"Top Notch Execution The action, the humor and perfomances were all great. Had very very low expectations and the overall quality of the final product surprised me a lot. Well done."
2590,3,"Watched just because it's MCU Worst MCU movie maybe ? Normally I don't give a negative review as I like to see something positive from the movie. But this one was a waste of time. There was no reason to release this movie now after endgame, plot is near to none , half of the time you will not understand why there is too much of action. First half of movie is too boring , second half is at least watchable.Wandavision , Loki are much better than this movie."
2591,6,"🎶It's a family afaaaaaaaaaair, it's a family affaaaaaaaaaair.🎶 This superhero movie does something a little bit different. The story-line follows the Romanov family. Not just sporadic parts dotted here and there throughout the film. The family angle takes front and center stage the entire time with the interest increasing as that time progresses.The story follows the family as various members go forth searching for the mysterious ""Red Room"". All the while running / hunting for the mysterious man in the mask.As a side note, I find it fascinating how women in the Marvel universe can only fight if their body parts are busting out of their clothing.As with all films there is the one character that makes the movie interesting. One that has that special something. In this case it's. Florence Pugh - the sister.All in all nothing special so it gets a 6.0."
2592,10,AWESOME ACTING AND STORY This movie was everything I expected from a No superpowered hero. Jason Bourne films style. Finally MCU gave Scarlett Johansson the opportunity to show her acting skills. By the way Florence Pugh was awesome. She will be a great Black Widow. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz have a great chemistry in this movie and all together was a great cast. People giving hard criticism probably DC fans. They love boycotting MCU.
2593,10,Forget about the negative reviews. This movie is awesome. ITS AN AMAZING MOVIE. A FAREWELL TO NATASHA. I really hope to see more movies like this one. Loved the writing.
2594,9,"Most excellent. Go see it in the theater I had basically no expectations and was very pleasantly surprised when the movie turned out to be excellent.Black Widow is not a full origin story, as we see only glimpses of her upbringing. It is much more of a family story. All the actors and actresses in this movie are amazing. Especially Florence Pugh is giving a stellar performance. I really hope we get to see more of her character.I also liked that the pace of the movie was occasionally much slower than other Marvel movies. There are longer stretches where the acting and the story carry the movie. I became aware of this when I noticed that there was basically no CGI during these scenes. Thanks to the cast, these scenes were never boring or felt unnecessary.The humor is well-placed and entertaining without turning the movie into a comedy. Also, the 3D worked well and elevated several scenes.Note that (most of) the story takes place in 2016, after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"". However, the movie completely stands on its own feet. There are, of course, some references to Captain America and the Avengers but you don't need to know these movies to understand or follow ""Black Widow"".9/10. Go see it - ideally in a movie theater."
2595,8,"A Fun Return to the Theater Black Widow's numerous delays combined with a constant want for her own big screen solo outing, and the fact that this is the first MCU film apart of Phase Four likely caused a lot of people to build this movie up in there heads. While by no means a bad film (what marvel movie is?) ""Black Widow"" is an action packed spy drama somewhere in the realm of Mission: Impossible. The Actors are all phenomenal in this film with the core ""family"" Johansson, Pugh, Weisz, and Harbour giving it their respective best. The film also has a nice lighting design and well choreographed action if not always well shot. Shortland's direction is great and I hope to see more from her in the future. This doesn't rank among Marvels best, but it's not supposed to. This is a good movie and a welcome return to the films of the MCU. I look forward to see if Pugh's character will grow from this point."
2596,1,Disappointing The movie is complicated..and Natasha is a perfectionist.... the story doesn't make any sense...even Captain Marvel was better than this in storyline.....i would suggest not to waste your data.
2597,7,"Too much ""soapy rom com"" not enough ""WOW"" ! Yet another action movie that can't decide if it's supposed to be a tear-jerking, heart warming movie about ""family"" or an action packed superhero extravaganza.This needed a different director. One who could tell the difference between an ""action"" movie and a ""lets get in touch with our feelings"" movie and not try to combine the two into a watered down version of either."
2598,1,"Years of waiting for this boring movie I regret spending my hard earned money to pay and stream this disappointing movie. Overhyped movie as usual of Marvel. Acting was bad and bland, cgi and cinematography was average, plot was riddled with holes, ending was a mess."
2599,3,Meh Big meh. I have to add more because its too short but that how short this movie came up.
2600,8,"Fun Fun movie decent plot and depth, cool villains. If you like superhero movies you'll like this one.Relax, have fun, you'll enjoy it.Already rewatched it, enjoyed it again. Catch so many instances where rather than using movie magic they make a point to show how they get away. First task master encounter you see Natasha open the case. The tourniquet delay when in pursuit for bait taskmaster.This movie really spoke to Natasha's superpower, the super spy.Wanted to lower it to a 7, but I think due to unnecessary hate and high expectations I'll keep it here. Do my part to get more people to see it."
2601,10,just awesome movie I just love the movie and story line is awesome . And the black widow is just awesome. I love the movie 100 out of 100.
2602,7,Mid Tier Marvel Movie This movie is far from bad but not great. Pugh and Harbor are good additions to the MCU but the film falls short in a few areas. The main area being the Villian. The Villian Task Master is mostly uninteresting and the plot twist of his identity was an eyeroll moment for me.
2603,1,I have no idea why female lead superhero movies doesn't work 😓 As a mcu phase 4 movie lack of action is the main problem. There is so short action scenes in this movie... cgi is total garbage. When it comes to 3rd act they're so messed up.. didn't do a justice for natasha romanoff. David harbor and reachel are useless characters. Taskmaster is so disappointing... yelena shined more than scarjo. Hope in future there will be great female lead superhero movies.
2604,10,Incredible movie Highly enjoyable. Don't listen to all the negative reviews on here. My family & a friends family loved it. Florence Pugh was fantastic. David Harbour was amazing. Rachel Weisz was uncanny and Scarlett Johansson was INVINCIBLE as Natasha Romanoff. Fun movie. Go out and see this movie. Highly enjoyable. Go out among the humans to a theater and see this. Spectacular film.
2605,1,"Trash in terms of Marvel Standards Seriously this is it?! The movie is boring and really just drags on. There were hardly any action or fighting scenes and what little they did have was very mediocre. It felt like a spy/agent movie and nothing as good as what Marvel typically puts out. It felt as if they didn't even bother with the story and just quickly threw together something and stuck ""Black Widow"" as the title."
2606,6,"Long Wait & Dissapointed May be this is the only movie I was waiting so long to watch, finally after many postpones it released but the film disappointed me. Positive thing about the movie is only the actors 1. Florence 2. Scarlet. Bad part is Plot, stunts, CGI.Surprise element Olga for few seconds. A small feel of watching Natasha character at the ending."
2607,9,"The movie anyone can expect with Black Widow story This movie is all about Black widow's past still hunting her until after the civil war. It's an action-filled movie that's why i loved it. Maybe the timing of this film were too late for the hype, but other than that it was a great film. Gonna miss Nat so much after this. We love u nat!!"
2608,6,"Disappointing Scarlet gets sidelined in her own movie also just bizarre acting and clunky writing for her. Felt like she was playing herself not Natasha in a bad way.Florence and David save the movie and simultaneously steal every scene.Rachel Weisz was fine but it felt like most of her scenes involved exposition.Action was fine, but it was hard to tell who was fighting who.Comedic bit were good. However, one was very unnecessary the other was ill timed.Overall, the movie is fine, nevertheless the negatives outweigh the positives in my book."
2609,4,"It's ok... Weird jumps around, INSANELY drug out boring scenes, all the main character are basically indestructible in the fight scenes, villain is kinda boring, fight scenes were decent, really doesn't get interesting until closer to the end. I assumed everyone we met in the movie would die at the end because we never saw any of them in another movie. But NOPE they just legit never showed up in anything else. The best part of the whole movie was the end credit scene, it's really the only reason i give this above a 3/10."
2610,6,"Disappointing There are really good action scenes but the whole movie has one big problem...it has no good story and therefore its boring. There are also a lot if plot holes... there's a sky station full of unstoppable widows and they have incapable male guards to protect it...why? And even the ""plot twists"" are not really surprising. Very disappointing overall. 6 stars for the well choreographed action...even if Romanoff is acting more like a half goddess then a human being...falling from a rooftop and landing on her feet...oh come on."
2611,10,"Yep, 10 out of 10 for what I judged Pugh was amazing in this and her and Johanson worked so well together, chemistry was so natural between the two. I only wish there could be more of them in the future.Black Widow has deserved her own movie for a long time and they have done her justice here. The action was fun and bad ass to watch.If you're a fan of the MCU, you will love this addition."
2612,5,"Black Widow deserved better Post credits scene confirms Black Widow's death and her sister is given the assignment to kill Hawkeye. This means this was Black Widow's last appearance at least as far as a solo movie is concerned. I think Black Widow deserved a better movie than this. She's been in the MCU since the beginning and given her skills a great movie could have been made. I mean the comics exist so why such a stupid story. I have no problem with the cast of this movie. It's the story and the CGI climax.The supporting cast is great and Florence Pugh carried this movie. It's not Scarlett's fault. Her character was not great on screen, again a problem in the writing department. Dad's character was pretty lame as well. Taskmaster could have been great but was not used properly.Talking about the plot. It was all over the place. I was looking forward to a great one on one fighting sequence between the Black Widow and the Taskmaster but instead got unnecessary CGI mess. That too cheap CGI.Marvel has all the resources in the world to make a great movie for one of their most popular heroes but instead we got this straight-to-dvd feel flick."
2613,9,"Marvel saved this for a theater- for a reason I'm blown away by this film. Everything hit perfectly. I loved the smaller cast, the family dynamic. Florence Pugh will be a perfect addition to the MCU. Scarlett continues to be a incredible weapon for Marvel.I'm not going to spoil anything. Go see this baby ASAP. And ignore the ridiculous haters."
2614,10,"MUCH better than expected I thought this movie was great! It was fast-paced without trying too hard and it kept my attention the entire time. Florence Pugh was amazing and I think this was a great introduction of her into the Marvel universe. I am not even a fan of Scarlett Johansen or Black Widow as a character, but she was more likable than she ever has been in this movie. As a stand-alone side movie in the Marvel universe, I found it completely satisfying and entertaining. Don't listen to all these bad reviews!"
2615,9,"Great movie with a few huge mess ups... It was an all around good movie introducing new characters and exploring the possibility of another Black Widow taking over, but they absolutely destroyed one of the best Marvel Villains. I'm a huge fan of Taskmaster and honestly how they did him almost pushes me to give this movie a 1. If it wasn't a good cast with an amazing new black widow on the way this movie would be trash."
2616,7,"Really Fun Ride I had a lot of fun watching this movie. There was a particular weight to it, given Natasha's fate in Endgame, and it really stuck through to the end. Florence Pugh was excellent and I'm excited to see more of her in the MCU. I'm very invested in the MCU storyline and seeing so much of Natasha in this was very satisfying and a great way to round out her story.The only disappointment I really had was Taskmaster - once again, Marvel falls a little flat with the villain. They miss far more than they hit, and this was another miss. I really hope to get another villain with the caliber of Killmonger someday (Thanos and Loki I would put in a different class since they are recurring.)"
2617,10,Best MCU movie I have seen This was the first MCU movie I have seen in theaters and I got to say I am so glad that this is my first one I've seen in the movie theater! It was a great film Scarlett Johansson did an awesome job yet again she really is an amazing person all around and nobody can black widow like she can! And even though it's the origin story it's still the best way to say Goodbye to the character.
2618,10,It's all about family ! Amazing movie ! Scarlett did a amazing job as a black widow over a decade. And this movies shows us how family have your back now matter what. Good movie with lot of comedies.
2619,5,It's unimportant like Naruto's filler episodes Nothing important. Nothing interesting. Only to create a cause for something much important for the upcoming movies. Didn't understand why it was so hyped. Not gonna say it's a bad movie. But it probably is.
2620,8,"Get over yourselves. This movie is entertaining and fun. It seems a lot of people have forgotten how to suspend their sense of disbelief these days, and it seems those of you leaving poor reviews have never actually seen a bad movie, a real one star worthy film. This is not that. Lighten up, have a snack and enjoy the film in front of you. I will be watching this one over and over just like the rest of the marvel films. It's actually not that deep, it's a superhero movie so enjoy. This movie is overdue, yes. But being overdue doesn't discount it automatically.Peace and love."
2621,6,"NoOne milks a Cow, like Marvel does... NOONE!!! Marvel: You're finally getting your own movie.Scarlet: Oh' Really?Marvel: As long as it'll be used as a backstory of our future Avenger in Phase4.Scarlet: whatever? What's my Paycheck ?!?Honestly, I watched the whole thing without being getting bored due to sheer talent onscreen not due to writing or direction. However, the moment i finished, I instantly forgot as well. Problem with Marvel is that once everything you put out becomes a brand. They see storylines as how it can move their other movies like Phase4 or show Hawkeye here. It doesn't serve the story or character you're watching atall. Everything has to connect to something in the future. The untimely forced humour and video games like CGI in the end has become cringing but hey I watched it for free so no complaints."
2622,8,"Enjoyed it! Either you are a fan of PG-13 Marvel movies or you are not. If you are, this was a very fun watch and in the top half of Marvel movies in my opinion.Besides Scarlett Johansson who is always first class, you have Florence Pugh who really stole some scenes and then the always welcome Rachel Weisz and the good humor of David Harbour. An all-star cast for a standalone Marvel hero movie.The plot was fairly standard but meeting Natasha's ""family"" and seeing the dynamics between them was a lot of fun.The action sequences ranged from good to jaw dropping at one point. I saw it in IMAX and especially the climactic action scene was crazy and something I hadn't seen before, and I realized how much I missed something like that on a big screen.Anyone rating this movie less than 6 has an alternative agenda. Very solid superhero movie, excellent cast that made it fun, and worth the trip to the theater."
2623,7,Love to watch. The story was well written and design. Every scene was exciting and enjoyable to watch. Although the sequence of the MCU universe well continues.
2624,6,"Good, but skippable. It's good. It's the MCU. It has a familiar character in a familiar universe and is competently shown.The first act felt like a Marvel Bourne movie(which is not a criticism). The rest felt kind of like Falcon and Winter Soldier. It did fill in some backstory but largely felt like the stakes were on par with Ant-Man or Dr. Strange(i.e. Kinda fun but it doesn't matter that much). If only this was a slightly more influential story told earlier in the MCU, it would have been a homerun.In summary, generally well executed but about 8 years too late."
2625,5,"Better than I expected but I wasn't expecting much The action scenes were cool (except for a few parts where the heros should have clearly died even in mcu universe and they were fine) and David harbour was great as usual but it was just an ""ehh"" kind of movie."
2626,3,"Finding Dreykov My biggest criticism with Black Widow is its script. This film honestly had the potential to be something great: it had the budget, the talent, and a well known main character. Nearly every issue with this film stems from the screenplay.The biggest issue? The antagonist. Dreykov is one of the worst MCU villains to date. The script made him a fragile old man who has a quick temper, but doing this literally ruins his role as an antagonist. Antagonists are supposed to be strong and intimidating, and if not, then smart and manipulative. Dreykov has none of those attributes, and at this point, I don't know if it was a good thing or a bad thing for him to get such little screen time. He also emits a pheromone that makes it so that no one can attack him if they smell him, so there's that I guess.The plot is also really uninteresting. The film takes most of its time trying to find Dreykov, but how could I be interested in finding Dreykov if I never saw him before. Also, the motive for finding Dreykov is that he mind controls black widows, and he controls an evil organization. So we want to get to Dreykov for the most basic reasons, and we never saw him before, great job with creating a strong plot, screenwriters.There are tons more problems with this film, but this review would be too long if I started listing them all, so lets get into the good parts. The action is really good. The choreography was great and the action scenes were creative and grand. Weirdly though, the CGI suddenly got a lot worse at the end. Scarlett Johansson did a solid job, but Florence Pugh carried a lot of the heavy load. David Harbour was supposed to be the comedic relief, but the best jokes came from Pugh. Her character is also pretty likable, so I guess that helps a lot.Overall, Black Widow is lightyears away from being perfect. The plot is long and uninterestingly weak. The main antagonist can literally be some ones grandpa, and the supporting characters were all bland, with the exception being Yelena. There are great action scenes, but action can't carry any movie, even if its an action movie. This film is a 3/10; I was originally going to give it a 5, but the more I kept writing, the more I realized how flawed this movie is. Now I'm just hoping Marvel Studios and Disney do a better job with their next movies."
2627,5,Boring Movie I am really disappointed after all this time waiting.
2628,8,"Black Widow is more like version of a Jason Bourne but it was a good movie Black Widow is more like version of a Jason Bourne but it was a good movie and had some great funny moments. I really enjoyed the storyline and all the action packed scenes. In my opinion, this movie should have been released after Captain America: Civil War instead of releasing it now. We already know what happened to Natasha but it's important to see this now because the characters will appear in future movies and on Disney Plus."
2629,10,"Amazing Don't listen to the haters. They're either mad about how this movie is about strong, powerful women, or they're just angry about how there weren't any cameos. The movie is good, judge it for yourself."
2630,6,"Black Widow deserved better I love marvel and was really excited for this one. I thought it had a pretty strong intro but fell apart after that. The whole plot of the movie is kinda paced weird and feels like a bunch of incoherent, random scenes loosely strung together. A crazy incident will occur and then the next scene everything will be fine and there will be no commentary on said crazy incident. In my theater pretty much all the comedy was a miss, it felt like they were going for a darker tone in this movie, which I was down for, but they constantly cut it down with humor that just wasn't hitting. The action was jittery and janky, I expect better from a huge company like Marvel at this point. For example the fight between Red Guardian and Taskmaster in the trailer looked awesome, but in the movie they constantly cut to other characters and you never got to see just pure uninterrupted action. Actually you did but it was Fast and Furious 9 levels of ridiculousness. The villains are TERRIBLE. Taskmaster fans are going to hate the character in this movie, they seriously butchered that aspect. Florence Pugh and David Harbour are two of the newcomers and I would say the two brightest spots of the movie & of course it's awesome to see ScarJo taking on the Black Widow mantle one last time. This movie should have been made years ago and it should have been made by passionate people with a genuinely great story to tell, instead it feels like they're telling a generic story here because they HAD to. ScarJo deserved better..period."
2631,8,Why all the bad reviews? I actually enjoyed this movie and I can't wait for the rest of this year's MCU filmsI'm so glad Black Widow finally got her own solo film.
2632,10,"Deserves a better rating than a 7.2!!! I absolutely loved this movie! Scarlett Johansson absolutely killed her performance along with the new supporting character Yelena played by Florence Pugh. Yelena brought unexpected humor that had the whole theatre laughing out loud (definitely a great casting choice). David Harbour also had an incredible performance in playing Alexei. I loved that this movie explained Natasha's backstory and showed what she went through growing up. This movie also delivered the bad ass side of Black Widow in her action scenes. I was very interested how Marvel was going make a movie that would give fans a proper goodbye to Black Widow and let's just say the movie definitely lived up to my expectations! 10/10 review for sure, this movie needs the better ratings it deserves!"
2633,10,Fun and exciting Don't listen to the sexist a**holes who reviewed this movie. It's action packed and the characters are well crafted. Florence Pugh is definitely leading us into the next generation of fantastic female action stars.
2634,7,"Shines in pieces An espionage thriller taken effectively with a different punch compared to typical Marvel movies.The plot has depth and meaning, action is swift, comic timing is crisp, with a backbone of family and borderline emotions.Scarlett Johansson carried her character well and beyond. Florence Pugh is the icing on the cake.A bit long overall but the story makes it up. Black Widow shines in pieces!"
2635,1,"Natasha is a terrorist, not a hero Let something marinate in your brain for a little: Natasha willingly used a little innocent girl as a walking bomb to kill her enemy. Only terrorists do things like that. There should be no redemption for that, no forgiveness.I don't understand how somebody with such background can be called a hero."
2636,1,Again with the upvoting campaign I give this movie a 1 strictly to balance out the ridiculous upvoting. I really find it annoying when people trying to lie and say a movie is awesome when it really isnt. If it werent for all the users giving this movie 8 or 9 stars then i would put its actual imdb rating at 5.0. This movie is one of those long and boring action movies. Explosions and fights scenes CAN NOT make up for bad writing!Hollywood really needs to rethink how women are cast in traditionally male roles. You can't just put any actor in any role. Bad casting makes it difficult to believe the character and makes the movie hard to sit through.Every 15 minutes I found myself checking how much time i had left before this movie was over.
2637,5,pretty good but didn't do anything for the MCU or for scarlett It was pretty good I kept thinking more was gonna happen or change or be revealed and I was surprised the end was actually the end. Some things just did not make sense and the family chemistry was def awkward at points. The sisters (Florence and Scarjo) were great together but the private contractor and other characters were just kind of pointless. Overall it did not do much to the Marvel storyline and I would have liked more.
2638,4,"On the edge of being a good superhero film parody, but it's a real film (or is it still a very close parody?) Black Widow has the potential to be a good superhero film parody, but it tries too hard to be serious.The film is riddled with problems: general storytelling is broken, the pacing is messed up, not a single joke worked on me, the action is ok but rarely shot well.There is very little to enjoy in this, all the family drama was almost good, and it kinda worked isolated, but not in the context of the whole film. It's hard to get invested in their dysfunctional pseudo-family drama when the characters are constantly trying to goof around making silly jokes for the younger kids. I did enjoy Rachel Weisz's acting though, her accent and overall presence in the frame were solid. Harbour was absolutely wasted, his character is only annoying. The two ""sisters"" barely have any dynamic and mostly feel like old friends from college all grown up trying to make it look like they are still friends 10 years after graduation.What also didn't make sense was the scale of the action scenes. When I'm watching the Avengers I am ok with godlike creatures like Thor or a super-strong Hulk taking huge amounts of damage and feeling all good in the next scene. But this is Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, she would've actually died in the first like 30 minutes of the film. The ""sisters"" also look and act not like superheroes, and not like secretly highly trained operatives. They never look menacing or professional. They just look like your average girls doing a cosplay party. It's not even about their physique (although the first half of the film really banks on ""rear-back"" shots of Scarlett Johansson), it's about their movement, speed, and technique. Just watch how Keanu Reeves moves in John Wick and compare it to this one.This whole Red Room thing is weird. Dreykov is boring and he looks like a generic middle-tier henchman, yet he hides in a flying super-fortress. His safety mechanism was just adopting some sort of DNA programming ripped straight from Demolition Man (1993). He's like a really bad James Bond villain, he gives away all his plans for no reason and cares too much about Romanoff. This Taskmaster guy turns out to be Olga Kurylenko, which is...just weird, but she can definitely handle playing someone with zero personality. I've read a lot of negative feedback about this one, but I'm not familiar with the source material so it didn't hurt me as much, he(she) was just a super-boring version of Ultron or something.I actually almost killed myself with laughter after the ""feromone block"" and ""sever the nerve"". This was probably the only good joke in the whole film, yet they took it seriously.There's also a weird subplot about magical dust that gives everyone back their personality, but it's not even worth talking about.Black Widow (2021) would've been an average superhero film if it was made in the early 2000s, but in 2021, and especially after Infinity War and Endgame...come on, guys.I'd love this to be different, a straight-up drama with bits of good action, or a full-on parody. This one tries to be lots of things at once, further made worse by directional inexperience which shows in every scene.I can't recommend this film to anyone, really. Not because of what it is, but because it's almost 2 hours long, and the pacing just kills it."
2639,3,"Average Movie After Wandavision, TFATWS, and then poor old Loki, (We miss you loki) I had a feeling this was going to be an average movie.They ruined Star Wars and now they're ruining Marvel.Shame on you Disney."
2640,4,"Sadly the most pointless marvel movie to date. So for our first trip to the cinema in over a year and a half, my son's and I were looking forward to seeing the MCU back on the big screen and seeing Black Widow. Sadly I never thought I would say this as a massive die hard marvel fan but this was the most boring and pointless MCU film to date. The first hour was extremely boring and this film added nothing new to the MCU. Having established its time frame, we knew the ending before it even got going and that added to it being even more boring and predictable. Evan the action scenes were boring and predictable and nothing new to add to the experience. On the plus was nice seeing william HURT again and made us really want him back chasing the hulk. This may have been better coming out a few years ago, say maybe before infinity war but not now. Sorry marvel but this film is the weakest of the MCU and maybe a few years to late to arrive."
2641,4,"ooof, that was not the marvel movie we expected 10 min in and you know the smell is going to linger for the rest of your comfort. Unfortunately this feels more like a mediocre tv series with lots of unoriginal drama and soap.There is a heavy emphasis on family and the 'feminine'. The irony being that these actors couldn't lift half the stuff IRL - if the props were real. They rely on cool CGI and tough dialogue lines and all the other 'been there done that' bravado. Way too much.Not sure what's going on here. If it is crap directing, or poor material writing in general. Not even interesting cameos or other marvel characters make an entry. Super super lame the latter.Perhaps they were playing it safe and had braindead focus groups. Or perhaps the writers are out of touch or stuck in the past. The locations feel tacky and not very well integrated. It kind of jumps from this drama to the next drama event and becomes dull with the broken record tune of the awful past everyone was subjected to blabla bla. Gosh, talk about overstaying the welcome.It's a shame, the studio and producers probably knew the reception consensus and the opinion polls. Hence why we saw much marketing and tv spots and so forth. This has been so long in the making - and this is what we get????"
2642,1,"Totally sucks😤😤 marvel should hire some realistic director Totally sucks,I'll waiting for this very long time.and it's coming with bomb really clueless,no story ,no sense just bunch of garbage character 😤😤"
2643,10,"Marvel Does Bond! I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would after reading so many terrible reviews by IMDb reviewers. This was a nice change of pace from the typical superhero fare that Marvel does so well, but so many times that it often just the same story with the heroes and villains shuffled about.To my eyes this came across as a Bond film on steroids (with a nice nod to him in an easter egg that gave me a grin when I saw it). The acting was stellar with Pugh stealing the show and solidly puts her in the most likely to be seen again in the MCU. Don't pay attention to all the negative reviews. Just strap in for a fun new ride in the MCU."
2644,6,"I thought it was fun. Mostly your average Marvel movie. The fight scenes were pretty bland, which is a shame, but the acting was fantastic all around. I've never read the comics so I had no expectations for characters like Taskmaster, but the ultimate conclusion for what was a character I found interesting quickly fell flat. There's also the strange habit of characters switching between Russian and English with no real reason- IE someone says something in english and the other responds in russian instead.My biggest issue is the fact that somehow nobody thought to stop them from putting a Twilight Sparkle doll from the 2011 MLP:FiM show (I actually own the exact same one) in 1995."
2645,5,"Disappointing, but not unwatchable First off as others have stated Florence Pugh is the highlight of this, her performance was fantastic and in my opinion she saved the movie.This was originally supposed to be an origins film but instead it takes place after Civil War. This was probably my biggest disappointment considering Marvel has been teasing the backstory for so long and we didn't get it in the Black Widow stand alone film.The CGI in many of the fight scenes is borderline laughable and it makes you wonder what they spent the budget on.It's not unwatchable but I can't believe that this is what marvel/disney thought was worth delaying for so long. Those giving this high ratings must be studio plants, because as a long time fan I was dissapointed."
2646,6,"Kinda Disappointing But Still Fun Marvel fcked up big time with this one, this movie should've come out in 2016 or 2017 right after Civil War. As emotional as it was, imagine how much more emotional Nat's death would've been in Endgame if we saw this movie.The intro of this movie was amazing and the first half was fine, but it fell apart in the second half.My disappointments:I'm disappointed this wasn't a spy movie.The editing for some parts was really weird and it felt like they cut out some frames in between, broke the continuity multiple times.Also wth was that 'smelly no hurt me' line? I was laughing at that goofy line for 30 seconds. Couldn't they hire better writers? It was one of the goofiest lines I've ever heard.The movie was disappointing enough, but it's still fun to watch.At least I'd rather watch this again than Captain Marvel! At least this one had some emotions in it, even though they were ruined with classic marvel lame jokes multiple times.And also, is Valentina becoming the new Nick Fury (well kinda the naughty version Nick Fury) of marvel recruiting these guys and gals in the post credits?"
2647,7,"Incredible and dissapointment Taskmaster was ruined, It pushed PG-13 to its limits it was good but taskmaster was just ruined."
2648,5,Waiting for the second part!... NEVER For real? Not the moment... Not important... Not necessary... My time was more important... What have I done?! Lol.
2649,1,"Very dissapointing I feel like the trailers prommised something big something epic but it ended up just beeing a very meh movie Taskmaster is one of my favorite marvel characters but they did him so dirty they changed his skin color, gender and made his Powers into simple tech wich is very dissapointing when you want some natural powers 1/10 Not good."
2650,6,"Perfectly enjoyable superhero flick Black Widow is a perfectly enjoyable superhero flick. It comes with everything you expect from any Marvel movie. A huge VFX budget, smirkable one-liners and some feel good political correctness. Woo girl power! But Black Widow does nothing to raise itself from the flock and make it alongside the greats such as Ironman, Doctor Strange or Infinity War. The cinematography is fine, the actors are fine, the issue comes with the villain. It seems like the script writers were a little too focused on women good, white man bad, that they forgot to give the villain literally any motivation at all. Just a copy paste evil man with a hidden layer and a legion of faceless goons. The movie has it's moments, but it's too busy being a good superhero movie, and neglects being a good movie in itself."
2651,10,"Black Widow is awesome. You need to watch this movie. This is honestly the most awesome movie that I've ever seen since Avengers Endgame. Don't listen to these other critics that are talking trash about the movie. Because they do not know what they are talking about. Calling this movie boring is just not ok. And Taskmaster? Who cares if it's a female!? THE MOVIE IS STILL GOOD PEOPLE!!!! And the villain herself is good as well. So please. Stop trashing this movie. And no I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy. I am speaking true, detailed facts. This movie is awesome. On all levels. And yes, including the action."
2652,7,"Totally worth a one time watch. This was good. Turns out, hardcore Marvel fans are super disappointed with it but I haven't read any of the original storylines, so I don't care. And if you're like me, you'll also enjoy this movie as long as you give it the cinematic liberty that every Marvel movie needs. The action was epic in the first half of the movie, think Jason Bourne. The OST was good.That said, the plot...you can tell that this was written because people wanted it, because Marvel/Disney could make more money off of it. I so wish it had released after Civil War, the impact of the events of Infinity War/End Game would have been very different. I don't think the plot does justice to any of the other characters, so that was a let down, the good ones and the bad.Natasha Romanoff isn't spoken about enough, an earlier release might have done some justice, especially to Scarlett. She's usually in the conversation for her looks first and then everything else, when she's actually a badass and deserves more props. Better late than never, I guess.Florence Pugh did a really good job as well. Her work in ""Fighting with my family"" was really good too, check it out if you haven't. Speaking of ""Family"", they mention the word SO MANY TIMES in Black Widow as well, couldn't take it xDOverall, totally worth a watch. Don't care much about the original storyline. Maybe it could have been better but didn't mind it. One time watch, though."
2653,5,"Bland, directionless and 6 years too late Black Widow had a very strong opening, but fell flat on its face for the following hour & fifty minutes. The choppy scrapped together action sequences, unfulfilling character arcs & horrendous 1 liners/comedy were concerning for future MCU. Tbh it's ab 6 years too late.2.6 / 5."
2654,2,"Don't waste your time. What's the story here? If it weren't for Pugh this movie would be a total waste. She was the only one worth watching. Where's the bad guy, where's the story?"
2655,5,Enjoyable but disappointing While the film overall is enjoyable. For those who know anything about the comics or even played the games the fact they have so heavily messed up task master's character is awful beyond belief. And the entire story of this film just feels like it underwhelmed natasha's story arc in endgame. Incredible Hulk and iron man 3 were better received than this will.
2656,3,"Overwhelmingly Mediocre This is character who deserved better than what she got for a solo film. I knew we were in trouble when the opening credits had an ambien induced cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" The tone is all over the place and doesn't feel like a cohesive story. It jumps between cringey comedy to downer drama like pieces from different movies were sewn together.Black Widow deserves better."
2657,5,"Generic story, poorly told, with fairly lame action This was a very subpar Marvel film even just as far as Marvel films go.For a movie about Black Widow, you would reasonably be expecting a Jason Bourne/James Bond type spy thriller action movie here with a female lead. And the movie tries its best to deliver on that promise. But unfortunately, as far as action-spy flicks go this one is mediocre in every respect to those other films.It's surprisingly dull. The action that exists is lifeless and brief and too spaced out. The story never grabbed me even from the beginning. No emotional investment was developed with the characters.Feel free to skip this one."
2658,5,"Yawn Overall a pretty boring movie. The beginning was great and what had me give it as many stars as I did. However, it then drags on with boring action and poor comedy. The biggest downfall of the movie is the same as lots of other super hero movie; bad villain."
2659,9,"I had fun at the movies again. Debate where this story belongs in the Marvel canon, but I had fun at the movies again. First time back inside a movie house in quite awhile, and it took Scarlett and Marvel to do it.This film has all of the familiarity of other Marvel films but cranks up the fight choreography and sudden jumps into heavy action. The two leads of Scarlett and Florence are fantastic. More of the memorable lines and actions go to Florence but that is fair as we have seen Scarlett and her character evolve and grow over the course of several Marvel movies.I got vibes of Moonraker, Ice Station Zebra, and bits of Star Wars dropped in. And they even revived Don McLean's wonderful song as a theme and binder for the characters. A fun time at the movies. Enjoy!"
2660,10,Great Personally I think this movie went up to my expectations I thought it was good. Had lots of action with funny scenes.
2661,8,"Not as bad as everyone implies Apparently I'm the only one who truly enjoyed this movie. My major test of a movie is if I ever think about the time which I didn't, I was engrossed the entire time. I loved that there wasn't just non-stop action and we really got to see inside some of the characters. People just love focusing on all the things wrong with a movie, it's just human nature. I will focus on how much I enjoyed this movie and I might see it again."
2662,8,"Really enjoyed. Would put ahead of 10 other marvel movies Thought it was better then almost half the other movies marvel has done. So I really enjoyed it, good storyline, acting, new characters. Plenty of action as well. Def worth the watch and rewatches."
2663,6,She's a HUMAN! With no powers! What bothers me the most about how they handle the Black Widow character is they they try to keep her pretty and unscathed at all times! She broke her nose and just had a little blood. Once she whipped it you couldn't even tell!!! And 2 weeks later her face would have bruising!!! BUT NOOOOO! Even when she gets into crazy fights and falls out of the sky she just has a little dirt on her. LOL 😹
2664,9,Lil Babes My lil Babes loved it and that's all that matters!
2665,3,WHAT IS THAT?! I think marvel can do better than this. Because we talk about BLACK WIDOW!
2666,10,"All the Elements of a good film. It's even family friendly! No it is not, but it is an action packed journey of excitement and entertainment."
2667,9,"Fun for family ... Has a Girl Power Story I actually walked in kinda skeptical .... But, it really got started well. So, then after its foundation was laid I was rather impressed by its progress and the fact that it sustained its premise. It takes some time to let its meat marinade ... But it gels and is worth a really fun ride! Stay for the after credit scenes! Enjoy!"
2668,10,"Good bay Black widow This was a really good movie. It ranks second in MCU movies, which is good. It's very bad that you know the end of a character , but you watch the movie, this one reduces the excitement. Scarlett was great as always, and we were going to miss the black widow. The sequence after the titration is a way to new events, And it showed that Valentina is a bad person, in fact a enemy."
2669,9,"a solid 9. I absolutely LOVED it. Really.I don't know if it's my favoritism towards ScarJo, Florence Pugh and Black Widow herself talking louder, but it's a great movie in general.I just wish there were more dialogue and fewer misplaced jokes (they're great jokes, but I believe there were more appropriate moments to place them)Really good movie!! I hope to watch it again as soon as possible!!:)"
2670,8,"Not the best Marvel outing, but still a great movie Don't listen to the negativity, make up your own mind.I was saddened to see the luke-warm to negative reviews, but then I realised - they are always there.This movie is worthy of the MCU, do I wish it had been released years ago, maybe after Civil War? Yes, but then it wouldn't function as Black Widow's ""swansong"".Seeing more on the history of this character is long overdue.Florence Pugh is outstanding in this film, and Johanssen is as good as ever.WW84 wishes it could be as good as this."
2671,6,"Disappointment For me, Black Widow was most anticipated film for this year (2021) and I am not even a hardcore comic book fan. Perhaps my expectations were high. Perhaps because like other red blood men, I have always had a crush on Scarlett Johansson. But besides the car chase scene and the fight seen at the end, the only other good part was watching Scarlett in her black and then white outfit kicking some butt.But, oh my God, why did this turn into blame the parents for a lousy upbringing FML drama? This is the problem with allowing Disney to own too many entertainment companies. Why the cringeworthy comedy? The character development is paper thin. Disney, stop buying movie studios. You are ruining the entire art form of film making with your cookie cutter dramas. Stick to cartoons."
2672,9,SO GOOD The action was amazing with the family story! Little slow in parts but I was laughing and super engaged.
2673,6,"Gender bender It's a movie that's meant for men and women, better yet young women. It was nowhere as insulting for men as captain marvel was imo. But I'm pretty sure the criticism from fans is sexist, although they may not come out and say it. But the movie was good, a great combo of emotion, comedy and action. It's a good story. They changed a few comic book origin things but that's what Disney does. They got the viewer emotionally invested. It's definitely a six but that's about it. But I definitely enjoyed my cinematic experience."
2674,8,"Great Fun I don't know why there are so many terrible reviews here. I thought this movie was a lot of fun. It had heart, action, adventure, and killer special effects. I had the pleasure of watching it in HDR and it was a stunning film to behold.It is true that Pugh stole the show. She had the best lines and was the funniest. Scarlett was fantastic as usual, and kept the Avengers flame lit throughout.I'm not sure if this strays from comic book canon or not, as I've never read the comics. But as a movie buff and MCU fan, it was a great ride.Be sure to catch the post-credit scene, as with most MCU films."
2675,5,Smarten up Marvel. This was a disappointment. Huge marvel fan but this was there worse one so far. Lost interest after 30 mins. Can't believe I'd be giving this review but in honestly black widow shouldn't of got her own title. Taskmaster ruined without a doubt. I guess to be honest it isn't the real taskmaster. Not the one I know in the comic books. Smarten up marvel studios. This won't do..
2676,8,my opinion I was watching her death scene again.. It's so hard to part with the Black Widow character.
2677,4,"I'm so disappointed I have learned to love Marvel. I expect a certain level of ""quality"" of their movies.I'm so disappointed. This movie was so generic and forgettable.Really, if they've cast Liam Neeson as the Black Widow, I'd enjoyed it more.No Red Guardian kicking ass? Really?Who's that girl that was the big villain?? I've missed it. Really, everything is so forgettable about this movie. Such a shame. It has been months waiting for a Marvel come back."
2678,9,"A Game-Changer for the MCU Truth, Meaning, Nobility, Humanity, Darkness... These are some of the words whose meanings you will find generously and proficiently, almost lovingly, applied in each scene of this unpredictably depthful movie.Cate Shortland's directorial genius has truly contributed something 'new' to the MCU.Such inspiring, symbolic, and visceral screenplay from Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer, and Ned Benson. The timing of every scene was so spot-on that even a 'fake spy family' ended up looking like the real deal. I truly felt 'betrayed' and 'angry' watching the later scenes unfold. My compliments to the writers.The accent coaches did a great job as well.Any worthy cinema fan will agree that Scarlett Johansson - who plays the titular Black Widow, aka Natasha Romanoff - has excellent acting chops, a fact uniquely highlighted in this 'superhero' movie.On that note, I feel inclined to state that without Florence Pugh - who plays Natasha's sister, Yelena Belova - this film would have found itself gravely imbalanced. She was brilliant and funny and stylish, all in one.David Harbour's Alexei ""Red Guardian"" (hate the character, love the performance) and Rachel Weisz's Melina (always been a fan of Weisz) added their own special ingredients to this heart-felt film.It was packed with some of the most 'serious film-making' tropes I have seen in connection to Marvel movies.The younger versions of Natasha and Yelena - Ever Anderson and Violet McGraw, respectively - gave creditable performances.Ray Winstone's take on Dreykov was downright diabolical. He was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him get his comeuppance at the end.Good VFX.Intense stunts - especially vehicle-related.Remarkable action and fight scenes/choreo. The 'Widows vs Natasha' fight sequence was lit - it was absolutely predatorial and unnerving.The concepts involving the 'Red Room' (from its introduction and design to its fiery end) and the 'Widows' were significant to the plot.Stellar costume design by Lisa Lovaas and Jany Temime. Natasha's white suit is perfection. The black one will always be her signature look, though.The comedic (perhaps at times dark comedy) scenes and lines were so perfectly timed - I loved every one of them.The mind-control-reversal-spray, aka 'Red Dust', was good, but I wasn't entirely convinced as to its real-world efficacy. It worked too swiftly to undo several years of ingrained programming. As I write this point, I am imagining smacking myself on the forehead. This is a Marvel movie, not a full-fledged real-life drama.That said, nearly every mind-control concept explored in this film held substance. There is much truth and historical precedent for some of the will-bending ideas that Melina shared with the others at the shockingly casual 'dinner table' scene. An all-female spy unit is not unheard of in the History books either. You won't found these particular books in your average classroom, that's for sure.The idea behind an international and coordinated ring of spies is most probably the technique that 'shadow governments' use to run the show. When it comes to this topic, your guess is as good as mine.The pro-spy technologies and innovations, especially those 'digital' facemasks, were exemplary.The relation between covert spy organizations and their reliance on ""chemically subjugated agents"" is no ordinary idea, especially judging by the literature that's already out there on the subject.Lorne Balfe's musical score only strengthened the candour and gut-wrenching emotions that Shortland wove into several frames of this deservedly award-worthy film.Gabriel Beristain's cinematography was but the cream on this already lush and delightful pie.Variety magazine wrote a piece about Johansson practically insisting that Cate Shortland direct this film. I breathe a sigh of relief that it worked, else ""Black Widow"" 2021 wouldn't have turned out to be the stuff of filmmaking dreams.I did NOT see that plot-twist coming, though. It should have been obvious, the one involving Melina and Natasha swapping 'appearances'. Directing... Shortland... Genius... On the other hand, I long suspected that Taskmaster, aka Antonia Dreykov (played by Olga Kurylenko), was Natasha's original mother. I guess reading all those Agatha Christies paid off, to some extent anyway.That post-credit scene! Nuf said. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is agent mystère indeed (shoutout to her role in ""Falcon And The Winter Soldier"" series).And oh Clint Barton (aka Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner), what did you do!?This movie is so NOT like the MCU's usual fare, and I believe that's precisely what made it stand out. It wasn't flashy, overly commercial, or prone to inspiring raucous applause from viewers. Nevertheless, it inspired goosebumps of an entirely different sort, one that you must see this film to experience.So many scenes in this movie contained palpable tension and relatable pain. The story made me feel and think about the inherent meanings integrated into several different shots.From a strictly cinematic and technical perspective, Marvel Studios ""Black Widow"" should be the company's gold standard - at least, for its roster of 'supers' without any real powers. As the movie neared its finish, all I can say is: goosebumps, goosebumps, goosebumps everywhere.I have enjoyed everything MCU over the years, but this movie takes the grand cake. ""Black Widow"" has every chance of earning Marvel Studios an Oscar nod, perhaps even a win in at least one category; if not more.This movie injected such meaning into the enduring spirit of the Human Will. It infused its core characters with the undying power and legacy of the Female Heart to survive any atrocity committed against it - and to extract justice at the opportune time.This movie also declares, in no uncertain terms, that family doesn't necessarily have to be related. It proves that there's more - oh, so much more - to family than just blood."
2679,10,"A great return for MCU on the big screen Most of you people seem not to like the movie, but I do, a lot. I also loved Captain Marvel, which you guys also hated. You need to learn how to watch movies from an entertainment perspective since most of you watch movies from the critics side of view. You're never going to actually enjoy movies if you're doing that, you care way too much.I always loved Black Widow and Scarlett Johansson and she fits very well on the MCU. Unfortunately, her 6 movie contract ended and after the events of Endgame I don't think we'll ever see her character again, and that's exactly why I love this movie so much, because it gives us an ending on her story and closure to one of the most loved characters on the entire universe.Also I'm not sure if Florence is now supposed to take her place since it seems like every original Avenger is giving the role further to someone else but I'd love to see more of her too. She did not carried the movie tho, that's still Scarlett.Also what makes the movie even greater and gives you goosebumps is the opening credits with Malia J's cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" which fits perfectly with the emotional story.10/10 I loved it so much makes me wanna buy a ticket to it and watch it again even tho I just watched it."
2680,7,"Black Widow Works Because Of The Supporting Cast When it comes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I've been here from the very beginning, excited for every film. The franchise is by no means perfect, but when you look back on every film collectively, culminating with Avengers: Endgame, you can't really do anything but praise the effort and the outcome. Ever since they announced they were making a Black Widow movie, I was honestly scratching my head as to why they would go backwards, seeing as the character had died during the events of the massive climax. Well, after a year of delays, it has now been released, but I'm still wondering that same question. Even though this film is good overall, it just feels like it should've been released about three or four years ago.Taking place in between the events of Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, Natasha Romanoff finds herself on the run from the government and is being pursued by something directly related to her past. This in turn provides the backstory for the character, which was nice but also felt like just an elaboration of things we learned about her slowly throughout the franchise. Again, I was entertained by Black Widow from start to finish, but it just kind of felt unnecessary. Where this film surprisingly shines is in the supporting cast.Scarlett Johansson has always been likeable as this character, but I honestly feel that the family dynamic between her sister and parents was the best stuff in the film. Her sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) and father Alexei (David Harbour) stole the movie every time either of them was on-screen. David Harbour is clearly just having a blast with this character and it's very fun to watch. On the other side, Florence Pugh was easily the best part of the movie for me. Her performance, along with her bond with her sister just elevated the film for me. If Black Widow was simply about Natasha confronting her past, alone, this movie would have been incredibly boring. Sadly though, it does become slightly boring at times.There were a few instances where things kind of feel like they're happening because nothing exciting is going on. It really just feels like Marvel wanted to give Scarlett Johanssen her own movie before saying goodbye to the character, but also leaving the door open for someone else to take up the Black Widow title. It's also kind of difficult to dive into the villain subplot without giving anything away, but when it's revealed who is under the Task Master outfit, I both enjoyed and hated it. It has a nice payoff but the character until that point always felt underused. Marvel has had a pretty solid track record lately with their villains, but even though a threat is present here, there never really seems to be any big stakes.Overall, I enjoyed watching Black Widow because I like the character, I like Scarlett Johansson, and I loved the family aspect, mainly a couple of notable scenes in the second half of the film. Even after this film explored her past, I still feel like we didn't quite get enough from this character before saying goodbye. On top of that, since everything else in the series seems to be building on or moving past the events of Avengers: Endgame, this movie deserved to be released during the time period it takes place in. A film like Captain Marvel jumped back far enough that it wasn't really an issue and it was a brand new character as well. This film felt like it was trying to accomplish the same thing but ultimately felt like I was sitting in the theatre around 2017. In the end, I still give this film a positive grade and recommend checking it out if you have followed the franchise until this point, but other than introducing one or two new characters that we definitely haven't seen the last of, Black Widow feels a little too distant from the currently Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it stands now."
2681,5,"Poor effort for a Marvel movie Simply put, this movie was not enjoyable. In fact it was extremely boring. Probably rate it as one of the worst marvel movies. The story was pretty rubbish. You have an opportunity to make a solo black widow movie and this is the best you can come up with? The only reason I gave this 5 stars (and that is being VERY generous) is because of Florence. Her character was enjoyable. Don't pay to see it in the Cinema. Just stream it or watch it at your friends place. Not really worth paying money for."
2682,10,"10/10, thank you for your cooperation Can't possibly overstate how much I enjoyed this movie.It has everything. Meaningful plot, well developed characters and relationships. Action packed. It's fantastically shot! Lots of congratulations to Cate Shortland who did a brilliant, brilliant job. There was meaning and reasoning behind how every frame was shot, and lit, and coloured, and I really want to say I'm grateful for that. This doesn't look like a Marvel movie, this movie has Character.Also, the soundtrack is masterfully done, the acting is superb (duh). Honestly, what more do you need?!P. S If you're a Marvel fan, there are some Easter eggs for you.P. P. S If you're a Black Widow fan, there's subtext that will make you squee with joy, that a creative team finally -finally- managed to truly grasp Natasha Romanoff's character and bring her to the bring screen. Tons of thanks to Scarlett Johansson for this, it would have never happened without her, and it wouldn't have been this amazing."
2683,4,An unnecessary movie Pointless movie Disney content with continuous bleeding the industry dry the movie industry in a horrible place at the moment.
2684,6,"Such a disappointment... Pros - Florence Pugh and David Harbor did a really good job and were easily the most entertaining parts of the movie. The end credit scene was also pretty cool.Cons - literally everything else. The villain sucked, Scarlett Johanson barely had anything to do, the movie was just boring and it dragged on. Marvel was doing pretty good with Loki so I was very exited for this movie but they blew it."
2685,8,"Don't Believe the Negativity! Not sure why so many people want to try and tear this movie down. It was great! Great action, great female empowerment, and an interesting plot. Everyone who's saying it came out too long after End Game, please remember it was delayed due to Covid. I went to see this with a male family member who is a very tough Marvel critic, and he loved it too. Go and see it for yourself. Yes, you have to suspend a little bit of reality in some of the action scenes, but that happens in all Marvel movies."
2686,7,"Not the best Marvel movie but a fun one. This movie is no Winter Soldier, but if you're looking for a fun action movie with good fights, you'll find it here, it won't rock the world but it's definitely worth giving a watch."
2687,10,"I loved it. I loved this movie. Fast paced, lots of great fighting. Funny lines. All the women are bad ass. I thought it was great. I even shed a tear watching one of the scenes. I think you should give it a go."
2688,2,"Wke Widow Didn't have high anticipations for this film & to be honest, while the films message wasn't obvious it wasn't well hidden.The film follows Black Widow who goes on a rampage to avenge some PrIvIlEgEd white man in power using other women as an army!I found the film to be poor! The runtime, which I was surprised to learn was 2hrs & 6mins, felt like over 3hrs given it's poor pacing! The treatment of male characters in the film was vile & extremely sexist! Not to mention the fact they wanted a FeMaLe directer for this film & of course used the 2017 TM Movement as a basis for the story! So low, just so low!Furthermore, the story wasn't all that & the villain was crap! I heard this film had been in production since 2004, had it been made in a time before everything went wke, this would've been a great film & to the caliber of Cat Woman released the same year!Overall, the film is poor!2/10."
2689,7,"Fun marvel action movie Well as part of the Avengers you need to know how to pose.A side story post Civil War where Natasha found her old family in order to take down the pimp. Of course, Natasha got a big advantage because she got family.As expected from a Marvel movie, the action scenes were fun to watch. All the fights were well choreographed, and the camera shots were decent and not choppy. Also, there were tons of explosion and characters got thrown around. I was amazed that Natasha was still able to walk after all the stunts she pulled. It felt kinda like fast and furious.One of the big question surrounding this movie a while ago was whether there is a reason for this movie to exist since Black Widow already died in Endgame (Endgame spoiler). And honestly, I don't think there is. The story itself was straightforward with a villain who was just a typical bad guy who wanted control the world. We got a little bit of what Budapest was about, but not enough to answer what Hawkeye was referring to in the first Avengers. The movie mostly exists as a summer blockbuster. Well it did pushed the story forward a bit with the post-credit scene (you need to watch Falcon and Winter Soldier and Endgame to understand the post-credit).The family dynamic was fun tho. David Harbour mostly played a goofy dad and enjoyed the comedy from his character. Natasha and her sister, Yelena, played wonderfully by Florence Pugh, also had funny moments and the sister dynamic was great. Even though the parents didn't get a lot of moments, Yelena had many awesome scenes. She had the best joke in the movie, which was the one about posing.Overall, I think it was still an entertaining action thriller, despite how mediocre the story was. 7.5/10."
2690,9,"Great but needed more Good movie, great story line but just expected a little more depth, little more from the past with clint. Loved the characters yelena is an amazing new character hoping they will continue with her!Ofc an scene after the movie definitely recommend to watch it."
2691,2,"Another disaster of ""subverted expectations""... Apart from a few amusing bits here and there (not one of them involving ""The Star"" of the movie), this was a very ""stale popcorn"" flick with a mediocre story and an underlining agenda showed in there in such a heavy-handed way that an illiterate butcher with raging autism would have managed to create a subtler way of telling a story about a certain Hollywood creep that everybody knew about for decades (and did nothing) until it was beneficial for a select few... but hey, you can't spell Hollywood without H-ypocrisy. Scarjo, just... keep saying what they tell you to, like a good little parrot and use those fading looks for as long as you can, because after that, millions you get paid now will be a fading dream for a mediocre actress that literally built her career on crumbling foundations - Her Beauty. They subverted our expectations alright, i was expecting a decent summer movie, nothing ""groundbreaking"" but simply fun to watch. Instead what we got here is too little, and way, WAY too f'ng late. Yeah, MCU at this point is deader than Hollywood's creativity."
2692,6,"Uhm.... not one of my favourite Marvel movies. Okay uhm, we started great but then something happened and we just got to the point where there was too little time to fit in the final conclusion to the movie. I like the Black Widow and I enjoyed the backstorie but they could have shown a bit more of her in the Red Room and how she escaped from it. They only tell you that she tried to kill the creator of the Red Room and that he is still alive and they need to go finally stop him. That is your entire plot for the movie, there is no focus on the villian until the end and no fear when you see him. He didn't appear as a villian but rahter a dying old man wanting to create a army.I enjoyed the sisters fighting alongside each other but when Red Gaurdian entered the enjoyment just went away. Red Gaurdian delivered no input into the movie, all he did was give them the location of their ""mother"" ,and he lost against Task Master. Thats all he did, nothing else that contributed to the story. A waste.I was really dissappointed when I saw who Task Master actually was and that in the end she is saved as well. They changed the gender of a perfect character to fit into a okay movie. The character could have had so much more potential. They could have made him the son of the villian and instead Natasha and her sister had to fight together to defeat him, and that he was the main villain all along.It makes me scared to think how Marvel movies are changing now and that they are moving away from the actual stories but rather changing them to fit in with our world today."
2693,10,"Black Widow did NOT disappoint!! We should have gotten this years ago. Ever since I heard the possibility of Natasha's own solo movie, I was thrilled. And knowing the release date just added to the anticipation. I know a lot of us were worried that this movie wouldn't live up to our lofty expectations, but it absolutely exceeded them!Black Widow was amusing, intense, and entertaining. It possesses its own gritty distinctiveness while appearing to blend in well with the rest of the MCU. Scarlett Johansson then delivered an outstanding performance. It truly saddens me that this will be her final appearance on the big screen as Natasha Romanoff. As for Florence Pugh, as Yelena, it was just chef's kiss. She gave her all to this charming character. I gonna love seeing Yelena more in the MCU.Not to mention Rachel Weisz and David Harbour. They were also fantastic on-screen, contributing to the family-like dynamic with Scarlett and Florence.Overall, this is a film that everyone should see. It features an excellent soundtrack, CGI, and combat sequences. For the first time, I feel like I'm finally seeing a non-objectified portrayal of Natasha."
2694,10,"The famous Black Widow is back!!! After the long wait of almost a year, we finally get to see the best Avenger get her own movie. The movie was amazing, had excellent fight scenes and we see Natasha bond with her family. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. I love that they set up Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova) for an upcoming movies or tv shows in the MCU.The movie was excellent, and I would recommend it to everyone."
2695,9,"It's okay Doubt the god from space has to take ibuprofen after a fight"" this alone is all I liked."
2696,8,"More satisfying and better than I thought I was not expecting too much from this movie but I was pleasantly surprised by how this movie turned out. After all this wait, I was very satisfied by how good this movie was. It was more dark and gritty than I thought, the action scenes were badass, and the character development for most of the characters were a lot better than I thought. Overall it was worth the wait and I loved this movie!"
2697,7,"Some strong themes; but in the end too generic for me POSITIVES:1) The opening sequence and opening credits make the film seem like it was going to be dark and gritty, which is what I was hoping for 2) The hand to hand combat scenes were very physical and hard hitting which I liked. The action scenes in general actually are pretty well done 3) I was really engaged by the emotional conflict between the four members of the ""family"" and their complicated relationships they have with each other and their pastsNEGATIVES:1) Taskmaster made no sense to me - does it ever explain how they are able to perfectly copy everyone else's moves? Also, although the identity reveal was surprising, I found Taskmaster far less intimidating after the identity reveal 2) The film suffers from a common MCU problem; it has very dark themes but they are frequently undermined by the out of place humour and jokes 3) There were elements of the script that I felt were quite badly written; either through bad scene writing, bad dialogue or unnecessary scenes just to extend the runtime."
2698,6,"Disappointing but still very good I was very excited for black widow, but that hype slowly died out as the movie became delayed time after time. Watching the movie I had high expectations as you'd believe and what the movie gave me was not it.What I really did enjoy was Florence Pugh's performance, it was brilliant and I absolutely loved it. The post credit scene got me so excited for hawkeye!!"
2699,10,"Amazing I hope you enjoyed the movie as much as I did! Good action, cool skills and stunts just amazing !!"
2700,10,"This movie is mind blowing, I love black widow. 10/10 This movie is amazing and mind blowing definitely top 3 best solo movie in MCU I loved every second of this movie the actions the family plot the jokes the CGI amazing! Black widow movie DEFINITELY deserves better rating."
2701,6,"A Little Disappointed I refrained from watching any teasers/trailers before this came out so I could be ""surprised"" I guess...I don't know, I was honestly hoping we'd get to see more of Natasha's background, her becoming. This movie had SO much potential, it had a great cast and the storyline wasn't horrible...but it could've been so much better. I feel like the writing is the problem here, they kinda let the ball drop on this one."
2702,5,Just a really long explanation as to the plot to the new Hawkeye series. Not what I'd expected. No real explanation for a lot of stuff. Just left me confused. The fact that it sort of gives away what is likely to be the plot to the new Hawkeye series is disappointing too.I've no idea what's going on with Ray Winstone's accent in this. He's supposed to be Russian but it flits from American to British to Australian and at one point he sounds South Africa.On a positive note - The Red Guardian character I thought was excellent. Would like to see more of him in the future.
2703,6,"Pugh And Harbour Were The Highlight The best part of this movie was the family aspect between Natasha, Yelena, Alexi, and Melina. But, Pugh and Harbour carried this which is sad because this is Scarlett's movie.Taskmaster was a waste, in my opinion. I'm not an avid comic book reader. My main entertainment in movies and tv shows, and I remember seeing taskmaster for the first time when I was younger and thinking, ""this guy is badass."" In the movie, they never went into depth with powers or anything and was only in 2-3 moments of an overly long movie. I would've cut maybe 5-10mins. Now, taskmaster will probably be done with.I will say that hearing that marvel music in a movie theater at the beginning really made me happy. Probably a 5/10 if not for Harbour and Pugh.Was it enjoyable? Yes. Was it really needed? No. Beside having a setup for the new Black Widow, Yelena.Enjoyment: 8/10 Overall: 7/10."
2704,2,"I'll take whiny Russians for $2000 75 minutes of whiny Russians and 30 minutes of uninspired action. I heard the word ""family"" so much that I thought I was watching F9 instead. I really hope the rest of the upcoming MCU movies are better."
2705,9,"Great action movie I know it's not good enough for all the amateur-critics writing their negative opinios here at IMDB. Well... we all know what Dirty Harry Csllahan said about opinions... Everybode I saw the movie with, really liked it and thought it was really Marvel Universe worthy. And a great way to introduse a new character. And the action was great and the actors and the special effects.We want more."
2706,9,"One of the best from MCU I absolutely loved this film, had me sat at the edge of my seat from the very start.To watch a female led film without any sexualisation of the characters, actual humour, no men coming to save the day and no unnecessary romantic relationships is something I have been waiting for and here it is!After Endgames inexplicably poor attempt at female empowerment, with their ""all women together"" fight scene, which to me just came across as pandering, I was slightly apprehensive that there would be similar moments in this film. I was pleasantly surprised to see that no moments like that existed and they just made a film about a Marvel Character and not a film about a woman Marvel Character.Scarlett Johansson yet again shows why she was made for this character and just outdoes herself, she literally makes me emotional! Florence Pugh is exceptional, again, as she is in everything she does. The pair of them together was just perfect chemistry. Then to top it off, it's literally a film about people who have no superpowers, they are just amazing fighters but their bravery matches any superhero!The two female movies we've had so far have been a woman who's a literal god and a woman who has powers that no one else can really compete with, now here we have a woman who has no powers but acts like she does, there was moments where I wanted to cry because I was finally witnessing the film I've always wanted to see.Absolutely smashed it out the park! The action is crazy good! There's a really good plot and you feel like you're finally getting to really understand Natasha as a person! As its not focused on the fact that it's a bunch of women fighting its enjoyable for everyone and even my highly critical partner liked it! I'm just glad that there's finally a Black Widow film as I'm going to miss that character so much, one of my ultimate faves!"
2707,8,A throwback to Phase 2 with one flaw The Taskmaster reveal was underwhelming. This could've been fixed easily with an end credit scene set post-FFH where Ross and Fury are storing Mysterio's equipment in a maximum security facility and in that scene we see that the Taskmaster gear had been stolen. With it looking like the MCU wants to gear up for Thunderbolts it's a real shame that Taskmaster will likely be a 1 off.
2708,6,"Underwhelming but what did I expect? Black widow ranks in the bottom tier of Marvel movies for me. The action is cool, the acting is not bad (Pugh was good) and it's just great to see Marvel back in theaters, but the movie is not special.Task master is hardly a villain and more like a brute puppet that hardly does anything the entire movie.Natasha (black widow) blew up a little girl causing her to live a terrible life with deformities and now she gets redeemed by releasing her from her fathers control? Cmon now.This movie was made for fan service since Black Widow was the only avenger (besides Barton, who's getting his own show) to not get their own show/movie. The movie gives her character a little more depth, but after sacrificing herself in Endgame, was there anything else needed to be done? The only thing this movie truly accomplished is introducing Yelena and setting up her future in the MCU."
2709,7,"MCU x Mission Impossible The Marvel Cinematic Universe meets Mission Impossible with a dash of The Amazing Spider-Man. Solid story, entertaining watch. 7.5/10Florence Pugh 👏🏾👏🏾"
2710,6,"Black Widow Guide: Positives, negatives, conclusionPositives: Solid performances overall. Although it's perhaps not Scarlett's best as Natasha. Florence Pugh's performance was worth mentioning as well, she was good in this one.Unlike most of the previous Marvel films, this one doesn't reflect the serious moments with jokes the whole time, resulting in a movie with deeper characters and more emotions. That's why I consider the second act to be the best part of the movie.Well choreographed battle scenes as expected, but they can get a bit repetitive sometimes.Negatives: It's no secret that Marvel movies are as popular as they are because of their entertainment value. And I thought this one lacks that, to keep it brief let's say that it had pacing issues.The MCU's villain problem continues, Taskmaster was well introduced in the first act but poorly handled throughout the rest of the film, and the plot twist sort of wasted the character for me. A very disappointing side villain. And the main villain was perhaps the worst part in the movie. Very generic and not interesting at all.The dialogue can be cheesy sometimes and filled with cliches, especially in the third act.Conclusion: I thought Black Widow would have served the story and the universe a lot better if it was released in 2017. With that said, I don't think the movie offers anything special. 6/10."
2711,1,"The worst of marvel What a disappointment, ive never though that i could see so bad movie from marvel. I hope marvel stop making movies from black widow. This is not a hero!"
2712,4,"Shame on you for turning the Stan Lee's creation into politics!!!! It really hurts me to say that I really hated that movie, from the start, they demolished everything MCU out of it and left only political crap!Every single action character is female. I'm a female and I want to see both males and females.As soon as the Russo's aren't in charge of the movie it's look as horrible as Wonder Woman 84. When director and production companies will get it through their brains, we are people don't want to watch political crap!!!! We just want to watch and enjoy old good action!!!! How much longer they will be producing this awful crap!! It's just waste of money and resources! Maybe it's Disney's ideas but please stop make this garbage!!!!Shame on you for turning the Stan Lee's creation into politics!!!!"
2713,8,Great Sisterhood Marvel Standalone Reminds me of James Bond and Jason Bourne combination.Impressive Cast and Directing in a very-well crafted Action Flick.I don't get the Negative Reviews considering the mostly disappointing 2021 Films Line-up. One Stars ???One of the best of the year by far.Highly Entertaining!
2714,9,A superhero movie with a family story: This is a beautiful combination I liked that and I thought it was unique. Both the story and the acting were great. I am waiting for new and unique episodes. Thanks to everyone who helped make this movie.
2715,4,"No No NO!!!! Why on earth Marvel would ruin the formula that has worked for them to get to the absolute top in the box office success? Why would they ruin the best female comics (movie) character to date?! Johansson as Black Widow was amazing in her role. I waited for this movie to erase the bad taste of the Prey birds from my conscience, and extreme disappointment is the proper phrase to describe it. Black Widow has always been a sexy version of James Bond in fantasy setting. She was sexy and incredibly smart to get the info from her enemies, and held her own in ALL of the movies prior to this one. What we've got is lousy, ""woke"" character, who clearly forgot her origins and her means of dealing with obstacles. Bad everything! Is this the beginning of the end for Avengers franchise? Seems so. I added a star for Scarlett as she's one of my favorite actresses all around."
2716,10,What a Blast! Although I am more of a DC (Snyderverse) fan - Black Widow didn't disappoint. It's as good as Captain Marvel but fun and funnier. TBH I wasn't sure about the Johansen and Pugh tandem would work out but surprisingly it did. Most of all I love that it wasn't trying too hard to be something bigger than other MCU movies - this was seamless and perfect. Also the end credits got me really excited. Thank you Marvel!To all the negative reviews and trolls - stop watching movies on your phones.
2717,7,"Fast paced, visually great, and with a good story... Right, well I am not one that gets all excited whenever Marvel puts out a new movie, given the fact that I am not particularly keen on the superhero movie genre. So the whole MCU deal is not really something that gets me worked up. Sure, I watch the superhero movies because they provide adequate entertainment and have over the top special effects, and that is about it.So of course I ended up watching ""Black Widow"" as well, as I was presented with the opportunity to watch it. I went in expecting little in terms of proper entertaining, believing it to be yet another visually astounding experiences that covers up for a shallow storyline.And I was actually genuinely entertained and surprised with the outcome of ""Black Widow"". This movie was a movie that felt like a good old fashioned fast paced action movie. Especially since there weren't superhero powers involved here, so this 2021 movie was up alongside the likes of ""Batman"" in terms of me having an interest in it.The storyline told in ""Black Widow"", as written by Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson was actually interesting and turned out to be more than just your average superhero smackdown. I liked the story told here, and it definitely added depth to the Natasha Romanoff character (played by Scarlett Johansson).Visually then you will be in for another top notch special effects galore, as with all other Marvel superhero movies. The special effects teams that worked on ""Black Widow"" definitely delivered, and then some. This movie was through the roof.The action scenes in ""Black Widow"" were fast paced and adrenaline filled, which was something that really appealed to me.""Black Widow"" does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel Weisz and a short appearance by William Hurt.I have no doubts that the 2021 movie ""Black Widow"" from director Cate Shortland is not going to please the fans of the MCU, as someone like me (not at all a fan of the superhero genre) could be more than genuinely entertained.My rating of ""Black Widow"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."
2718,1,"The movie so Zzzzzzzzzz This movie sucks to me, superhero fat and joking,supervillain woman, boried in some parts and is another marvel's trash.I don't like it 👎"
2719,6,"That wasn't taskmaster .. Everything else was perfect , some oddball edited this movie but that was ignorable . Action sequences were great & it felt good to watch a superhero movie after such a long time .The movie started seriously , it was way too exciting. Didn't expected this move from Disney,but in the midway it kinda took such a haphazrdous leap that even action scenes were edited out I noticed it . Felt really odd .As usual the antagonist ; taskmaster is portrayed like a buffon . I don't know if people do research on their own or not but taskmaster is a ruthless assassin & nah not one of Nat's kind.This is just butchering. Same thing happened with Antman & the wasp antagonist , Ghost .(Brilliant villains ruined under woke media.)One word to sum it up? Forgettable .It hurts cause black widow is an iconic mcu character first appeared on iron man 2 It could have been awesome with hints and connections but nah."
2720,4,"Worst Marvel movie yet I just saw Black Widow after more than a year of anxious waiting and looking forward to it. I have to say it is probably one of the top 3-4 DC movies. Of course since it is a Marvel movie, that is not a good thing. Neither is the movie and Thor:Dark World is no longer my least favorite Marvel movie. I have trusted Marvel and so far they always delivered until Black Widow. A lackluster movie was (in the words of Thanos) ""inevitable"".The story was weak. The actors did their best I felt but the story and many locations just did not support them. Taskmaster is one of my favorite villains but they really messed that up. Taskmaster was never in the ""comics"" costume with the cape and it is a shame because it is a cool costume. Also, no spoiler, this was not the comic Taskmaster in several ways.I envision a production meeting going something like ""Hey, let's make a new Batman movie. Yeah! Only instead of him being American, let's make him a Pacific Islander. Yeah! And instead of his parents being killed, he could be stranded from a boat wreck. Yeah! And instead of being rich, we make him an inner city drug dealer who then escapes prison. Yeah! That'll be an awesome Batman movie!"" Except of course it is absolutely NOT a Batman movie. I think the same thing happened here with Taskmaster and some other story elements. DC movies and Pre-Marvel Studios movies suffered from this and it is sad to see it finally hitting Marvel Studios.Red Guardian was awesome and funny and met expectations and the Yelena character was acceptable.What bothers me most of all is the people who will say ""people will not accept a female led superhero movie"" just as they did with WW84. It is not that at all (see how well Wonder Woman did). It is that people do not like a crummy movie whether it is male or female, white, black or asian led. Marvel, you can and should do better.Note that if you go see Black Widow, there is a scene at the absolute end of the credits (no other credit scenes) that sets up other things in the MCU."
2721,8,"Average Marvel Film Good film, Ok plot, Good actors, and Nearly perfect acting, especially of D. K. Harour as Red Guardian."
2722,8,"There is something really wrong with people their abilty to enjoy good mocvies nowadays This one of the best action films ever made. The cast is incredible, the fight choreography as good as it gets, character development on point, laugh out loud funny, jaw dropping visuals, really imposing villain and a constant rush of being hunted.And still people are pretending like they've watched an Ed Wood movie.Sorry but, get yourself checked if you're in that camp because I have the feeling that ain't healthy. Being critical is absolutely fine but looking for stuff to hate when something is this entertaining is downright unhealthy.I am not sure if any other action movie in 2021 will top this even though I am really looking forward to No Time to Die.Just bloody enjoy this spectacular movie!"
2723,1,"Didn't know WB is now doing marvel movies So Disney think they can make a terrible movie and the audience will just feel sympathy for the already dead character ?Think again Disney, this is a huge disappointment and feels nothing like a marvel movie."
2724,2,"Yeah its dreadful I think this is aimed at girls. It has all that empowerment sub text, and thats okay, I mean really okay. The trouble is the rest of the film has to entertain as well. The schmaltzy scenes between the sisters should be a great dynamic, but it just ended up as empty words, empty platitudes and empty scenes A film that did get it right was ""Cruella"" which was low on sentimentality, and it had heart.I dont know about the finer details being left out of the source material story that is ""Black Widow"" , all I did know was I was bored out of my gourd, and I switched it off after 25 minutes."
2725,5,"Marvel Phase 4 Set-Up Filler Movie Sure it says Black Widow, but with what was promised before was not present in this clunky and sometimes too-slow-burn feature. The person behind the mask for Taskmaster was a great casting choice, however they're just used as a plot device. Perhaps a lot was left on the cutting room floor. Idk. Florence Pugh clearly is this pictures saving grace. David Harbour also has some fun scenes. But that's my point, if this movie was supposed to be a BW movie then why do the supporting cast shine brighter than the lead?Here's a better version. Act I: Natasha on the run from General Ross. Only to be caught and tortured by Taskmaster, unlocking flashbacks for the audience of the red room and with a younger Yelena while they grow up. Cut to present, she wakes to find present day Yelena also bound with her & they get to share earned dialogue. Enter Ross and Co. Inadvertently letting Natasha & Yelena escape, now reunited to find the Red Room and dismantle it once and for all. Act II: flashback of Budapest with Hawkeye and Natasha. Good for a 10 minute action piece, SHOWING what happened there and concluding with the death of Dreykov. Cut to present; Yelena & Natasha search for and find Melina, only to be thwarted by Red Guardian who is protecting her and her work. Fight concludes with the sisters on top; this is the part where family exposition and family flashbacks are mildly welcome. Enter Taskmaster with bad widows beating down the door, Red Guardian stays behind to fight them off and off go Yelena, Natasha & Melina on their way to the red room. Throw a little more Ross in here for flavor, perhaps sharing an ADR dialogue with War Machine/Don Cheadle (who is against all odds forcefully working for Ross) to possibly pinpoint Romanoffs next destination. Act III: finding the red room. Revealing Dreykov isn't dead, boom, now Taskmasters torture scenes feel earned as well as their existence as a character. Melina & Yelena break off to plant bombs/save the mindwashed widows; Nastasha finds Dreykov and kills him finally after a small dialogue and brief final Budapest flashback. Melina, Yelena & Natasha meet up before the bombs go off to escape but look at that one last final battle with Taskmaster, and bringing in a brainwashed Red Guardian(sounds right doesn't it?). Taskmaster is defeated/escapes. Red Guardian is fixed. Family is United. Insert short blonde haired Natasha flying to meet up with Steve Rogers. Credits."
2726,5,Average Worst marvel movie of the lot. Should have made this a series and made Loki into a movie.
2727,10,Marvelous Great addition to marvel universe.Great cast especially Florence pugh.Recommend seeing it on big screen.
2728,10,"What more could you want? Great action, great story! The new characters introduced were good as well. It was worth the $ spent!"
2729,7,"Unnecessary The acting was solid all round, the score was also pretty good and the story was okay for the most part. The problem was the villains: Taskmaster who was marketed heavily as being the main antagonist turned out to be nothing more than a Winter Soldier knockoff with very little screen time. And the reveal of her true identity was very predictable after the Budapest flashback. The real main villain was so unimportant and uninteresting that I can't even remember his name but he was basically hiding in a flying fortress influencing world events with his spies and assassins from the shadows (which seems like a very overplayed plot point as it has already been used in The Winter Soldier with Hydra). Natasha's 'family' were a great addition, but I wish Red Guardian got an action scene where he wasn't just getting shot or beat up. There weren't really any stakes in this movie as the Red Room had supposedly been operating throughout the entire MCU and hadn't caused any real trouble. There were no heroic sacrifices or deaths of any of her 'family' which left little room for any character development that Natasha might have undergone in her own movie which is quite disappointing as this is the last time we will see her. The post-credit scene shows how unimportant this movie is in the grand scheme of the MCU when all it does is set up the Disney + Hawkeye show. If you watch the movie you will probably enjoy it but if you don't you aren't missing out on anything that is likely to affect future movies."
2730,2,"Typical marvel film As much as it is enjoyable, it's just a typical marvel movie where you knew what was going to happen. Jokes, fast paced and good action scenes. They have ruined taskmaster though but that is not surprising at all."
2731,5,"good action, pointless story We know better marvell movies than this. Act average, effects are great, action amaizing, music great. Story poor. And im sorry to say, but Scarlett Johansson could use some fitness."
2732,10,"Everything a classic Marvel fan would enjoy, yet is easily understood by newcomers After multiple delays, Marvel Studios finally delivers on their promise to bring forth the new action-packed superhero blockbuster, Black Widow! Black Widow has everything a classic Marvel fan would enjoy, yet is easily understood by viewers with no prior knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Behind all the superhero cowls is fantastic character development. Each character experiences a different emotional journey, finding themself in an extremely different emotional place compared to the beginning of the film.Black Widow serves as a prequel to Avengers: Infinity War, shining light on plot lines we had no clue occurred. The film picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War where Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run from the U. S. government. When Natasha is attacked by the iconic villain Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), she is led to confront her past. When she learns the Red Room is still functioning (kidnapping and training widows), she must team up with unlikely allies to defeat the organization once and for all.For comic book junkies there is always a worry that superhero movies will sometimes be a bore, because you already know the story so well. Black Widow abolishes this worry with multiple twists and turns that are new to comic book fans, yet are very respectful to classic superhero origins. When people think of the character Black Widow, they extremely undermine the grittiness of her backstory. Director Cate Shortland is marvelous at mixing in Natasha's dark past to boost her character development and show what drives her day today.Black Widow is one of the darkest Marvel movies to date. Throughout the film, rough and sensitive topics present themselves such as child trafficking, drug use and suicide. The film also includes multiple curse words and many different instances of intense action. Despite the gloomy tone, the film explores themes of family and reminiscence. Morals are taught to younger viewers demonstrating the message that people can change; you just need to give them a chance.I give Black Widow 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. You can stream Black Widow on Disney+ with premiere access or watch it in your local theater on July 9, 2021. Make sure to check it out!Reviewed by Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"
2733,5,"Out of Place Just off the bat, I don't like the Taskmaster reveal not because it's a woman or not like the comics I don't like it because we don't know this character, we only saw one flashback where you couldn't even really see the face, I hate how they made Red Guardian a joke, he's supposed to be the Soviet Unions Captain American but they just make him a joke when he should be awesome, Flourence Pugh was amazing every joke by her was funny, Scarlett Johansson gives an amazing performance and honestly my mane problem was the writing, the post credit scene with Val was good sets up Hawkeye and Wasn't RDJ supposed to make a cameo?"
2734,1,Can I give it a no Stat rating Worst film I have ever seen marvel put out. Scarlett J. Was done wrong by this film. For a Origins story worst thing to happen. My 2yr old could have come up with a better story line. I don't even have a 2yr old. Wow absolutely horrible.
2735,1,"Mediocore at best Morale of the movie is Men Bad, Ladies Good.Too much talking & emotion.Ray Winstone is awful in this, his russian accent is terrible.Taskmaater is just another rubbish marvel villain.Feels like this is just too little, too late."
2736,10,Loved it. I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to. The dialogue was razor sharp and the characters were excellent.Scarlett Johansson really shines along with a brilliant cast and Florence Pugh in particular is stellar.
2737,3,"""He's Making Me!"" The good news is, for the first hour and a half, Black Widow is actually a little better than the abomination I'd expected: there's some competently-handled-if-distractingly-implausible action scenes, the CGI is decent enough, and the 'girl power' nonsense is mostly kept to bearable levels until the VERY tiresome last half hour.But in a film with an overwhelmingly female cast, every single one of them is presented as either a smart and competent hero or a victim: there are no female villains, only big bad (white) men, every single one of whom is either arrogant and evil or stupid and useless. The single exception to this rule, the rather obvious diversity hire playing Mason, O-T Fagbenle, is easily the worst performance in the film, and Ray Winstone (terrible accent), William Hurt and even the Taskmaster character are wasted and disastrously underused, offering no real threat and hardly being onscreen at all.Johansson and Florence Pugh are both solid, but they have very little of any substance to work with. There's no weight to any of the emotional scenes and just about all the jokes fall flat. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour as the parents are OK but their characters' changing behaviours (and ability to construct sentences in English) make no sense. The big change made to the Taskmaster was a disappointment as well and detracted from the character.In the final analysis, it's not the very worst superhero film ever - and certainly not as bad as Captain Marvel or WandaVision - but the last half hour falls apart VERY badly, and the rest of it is a long, dull and largely underwhelming slog, with nothing you haven't seen many times before in better movies, just done quite a bit worse, and in this it bodes badly for the future of Marvel."
2738,8,spectacular plot I watched this movie and loved every scene; featuring sensitive themes such as trafficking women and turning them into killing machines and also about a dysfunctional family and its derivatives but what fascinated me the most was the fact that natasha was able to turn against the dreikov and I guarantee that this final hour plan was sensational because it's obvious that marvel studios master's balcony was the plan to end the red room.I could talk a lot about the movie but I think I've said enough to define this movie as an 8 out of 10.Now you just have to wait for the story to unfold about the new black widow and it's clear whether she's going to be a hero or a villain.
2739,5,"Russia what? Dialogue? Somehow, despite Marvel having created phenomenal movies like Endgame, Infinity War and more series this year such as Falcon and the Winter Soldier, this was unrecognisable from Marvel. The mix of comedy, humour, action and the presentation of a heartfelt past of our beloved character that I expected in this film was more than lacking. I expected to feel nostalgia and shed a few tears remembering her sacrifice in Endgame as well as laugh at the humour Marvel does a great job(usually) at subtly adding in. Yet despite the amazing action scenes which were well-coordinated, the dialogue was dry, weird and all over the place.That said, as a Russian watching, the representation of Russian culture was horrendous. On top of it, my mum's commentaries, with whom I went to watch the movie, were hilarious in their dislike. The random text that would appear as a name of an old airline written on the helicopter, the actors' attempts at speaking Russian which neither of us could understand; the translation was obviously done directly from English without a consultation with a linguist or a Russian native, which, they could have perfectly hired for max. 500 dollars or less to check. The cold-demeanour of ""Russians"", the world renown stereotypes about Russia were all there throughout the movie. All of which made the movie cringe-worthy.It's not a secret that Russia and the US don't get along, but it would've been lovely to see a good collaboration between Russians and Americans, to correct everything that had to do with the language and show a good representation. Shame Marvel didn't bother with that.As most keep mentioning, Taskmaster who is a great villain with a solid backstory, was pushed behind the stage curtains and was made into an uninteresting, worthless character, for those who don't have the knowledge a Marvel fan does. It somewhat ruined future anticipation to see the character back again in the films.On a positive note, the post-credit scene with Valentina and Yelena, set a great action in motion for the upcoming films. As for Florence Pugh, whose roles in Lady Macbeth and Midsommar was extremely well played, it was great to see her fit into the role of Yelena so much. It will be exciting to see her again.Having said this, Natasha Romanoff is a character I love and as much as I loved to see her own movie, it likely is one of the worst of Marvel."
2740,1,A joke! They make Taskmaster a woman?? Why in the hell do you change the gender of a character just to please the feminists? What a disgusting joke this movie is! Vomiting and disgusting!
2741,7,"Great Movie I really liked the movie, I was hesitant to watch it because of some reviews I saw on YouTube, some of the reviewers were harsh and really thrashed the movie. But imo it was a very good action packed movie and also had a great story."
2742,8,Surprisingly good! I did not expect much but the movie was good.The cast was perfect and good humor.
2743,10,ANOTHER GREAT MARVEL MOVIE BLACK WIDOW is another great Marvel Movie and a perfect summer popcorn movie. The cast is terrific and the back story is good. Stay for he end credits to catch another Marvel end of movie teaser!😎
2744,4,It was OK untill the prison rescue Up until the prison rescue I was enjoying it but it became ridiculous really quickly with an invincible helicopter being used as some sort of air surf board with Natasha dangling from a rope to grab her dad from prison as an avalanche kills everyone.
2745,7,"A decent tribute for a left-out marvel character... Finally a standalone movie for a nice character of MCU who kinda got a cold treatment from the MCU in Avenger movies...Great action sequences with some badass martial art stunts from the ladies...good chemistry among the family, with some wry humour and dialogues that entertain well.The story could have been more heartfelt and truer if they could have shown the trauma and real hardships the girls went through - psychological and physical upheaval that turned them into the hardcore assassins... that way audience could have connected with this character more.In the end, MCU and bigwigs acknowledging a female superhero standalone movie story is a great move..."
2746,5,"Too late for this movie! It's not a bad movie, but I was expecting more than the next Marvel movie with hopeless villains and a classic origin story. I don't give it a 1/10 rating because it's still a nice story, like other Marvel movies. We see great characters, good action and fun scenes. Overall, it's nothing special, a plain, enjoyable movie."
2747,2,"So very dissapointed. I feel like I've waited years and years for this movie! I was so eagerly anticipating my favourite Avenger having her own movie, imo second only to Melinda May in the marvel universes strong bad*** women league!I was very dissapointed with the new found powers of falling 100s of feet several times perfectly unscathed and of course left totally surprised she now has unbreakable bones and can be launched through concrete walls like a rag doll and just jump up, she's clearly a tough woman, she's not the terminator ffs. One of my main reasons for liking these stronge Marvel Women is they're mere mortal, just human.The entire plot was boring at best, totally predictable and it was blatantly obvious this was yet another forced way of ramming our screens full of robotic unfeeling women to appear woke, total disregard for content, script or entertainment! The men were weak, ridiculed and very easily overpowered, yawn! Women can be attractive, funny and kick ass whilst having heart, or did noone notice Peggy Carter, Melinda May or Daisy Johnson? I am so over this nonsense now.I can't put into words how much I was looking forward to this movie, enough to pay £20 to robbing Disney, what an epic let down. Most likely my last Marvel movie or TV show, I'm no longer entertained."
2748,6,"Writers didnt do justice to her character What was going on man. The storyline's all over the place, scattered character depth, way too fast paced. That is not how you send off your second oldest main actor. But still, Scarlett Johansson has done a magnificent job, entertaining us since the last 11 years. Thanks to her and she will be missed greatly in the mcu. Nice touch by the movie in the post credit scene.The action was terrific, the dialogues were great, the vfx were meh. A perfect middle tier movie.Can't wait to see Yelena in action in the hawkeye tv show now.Valentina Allegra de Fontaine does not look out of place in the Falcon tv show now. Let's see."
2749,5,"Could have been a FF movie... This was no Marvel movie. After such a long wait we get a FF type movie. It started off well, the intro was good and then it just turned into an orgy of superhero fighting but with no superheroes! You gotta do better...The Red Guardian was OK, had some laughs at least."
2750,9,"i liked the absence of men <3 no but literally every marvel movie is frocking focused on men frick that Couldn't care less about the bad ratings, as a marvel fan i enjoyed it a lot and imo it was a very nice ending to natasha's story, also florence pugh was amazing."
2751,7,"Badass women being badass women Good old fashioned action/spy movie fun. Easter eggs and call backs are all ingredients to continue to create the MCU magic. As much as the Marvel limited shows are wonderful, it's great to see on the big screen again."
2752,1,"Pretty bad How do I give 0 stars? Because that's what this film deserves, as it just doesn't fit in the MCU as well as I'd hoped."
2753,5,"I was bored.... It's not a bad or annoying movie.It looks all pretty and expensive, but comes off as plain and flat, in the end I was left bored..."
2754,7,"A movie where things happened... There were things that happened in this movie that will be explored in other movies/shows, and I am really excited to see where that goes. Other than that, there's not much to say. The third act was the best, but the end was... underwhelming. Not in a bad way, just... Not in the way that I would've liked.It's difficult, because, as you hopefully know by now, Natasha is not alive anymore. I truthfully don't even know why they made this movie to begin with. Scarlett Johansson was great as Black Widow, but Florence Pugh outshined her. Rachel Weisz was in the movie. David Harbor was kinda funny, but also kinda annoying at times, which was probably the point.But yeah. I feel like this film should've been released after Civil War, and not after Endgame. Knowing what happens in Endgame, it's kinda difficult to be on edge or even be concerned for the character.Either way, I really liked the film. It was somewhat predictable, but the third act had some surprises. Visuals were, at times, a bit wonky, but overall very good. I am a simp for Marvel in general, so I'll get behind most of what they do. Though, again, this film should've been the film released after Civil War."
2755,5,"Cares too much about its audience. The movie feels self concious about its character. Trying to prove she's worthy of the title she shares with literal gods, it relies in unrestrained bombastic action, full things blowing up or crashing (using a not so good cgi), while the old good hand to hand combat one would come to expect from this movie is both brief and lacking.In the narrative department the movie gives you scenes full of emotional dialogue (along with jokes and exposition is the only type of dialogue I've found) with no build up to back it up. Why should anyone care about or even believe this ""family"" when they've only seen it for two minutes before cutting to a car chase.These wounds just deepen with a soundtrack who knows nothing of restraint, selling scenes with regular dialogue as pivotal moments or killing the tension in otherwise good action scenes that sound the same at the beginnig, when nothing has happened yet, and at the end, when everything's going down.Wrapping up with the negatives, taksmaster is extremely underused (I don't really mind changes from it's comicbook counterpart), and the movie would benefit greatly from cutting entirely the Morocco scene (too many reasons to comment here). And don't get me started on the comments, jokes and references aimed specifically for the audience, for you to feel good because ""you got it"", taking you out of the story.To end in a positive note; Johansson, Harbour and Pugh give tremendous charisma to their characters. Red guardian's character is BRILLIANTLY constructed through subtle action and not exposition, even if he migth be too much of a comic relief for some. The movie has some really good moments."
2756,7,"I enjoyed it! But, expected more.. Natasha breaks up with the Avengers (right after Civil War), and goes on the run from the Accords, only to catch up with a piece of her past she thought no longer was a thing.... This felt more of like a ""Lunch-Time"" movie, than a Friday-Night movie. And by that I mean it's not mind-blowing.. but it's not bad. And it's certainly better than just ""good"". If you've read most Marvel comic books, then this is like one of many average side stories they make throughout the year that are a good read. A good comparison would be the ""prelude"" comics they make for the movies. People can just ignore them and they would be fine! Or they can read them, and still feel unprepared and unimpressed.Nevertheless, it has great choreographies, excellent portrayal of character emotions (both Scarlett and Florence are very good on their roles), and a premise that's a bit overblown. It feels structurally weird for a movie, somethings aren't paid off enough and just are, but it's not as bad as a Captain Marvel.. though it lacks in importance as well, and doesn't build anything on top of what we already have (specially not for Natasha). You could skip it without issues.I'm also not a fan of the treatment the Ghost character received in Ant-Man 2. Sadly, Task Master is adapted similarly. Relegated to the side, and lacking in development. Personally, I'm invested in him as a character, and I felt like another wasted character.. again.And in all, I enjoyed it! But, expected more."
2757,10,"Don't expect Ragnorak, and you'll be happy Natasha isn't an invincible God/superhero. So don't expect Ragnorak or Infinity War part 2.Personally thought this was faultless for what it is- a brilliant blockbuster adventure, female leads without being too overtly ""girl power"", with a decent Origin story.Great Marvel film. Great quasi Bond film."
2758,10,"Wonderful I loved this Movie, good new background information and finally the history of Black Widow I tried to not spoil the movie :)"
2759,1,Horrible waste of time Rather start doing drugs thank waste a part of your life to watch this.
2760,10,"Perfect I went into it thinking it would be average, never was an action fan to begin with, but this movie surprised me. Not only was the story, direction and cinematography perfect (as it always is with these high budget marvel movies), this movie had a certain soul to it that you don't usually see in marvel movies. It also shows a part of Natasha romanoff that we've never seen before, perfect tribute to the character. Loved it."
2761,2,"Anticlimactic and pointless Why was this film even made?A ""minor"" character (sorry, look at her total screen time, a minor character) in a prequel when you already know what happens?Nothing was added to the Marvel storyline through this film, and it sets up....a Hawkeye centered film? Oh great, just what everyone was asking for...."
2762,4,"Black Widow shouldn't be the most boring part of a movie called Black Widow I think this movie would have been slightly better if Natasha Romanoff wasn't in the movie at all and Florence Pugh was the main character, because she was the only character of any interest in the movie, followed by a hammy performance by David Harbour. Rachel Weisz and Scarlett Johansson seemed to be sleep-walking through the movie, Scarlett may have checked out of these MCU movies a long time ago. It's a bit sad really, she has been hanging out with these weirdos for such a long time, and finally gets a chance to headline her own movie and gets the shortest end of the stick and ends up the least interesting part of her own movie.I don't know or care about what or who the Taskmaster is or was and how they changed it for the movie doesn't matter to me in the slightest, it was just a henchman in this action movie.The most baffling part of this movie was that there are multiple scenes where we are supposed to wonder ""Oh no, guys, how is Black Widow going to survive"" when the world fully knows she survives the movie. Give those ""dont-know-whether-they'll-live-or-die"" nailbiters to the rest of the family, maybe it would've been slightly more interesting.Seriously, I found myself totally uninvested by the end of the first act and the movie never really redeems itself in any way. My rating of 4/10 feels more lenient than this movie deserves.I was so sure David Harbour's character would die or Rachel Weisz's character would be the villain or something, but noooooo... nothing interesting happens at all. No humor, no style to offset the boring plot and cookie-cutter action."
2763,8,Pugh nailed it!! I love the way its all connecting.. Red Guardian is fun.Surprise to Natasha from a collateral damage is awesome..
2764,8,"Pleasantly Surprised I don't quite understand the hate the movie is getting. Too many people expected full comic book accuracy with Taskmaster, which would have been hard to accomplish and harder to fit in the story they were trying to tell. I understand the disappointment from fans who expected that full Taskmaster story, but do not think it means that this movie was a flop. Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense. At least make it clear the shows are a must watch if you are going to make them necessary to understand certain things. Overall a great movie."
2765,10,Always great Just what was needed when you have to isolate.....
2766,1,"Do not watch at any stake..... Where to start???? Very cheap story,bad acting,cant understand other people reviews ,especially about Florence acting,she have so stubborn face exprecions,anoying voice overal. Sarcasm all the time through the movie and not funny at all in any moment. To much talking and almost none action. Avoid this at any stake,dont waste money in cinema."
2767,8,"Satisfy/Upset Comic Fans I saw ""Black Widow"", Scarlett Johansson-JoJo Rabbit, We Bought a Zoo; Florence Pugh-Fighting With My Family, The Commuter; David Harbour-Hellboy_2019, The Equalizer; Rachel Weisz-The Bourne Legacy, The Deep Blue Sea; Ray Winstone-Cats, Point Break_2015 and Olga Kurylenko-Johnny English Strikes Again, Quantum of Solace.This is Scarlett's first appearance as the Black Widow as the star of her own movie-which is a little surprising since she died in the Avengers:Endgame-but, this one takes place between Captain America:Civil War & Avengers:Endgame. It also covers Scarlett growing up with Florence as her sister and David and Rachel as her parents. Ray plays the villain that is trying to mind control the world-yep, that's what I said-and Olga is his chief of security. You get to see a villain from the comics called TaskMaster. Scarlett learns secrets along the way that changes the way she thought things were her whole life. There are lots of action scenes to satisfy comic fans-like me-and some things that may make some comic fans upset. Sometimes things are changed in the movies from the source material that ruffles feathers but as long as the story is good, it doesn't bother me that much. There is a cameo near the end-of someone from the Marvel tv series-and there is a scene after the end credits so don't leave too early.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes.I really liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
2768,4,"Uuuuuuirrrrrrrrggghhhhh I don't watch all these marvel films. I've seen probably 5 of them. Only seen the first avengers, one of the Captain America films. Iron Man 1 & 2, Venom... I think that's it. So maybe, if I had seen more of them, I'd appreciate this more but honestly, they all feel exactly the same. Same formula, same action, same ""humour"". I don't get the appeal really and this was no different. Does anyone actually care about this story or these characters? I thought it might be a pretty good James bond type adventure or something but it's just the same old turd. Obviously I don't know the characters well because I don't read comics or obsessively watch all these films but I'm struggling to see why anyone would want to watch 50 films that are all the same. I've seen 5 of them and they're all the same so really, what's the appeal? Is nobody else getting bored of this marvel formula yet?"
2769,10,"Fffing liars whoever are reviewing. It is an absolute blast of a Marvel movie. This movie delivers in every aspect from screenplay to cinematography and action.Movie doesn't over do it. It says a stry which is a true marvel kind of story.I loved it. After watching Falcon and the Loki, this is absouletly best. Do not listen to haters who are rating it 1 and below 5. They are pigs of DC. F them. You watch it and you enjoy it."
2770,5,So much more could have been done The movie felt kind of empty like it felt short and lacked a plot.
2771,9,"Good Spy Action Movie Love you ScarJo, the Black Widow. This is a good sendoff to oblivion. You deserved better, but also you're GOAT."
2772,7,"Torn. I liked it but it didn't wow me in the way I hoped. I'm so torn by this movie. I mean, I liked it. It was so nice to be in the movies watching an MCU film again but it didn't wow me or give me goosebumps in the same way previous MCU films/ tv series have. I really wanted to form an emotional connection with Natasha and it was hard to- but maybe it's meant to be hard because that's how she was raised and trained?! Maybe it's my internalised misogyny that is making me feel disappointed in another of MCU's female led movies or they're just not doing the female characters justice. I didn't feel this way about WandaVision though- that was outstanding. Florence Pugh was phenomenal- so excited that she's going to be in the MCU universe. I'm still convincing myself that Black Widow isn't dead though. Here's hoping. Overall, it was enjoyable but I think after the successful WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki, this had big boots to fill and it just didn't quite do it for me."
2773,8,"The Hit and Miss So with this movie they did a couple things very poorly. One of the things they did is they made the whole movie bleak, and I mean that literally, from start to finish this word that keeps running through my head is ""dystopian"". And I understand they wanted to give it this atmosphere of helplessness, but what happened instead is it translated as a miserable time the entire movie.The other thing that really bothered me is they had this kind of broken humor where it never quite hit the mark, and again I think they were going for a family that wasn't a real family thing, but it just came off as bland and fell flat.Having said that, there was something very real about the way they presented the lives of spies where they would just have to pack up and leave in an instant. And an authenticity to the fact that afterward their entire family kind of fell apart without a sense of home.I don't think this went far enough into the avengers side of the movie and too far into a past that didn't really play correctly in this particular universe.8/10 great acting, great directing, the plot was just very hit and miss for me."
2774,9,outlook positive Poor quality of Effects in the final scene. Very nice except it's a little slow And it's a fun and action-packed movie.
2775,10,Baz Natasha my favorite caracters one but this film is not very good.i love it so definitly.its problem to late in vision.
2776,4,"So hilariously bad, it's almost good It's rather funny that motion picture producers take some things literally. I mean, Black Widows aren't supposed to be black, they are Russian girls after all.Disney diversity standards have ruined yet another movie."
2777,10,"Read my reviews. Marvel is back !! Made me cry. This movie made me cry not because of any sad scenes but because of it made me see black widow as a person I knew for so long and made me miss her even more now,This movie is not for casual fans it's for people who love her and I mean Natasha not scarlet Johansson."
2778,7,"Great acting, cast and action scenes, but the plot and villain were weak. Heavier on the 'family' drama and emotional side than other superhero movies, but it was very well done with great acting and a great cast. The plot was pretty much as expected, although it did have a few surprises, and the iconic characters were really brought to life in the fast paced, exciting and destructive action scenes. The special effects were good in the small scale but they were pretty weak in the large and it didn't really feel like it had the grandness of the other Marvel movies. The humour was ok, although mostly felt forced and the main villain wasn't anything special, but overall, it was good."
2779,5,"Average. Overhyped. 'Blackwidow' is an average film with a plot of a generic action flick that can be guessed by a ten year old who has watched enough big budget films.Unlike expectations the film shows nothing about how Romanoff became blackwidow. Instead it portrays her as one among many of ""widows"" trained by a special division which is pretty much protrayed as a russian hydra. This just takes out the speciality of the character. Any of the widows could've been an avenger.Besides being a standalone film for the spy character there is no action scenes or fight sequences that is impressive nor memorable. ""Taskmaster"" and ""Alexei"" both being captain america like characters never had a decent fight scene even after both were head on colliding near climax. The film drags at times that it is so boring to even watch Romanoff had been portrayed as a strong character powerful enough to bring down an empire with her cunning attitude and combat prowess in other films while this is worse than other female centric spy films. ""SALT"" would've been a better watch.MCU post Endgame was uninteresting due to lack of Tony and Steve yet managed to surprise fans with Falcon&Wintersoldier and Loki.This film unlike the others is boring, unexciting and serves as a forced film acting as just a filler for Romanoff between Civil War and Infinity War.This should've been made before Infinity War or soon after End Game atleast. The character is no more interesting nor relevant.Plot is generic. Direction is average. Fight scenes are just unimpressive and action scenes are filled in with CGI overflow which is pathetic for a standalone film of an Avenger.Bad film MCU. Stick to good plots."
2780,7,"Stephen Dorff is wrong. Scarlett Johansson has nothing to be embarrassed about, but it was just an action flick. With Black Widow going solo I was not expecting to see something that looked like a Superhero movie. What we get here is an action flick on a higher scale. Not as High as say Captain America: The Winter soldier, but that's the level they were reaching for, but never get thereThat has a lot to do with the fact that Black Widow could have done some more action in the action film. In films with other Avengers Black Widow gives a superb action sequence. Some of the sequences here felt incomplete. Too much cutting in-between the action and the talking (not something you want to do in an action film really).There was a lot of talking. A lot of understandable talking, yes, but at the same time I wanted to see Red Guardian do some more Captain America stuff.Not sure how I feel about Florence Pugh. Good as a fellow Black Window. Funny when it comes to poking fun of Natasha Romanoff and her being an Avenger, but the chemistry between Pugh and Johansson did not hold the movie as needed.Ray Winstone's Villainy is a step back (maybe purposely as the movie takes place in the past). Not his fault for his portrayal of General Dreykov, it just that once Marvel reached perfection with Thanos its hard to watch them turn back to only the hero's journey matters and not the foil they face.I was waiting for the Task Master to make it onto the silver screen for a minute. Not what I was expecting but not fully disappointed. Just left me wanting more.I want to point out that this movie is one step up from Captain Marvel. I know it should mean nothing, but there was a very little thing in Black Widow that I was expecting Captain Marvel to be all about.I have to admit though I did love this action movie, but as a Marvel movie I just felt it was missing a lot of parts. It was cool when they referenced things talked about in other movies but then you had things in the movie that needed to be addressed more.Overall, I thought Scarlett Johansson showed a mastery of the character. It may not look like it but she was everything I expected from Black Widow. Plus we got to see her origin played out,and as such it was a fond farewell to the character."
2781,3,dumb and dissapointing Just a cashgrab without any substance. Dumb plot just random fight scenes that have no weight or point to them.
2782,4,Least intelligent movie from Disney yet Garbage story & the stupidest re-write of the black widow origin imaginable.
2783,4,"A filler film Like a filler episode in the TV series this is a filler film from Marvel. It started with a bang but ended like a typical genre film. So many clichéd scenes and the PC Hollywood culture was the final nail in the coffin. All badass roles are of women, Taskmaster was my favourite part of this film but they even had to cast a female in that role. The villain (poorly characterised) is a man, and the joker dad, The Red Guardian is a man.Lazy writing, not what you expect from a Marvel film."
2784,1,"You could've done more Black Widow had so much potential and I was genuinely rooting for it, yet somewhere between her debut in Iron Man 2 (2010) and the delayed release of her origin story due to Covid, that potential to me seems like the ever promising high school basketball player who scouts raved about and told you that you had to check out, but for some reason or another, never got to see their name up in lights.The picture opens in 1995 as a young Natasha and her sister Yelena living in Ohio with their ""parents"" David Harbour and Rachel Weisz, as undercover Russian operatives. Which just screams The Americans (FX show) to me.The plot and direction were lazy, and could've focused on a much more character driven direction, exploring Natasha struggling between the family that never was and the demons of her past. Yet between the cheap MCU comedy (I hope you're sitting up straight Natasha), the overuse of CGI in what's become known as the predictable Marvel movie climatic ending, the terrible use of a character with SO much potential in Taskmaster, the all to many coincidences (parachute just being in front of Natasha when Yelena blows up the planes engine to name one) and Ray Winston as a cockney Russian who severely, severely underwhelmed, it feels like an attempted money grab from Kevin Feige and co which lures us in for one last glimpse of Scarlett Johansen as Natasha Romaoff just to introduce a couple of new characters who we'll undoubtedly see somewhere down the line (yawn). But as long as they make their profit, who cares if the story is actually good, right?This could've been the ultimate Marvel spy movie, and at is core would've been a family reconnecting to take down the machine that created them. Instead, we got a bad James Bond of the 70's spoof which will ultimately go down in MCU history alongside the first two Thor films and 2008's The Incredible Hulk as films that are just kind of...there.If this film came out after Civil War, there could've been some salvation. However, as an audience ultimately knowing Natasha's fate, this film serves no purpose being released in 2021 other then the ones I stated earlier ($$$ & Florence Pugh) and doesn't affect the timeline whatsoever and could've easily not have been released.I just can't escape the feeling that they should've done more for Scarlett Johansen in her way to late origin story of a character she's been playing for over a decade. The correct idea could've been to give the Black Widow a phase 4 series like The Falcon & The Winter Solider and perhaps make Loki his own genre bending film, which would've been so much more captivating. All we got was a thrown together mess with a not even worth it villain (say hi to the Malekith for me, Taskmaster) with a brief shining light that was Florence Pugh.You could've done more.Thanks for 2 and a quarter hours of my life I'll never get back."
2785,6,Underwhelming to say the least Taskmaster character is butchered in this movie.. Such an amazing villain destroyed only to enter some emotions in the movie.. like dude i am so disappointed.. I would've given 10 stars if taskmaster was ruthless like in the comics.. Movie is underwhelming.. Jump cuts are very noticeable in several places.. story is mediocre to say the least.. action scenes average.. overall very dissapointed.
2786,10,"Good return I thought it was a solid return to the big screen for marvel movies, a great send off film for Scarlett Johansson and a great introduction for Florence Pugh for the future of the MCU.Overall solid film and well worth a watch (Definitely wasn't worth the year and 4 month delay tho😬)"
2787,7,"Florence Pugh stole the whole movie #BlackWidow was a great film overall, but they butchered Taskmaster and the movie itself still should have come out a decade ago; other than that, it was cool.Florence Pugh stole the whole movie, and I can't wait to see her again."
2788,5,"Tedious Pointless filler, wasted £20 on this and spent most of the movie waiting for the end credits in the hope that something interesting would happen.Explosions, and dated action punctuated log drawn out conversations that added nothing to the movie filled with boring dialogue. There's about enough plot here for a 20 minute cartoon and the rest is mediocre padding.If this wasn't a marvel movie most people would have switched it off halfway through, let's stop pretending otherwise."
2789,10,. I didn't expect if taskmaster was doesn't important person.
2790,7,"Hit and Miss, but Marginally More Hit Black Widow is a surprisingly hard movie for me to judge, not the least because it's the first Marvel movie we've had in two years now. I can't say I had particularly high expectations, nor can I say I was particularly disappointed. At the end of the day it's still a Marvel movie, and even the worst of them are hugely enjoyable experiences. Thankfully Black Widow, despite its problems, doesn't hit too close to the likes of Iron Man 3. It's still a thoroughly entertaining movie full of thrilling action, hilarious comedy (especially if you like Marvel's style), enthralling characters, fantastic performances, and reasonably dark subtext. In some ways it feels like a Phase 2 movie, but in others you can tell they're starting to attempt new things. I'm not familiar with Cate Shortland, but it's clear to see where her input ended and the Marvel machine's second unit took over, and her slower moments were absolutely the film's strongest points. The over-reliance on CGI and superhuman physics meant that as entertaining as the action was, it was just more generic Marvel affair that had no real consideration for characters' power levels or fighting styles (Taskmaster is all about mirroring moves, and yet we don't see any of this actually on display, for instance). I give Black Widow a very conflicted 7/10, with a high chance of it falling as it gets rewatched."
2791,10,"Loved It This movie was fun & entertaining! Action, Comedy, Drama, etc. Typical great Marvel movie. Long live Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow ! If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy this movie."
2792,10,"Fabulous Just fantastic, fabulous, mind blowing. Scarlet is too good. Deserve an Oscar."
2793,6,What you expected? David Harbour is only good thing in this movie. Movie is boring and predictable.
2794,9,"Better then Wonder Woman 1984 !! Just finished watching the Marvel's Black Widow. Black Widow shows the story of one of our favourite character from MCU our beloved Black Widow. This movie answers almost all the question we earlier had about Natasha's character. We finally got to know the origin of Black Widow, we now know Clint and Nat were hiding in a small place in Budapest for two days & now we know what Red Room is.Talking about the merits and demerits of this movie, here I would clearly like to mention that I loved this movie a lot more then Wonder Woman 1984. I was already emotionally attached with the character of Black Widow, and this movie introduced us with her second family. Few may find the emotional portion of the movie a little low but for me it was beautiful. The action scenes and its cinematography is top notch and the background music gives it more life. The CGI of the movie matches the level MCU has made for themselves. Scarlet Johanson is so perfect as Black Widow and we are going to miss her a lot as Black Widow. Florence Pugh as Yelena is so perfect hats off to the casting directors. It will be a delight to see Florence portraying Yelena and how she fits the shoe of Natasha. David Harbour as Alexi is so convincing that he makes us believe this funny character to be the nemesis of Captain America.Talking about the demerit of the movie, the antagonist of the movie isn't as frightening as he should have. I was personally hoping Taskmaster to be more dangerous.This is a treat from MCU to its fans, and its sure MCU's fans aren't going to miss this tribute to Natasha Romanoff.4/5**"
2795,10,OMG Thank U Marvel Universe Well done tying to next Marvel series. Note: V easy to be critic behind keyboard. V difficult to be creator.
2796,4,Thought so much but the taskmaster part ruined this movie It was a good movie good fight sequence and CGI.was good David harbour and flourence was so good in this movie Scarlett Johansson was good too Needed a good story What was that taskmaster reveal one of the greatest character in marvel and they ruined it they don't need to change every male character in female first marvell was changed into female now taskmaster was excited to see him marvel ruined it taskmaster is gone.
2797,7,"Very well crafted MCU flick - don't believe the naysayers. Black Widow, is a very good and also very well made movie. I enjoyed it in its entirety. Especially after such a long time without movies.Black Widow is excellently crafted, so I can't really understand why this movie can be rated worse than 5.Here's my summary:Plot: 8/10 The plot was harmonious. Focused on the family and from Elena's point of view even very stirring and touching. Deductions for the really mediocre antagonist and his rather poor motivation. Taskmaster had a brilliant opening. I liked it very much.The surprises and comedy was great too.6/10 Editing and Cinematography: Basic solid camera work. Fights felt intense. Action and CGI was very okay.9/10 Score: Loved it. Very well done.8/10 Surprise and Fandom: A perfect ending for Natasha, Endgame certainly didn't have it, but the final scene makes up for a lot.7/10 Dialogue: Sometimes just okay, rarely flat, very often funny and great warm conversations.9/10 Extra: Budapest and Hawkeye - check Thunderbolds in the buildup - check Taskmaster copies fighting styles of various Avengers - check Red Guardian and Cap America Rivalry - check Pigs who you can talk to - checkAll in all, a very good 8.5 out of 10."
2798,7,"Jensen Ackles The film is legendary, frankly Carrey, personal in terms of drama, fantasy and reality, and the film is based on the basis of futuristic technology, and the representation of the crew was beautiful, especially Scarlett and David."
2799,7,Florence Pugh is a star Florence Pugh was the real star of the film. And not Scarlett......she should definitely take her place as a new cooler funnier black widow in the phase 4. And that post credits was litt.
2800,10,"Great Movie In the first maybe 20-30 minutes it gave us a background of the Black widow, her sister, her family and Redeye. The one keeps wondering what if Redeye controlled the world? I think the first few scenes was perfectly fit the movie, background of the character was needed as she was introduced in Iron man and still no one knows her history. Loved the movie, loved the marvel cinematic action after waiting a very very long time. Unlike everyone else, I think TaskMaster would have absolutely a big future, her consciousness was needed to see her in the future. Keep it up, Marvel."
2801,3,disappiontment Come on marvel you can do better than that?I hate everything about it black widow what her strength?? Karate ?She's not good enough for avengers?I watched and try to give it ashot but the story is boring.
2802,7,"Marvel-lous Fighting Sequences Another marvel gig with great stunts, fast paced fighting sequences just not with a strong gripping plot. I mostly enjoyed this movie cuz of the fights and CGI rendering.. though CGI rendering at some end parts of the movie looked obviously fake. Performances were not bad though with Scarlet doing her usual Avengers stuff but I think over all performance goes to Pugh, she did great with her accents especially. Storywise I wasn't really impressed, guess the trailer made me expect more and felt a bit disappointed at the end. Anyways not a bad movie to enjoy my Friday night with and kinda recommend it."
2803,8,"Great music and great acting but a meh storyline Apart from the movie having minor cliche plots in between, I really think it personally gave me a closure of watching Black widow one last time.The cliché part's including- ""I know you're still in there"" or ""I wish i could have helped you"" were kind of annoying...I mean, you could have totally done better than that!?Apart from that- the BGM was awesome! Acting was amazing! The fact that we got to know more about Natasha Romanoff was great! MCU making fun of themselves at some points was funny!And yes, agreeing with the other reviews, Taskmaster was done wrong...like the plot twist was good but it was somewhat hurtful to watch a great character go to waste like that.It's a 7/10 movie, but I'll slide +1 more because of that intriguing end-credits scene, totally looking forward for the future of MCU!"
2804,10,"UNBELIEVABLE I came into this movie with expectations slightly high, but definitely not huge. I left the theater absolutely amused. From beginning to end to the post credit scene this movie did not come close to disappointment."
2805,6,"It could have done better The first 1/3 of the film was quite great and intense. Then it went down real quick...it could have been written better. What I expect is more origin story of Natasha, how she became who she is now. How Barton helped her and what exactly happened in Budapest, since they kept bringing up in previous films. Yet....it was just a quick memory of a mission and that's all. What a shame and what a waste. The fighting scene was good, just another shame that we couldn't see more fighting scenes from Taskmaster. She barely showed up, pretty much all her fighting scenes were seen already in the trailer.....really a huge disappointment....it could have been much better if they can just stick to Natasha's origin story rather than forcing to build a story between Civil War and Infinity War."
2806,10,"Everything I'd hoped for Finally! This has been my most fervently anticipated movie of the past 2 years, which could have handicapped it (high expectations can lead to disappointment). This movie, however, was everything I wanted, plus! Great storytelling, great action, great offbeat (or should I say on beat) humour. All the cast were on point. Welcome, Romanoffs, to the Avenger family! Great international locations and crews. I can't say enough about how good this movie was. Unsurprisingly, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10 and am so happy that movies of this caliber can be seen, once again, on the big screen! {Action, Adventure, Superheroes}"
2807,5,total anticlimax after years of hype They just cooked this one too long ...that the dist turned out too be dry and chewy... action bits were fine...but it didnt really feel like an marvel avenger movie... expectations and the weird accents didnt really help this one.A lot of things went wrong with this one including the release.this post civil war timeline didnt really was that satisfying.
2808,5,Begining This movie should be in begining If all avengers movies like Thor or Iron man not after the avengers movie. That to bad.
2809,3,What a waste of such great actors ! Never thought this movie would be this boring. Action sequences are pretty bad. Also you don't feel anything towards the characters. Could have been an amazing action movie.
2810,5,Not impressed 😔😪 There was a lot of expections.. It didn't worked out for me. Only best thing about movie was end credit scene.
2811,8,Marvel does it again. They haven't lost a steep. It's gonna be an exciting second half of 2021. What a great beginning.
2812,2,"Boooored I am so over disney, marvel, star wars and the rest of it! This movie only strengthens that. I used to like black widow, she was so badass, this is boring beyond understanding. The characters has no depth, the story and dialogue are really bad. The weird origin/family story feels completely misplaced. Weisz and Winstone try their best and they are really the only good things in this mess.Whatever they wanted to say with this, they missed by a mile. And...the not so subtle white men are idiots or evil and women are superior, I am so over it."
2813,5,Meh! All the hipe for nothing. This is by far worst project from marvel.
2814,6,"G I Johansson For me this is the weakest entry in the Marvel franchise yet. Some really silly parts, even for a comic book movie and the last quarter was straight out of GI Joe. It's started off quite good and it would have worked much better as a Disney + series than a movie. If they'd decided to do a Loki movie with this budget instead, it would be incredible as I feel this character does not warrant their own stand alone movie. 2hrs of popcorn entertainment, but not worthy of the past 5 MCU entries."
2815,5,"Absolutely no chemistry There is absolutely zero chemistry between characters. Most of the scenes were awkward and weird. Very typical,no originality whatsoever."
2816,7,"Mixed feelings I had mixed feelings, this t an ordinary movie, like seriously marvel. You gave a funeral of super hero character that why??? No proper story of this awsome character??Let's review this movieStory 5/10 Action 7/10(too much unwanted actions ) Comedy (7/10) Acting (7/10) Overall review (7/10)"
2817,6,"Black Widow deserved better And so is Taskmaster.Plot was meh. Action was good until the last bit...The focus wasn't even on Natasha's black widow, it was more of the black widow in general..Kinda disappointed that this is the last Scar Jo's movie as Natasha. She deserved better."
2818,6,"Quite Boring I am a massive marvel fan but I thought this film was quite boring to be honest. The fight sequences were fairly decent but I expected a lot more. I thought task master was going to be a great villain but hardly made an appearance and when they did it wasn't the best. The best part about this film was the post credit scene and a few bits of cinematography. Florence Pugh, Scarlett Johanson and David Harbour played their roles very well but it didn't make up for the bad pacing and very slow parts. Was a few parts which tried to be funny but wasn't and a couple shocks but nothing spectacular."
2819,7,DAVID HARBOUR I thought the full Movie was good but could definitely be better but I walked out the cinema thinking about the performance David harbour put out I thought it was a show stealer and was hilarious and also the opening credits gave me absolute goosebumps.
2820,10,"Better late than never Despite the film's delay (which would have been more interesting if it had been released before Infinite War), it's good. The movie brings aspects of Natasha's life before SHIELD, and finally talks about Budapest. Great performances, special effects and photography. Black Widow took a while to get a solo movie, but it was worth it."
2821,9,"A great farewell to a great character! Something's really wrong with us, i guess! When MCU did movies like FFH and Captain Marvel, we argued about how these movies were just plain action, no character development and emotionally upright whatsoever. And when MCU really gave us a real backstory with stuff and emotions to relate with, we arw busy arguing about like how slow it was! It wasn't for me, MCU's Black Widow needed this so badly. A full strech dive into her character, her not being a sugarcoated sidekick - i of all person needed a movie like this!And those who are complaining that TaskMaster was done wrong.. Honestly for the Black widow movie, This Version of Taskmaster was the one Natasha needed to complete her Marvel arc... And i get why folks bash Marvel movies always for over the top Things and not so shocking twists, the reveal of the daughter has alot of plot movement than it was some random dude. Now we can get this Taskmaster becoming an antihero or an avenger even, This movie was a 9/10 for me. Marvel Cinematic World didn't disappoint again..."
2822,1,"Bad Acting, No heart, pointless, Bad CGI, No Action, Taskmaster wasted Definitely I'm going with 1/10 here! Thought this movie might surprise me but it actually surprised be my being the worst. Bad characterisation of almost all characters, the third act is pure cgi mess. The worst thing is the Wasted potential of taskmaster and red guarding as some stupid mind less goof. Really really disappointed!"
2823,10,Good Marvel each time strives to deliver something different in phase 4. You can be happy with this movie.
2824,10,"The Black Widow is back. It has been two years since a new MCU movie as released, but this entry was worth the wait.I can't describe how fantastic and amazing was to see Natasha Romanoff again, Scarlett Johansson has owned this character for more than a decade, but she has always played second fiddle, or a part of a lager ensemble cast, this was her story, an intimate story, the story she deserved to tell in her own words.Once again Marvel gives us a political thriller with amazing characters, including Florence Pugh who stands out as Yelena, she owns the role in spectacular fashion.Rachel Weisz, David Harbour and Ray Winston are amazing performers given larger than life characters which they play to perfection, but this was Natasha and Yelena's movie, and the amazing Taskmaster as a villain was a great addition to the great Marvel Studios' villain pantheon.I can spend all day praising this movie, I cannot give it anything less than a perfect score.The MCU is back, In Marvel We Trust."
2825,10,Amazing Black widow is a good movie for the return to the cinema. Marvel each time strives to deliver something different in phase 4.
2826,6,"Certainly Some Great Scenes and Chemistry, but an Overall Miss The action is as great as ever, even if completely unbelievable, more so than other MCU projects. For what's supposed to be Natasha's swan song, it focuses too much on other characters and never enough on Black Widow herself. Worst of all, the film starts off with a promise to do something different, yet falls back on classic CGI to save the day. However, Florence Pugh is incredible, and there are some laugh-out-loud moments that make the film worth watching."
2827,4,"Bad The film is even weaker than Marvel's mediocre films, and the story is highly clichéd and has no complexity.""Scarlett Johansson"" was not at all up to her previous roles, the rest of the actors were not great either. The only actress who can give an acceptable score is ""Florence Pugh"".The movie had good action and another of the positive points of the movie is that it has timely humor and laughter (""Florence Pugh"").The synopsis of the film did not deserve all this expectation at all, they just wanted to ruin the good death of Natasha Romanov."
2828,3,Cheap copy of Charlie's Angels Movie Story is too flat and very poor screenplay. Second half fully took from the Charlie's Angels movie. Talented actor Mr. David Harbour character Red Guardian is total waste. Weak story plot and the Villain. Actions is unclear and the Taskmaster is useless in the movie. Every marvel fan should avoid this movie.
2829,8,"A very enjoyable film It's so good to be back in the Marvel Universe (on the big screen) after what feels like an infinity ago (pun intended).I went into this film not knowing what to expect after we all know what happens to Black Widow but it didn't disappoint. I got the vibe that the cast really enjoyed making this film with, for me, Florence Pugh the stand out out of everyone.I know Marvel fans will see this no matter what but for those new to the Universe, don't forget to wait until the end of the credits... 👀"
2830,10,"Action packed This movie has an amazing performance by the cast,great action and a fantastic dynamic."
2831,9,"GREAT STORY! NOT PUSHY!! SHOULD BE MORE BLACK WIDOW MOVIES!!! The title pretty much says it all. Black Widow is a bad-ass not because she's a woman, like they heavily relied on with Captain Marvel, but because she's A FREAKING WEAPON!!! This whole focus on gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity and making that the biggest part of their identity RUINS CHARACTERS!!! Black Widow is a freaking superhero with hyper advanced fighting skills, is incredibly smart, is flawed but learns from her mistakes, has weaknesses, and has an incredible heart... OH and she just so happens to be a woman.It's so refreshing to see that this film hit all those points flawlessly. Also Madison Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz we're INCREDIBLE!!! Great chemistry!!!A MUST SEE!!! ESPECIALLY FOR MARVEL FANS!!!"
2832,10,Action Incredible movie about family love. A movie full of lots of action.
2833,1,"omg what rubbish ! I watched half (which was hard work) hoping it would get better, it didn't."
2834,10,Action Incredible movie about family love. A movie full of lots of action.
2835,10,Loved It The legacy of Natasha Romanoff continues. She deserved the movie. It's entertaining.
2836,6,"Great Except for Mis-cast Dreykov Very fun movie but I really felt Ray Winstone was completely mis-cast for the role of Dreykov. It seemed like the actor was trying to be more of a James Gandolfini Tony Soprano than a Russian mobster. The accent and mannerisms just didn't work. Other than that, very enjoyable."
2837,5,"Live heroically and give up this childish self indulgance. The story is boring stupid and repetitive like all these movies. So im guessing the fans connect to the fantasy of being a super hero. Join the military, take up a martial art, learn how to use a weapon, go help someone.Superheros and superhero movies are stupid."
2838,7,Action A good movie but only a one time watch as it is only filled with action scenes and not much of a story line.. so if you're a action watcher fan go for it!
2839,6,"Typical Marvel.. I had higher expectations again, disappointed again. For the love of ass, stop filming her and the other asses. I know they are hot, but give it a break! The trailer was batter, again."
2840,9,"Good Movie, Wrong timing. I liked this movie. Definitely nat deserves this. All the lead cast was awesome Especially Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh. Both had great chemistry and acting was superb. Action and fight scenes were good too. The opening was definitely dark and there were many emotional moments in this film.One of the main problem with this movie was taskmaster. That twist was very lame. He should be terrifying like in the comics but I'm not happy with this version. Marvel should introduce another taskmaster in the future movies.Overall movie was great. For me it was so far the best female led superhero movie beating WW1 with slightly better story. So I think I will rank these movies as BW>WW1>CM>BOP>WW84>Catwoman>Electra> if there is one any left idk.I think Instead of Captain marvel Disney and marvel should have considered black widow to release in theaters before endgame without the end credits and worked on CM movie to be a better version than what we saw in theaters.Still I am satisfied with this movie as it gives our nat aka black widow a perfect ending to her story and the respect that she deserves. I am really gonna miss Scarlett Johansson as black widow. 1 woman in a group of 6 avengers. She was amazing. If we could get to see some more of her flashbacks in some upcoming MCU projects than it would be great.Just want to say I am happy that this happened."
2841,1,"Terrible end for Black Widow, but it shows what MCU wanted her to represent Their ""dad"" gets hit about a thousand times and has to apologize about as many, yet their ""mom"" is conveniently forgiven for all her evils surprisingly quick. Similarly, when bulky dudes fight other dudes - it's a realistic fight where both sides land a punch - but when those same big guys fight the women - conveniently they can't land a single punch no more. Odd, eh?Are people still not rolling their eyes or has this become some form of weird Hollywood porn by now. All men - bad, weak or comedic relief. All wAhMen - strong, smart, ruthless yet oddly also compassionate when the script wants them to look good. This is pathetic. How many ""men are bad"" movies like this do you plan on doing? Pretty sure your target audience has died of Toxoplasmosis by now.Plus I never liked terrible cliches, bad russian dialects, and anti-men agendas, and even still I wanted this to be a good and successful movie because Black Widow had a lot of potential and was cool in the other movies. But obviously in her own movie, you had to do the Captain Marvel thing again - because that was OH SO SUCCESSFUL. It's also clearly trying to rip off James Bond movies but fails even at that.Florence Pugh and David Harbour carried this movie, even though they didn't have much to work with."
2842,1,"Worst Marvel Movie Ever!! What the hell writers were thinking, the disappointment level cannot be explained.Taskmaster gender swap? Why? It was not at all required. Drekhov could have just hired him for a TASK!! Why make taskmaster his daughter??How his daughter age so quickly when she was just a school kid when natasha joined Shield?Totally Disappointed by Marvel this time."
2843,6,"Ughhh I've been waiting months for this movie, I must say I was very disappointed in this film, I'm big on comic book movies and I love Scarlett Johansson, but this film was lazily written. I liked the action, but the plot was rushed and it may put certain people to sleep. Come on Marvel!!!"
2844,7,Winter Soldier With Girls It's an ok 7 it's just not a 9 it lacks originality.
2845,6,"Its just ""mediocre"" There is nothing much to say about this film, never expected this from mcu. It was just mediocre cause the villain had the same motive as HYDRA. Place your agents around the world and reshape it to your own Liking according to your ideological beliefs. Sounds familiar? If not then this the same but well executed plot of Captain America The Winter Soldier. Which by the way is the best movie of MCU. I thought this movie would be like Captain America Winter Soldier but Nope!!I didnt hate this movie really, just didnt enjoy it much. There is nothing special. But i really hated one thing ""Taskmaster"" Taskmaster is a king level villain of marvel comics. He has the capabilities to take Down avengers but in this movie, not only the character is gender bended, which falls under the term ""source material inaccuracy "" which i really dont like, the character didnt get proper screen time and its extremely comic inaccurate. Its just Super lame. Thats it, just lame. The movie would be better without Taskmaster."
2846,9,Scarlett Johansson as Natasha This will let you know how amazing actress Scarlett Johansson is.
2847,3,What a poor show This film is agenda driven. What a laugh I had watching it the dads dumb mums super intelligent girls unstoppable and unfortunately a mainstream bias against males.
2848,8,More than Average Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson had a great chemistry. I think 🤔 Taskmaster will return.
2849,10,"8.5/10 Action packed , thrilling, exciting and the best marvel movie period."
2850,1,"Boring Black widow had a very strong first half, then it completely derailed. The villain was barely in the movie and was a complete waste. As a female, I love black widow and was so excited for this film. Natasha has always been my favorite superhero, in the comics and in the MCU. I've seen every marvel movie in the cinemas and was literally bouncing off my seat waiting for it to start. Was also so thrilled for the movie to have a female director, finally! But let me tell you, in all honesty I was so disappointed with this movie, and this is coming from someone who was anxiously waiting for a Black Widow movie. Way less action packed than the other MCU movies and the CGI is just meh. The plot is so predictable and sloppy, very flat storytelling. The last act doesn't even feel like something a MCU movie would have, considering how popular and good other MCU movies were. This movie could have been so much better, like the insane opening sequence seemed to imply. However, I loved the comedic and the family moments in the film and those got some good reactions out of me.This movie does not feel like a final sendoff of Natasha Romanoff or even in close attempts to complete Romanoff's story arc. Florence Pugh and David Habour give stellar performances in this movie. After some time without Marvel movies, this movie is just more of just an escapist popcorn fun and thats all. With all this in mind, the movie did atleast make me happy in wanting to watch more of Pugh's amazing future performances in the MCU. I am so excited to see Yelena in the future. Pugh definitely gained a fan. (:I hope everyone has a safe and a fun experience with finally being able to go back to the cinemas."
2851,6,"Disappointment, and a sad exit for BW/SJ I was really looking forward to a full movie focused on Black Widow/Scarlett Johansson.The movie is an ok action flick, but nothing more, and i do feel a bit of disappointment.It does seem like as soon as the main character is a woman, the story always has to have a loot more focus and time spent on feelings and relationships.Would the story have been written this way if the main character was man?The plot and ""bad guy"" was quite weak.In the last 10 minutes, i was thinking the movie was less about BW and more could be a good setup for introducing Yelena Belova as a new Avenger.What do you know, after the credits, its a setup for sure. Apparently there is a new TV series on the way."
2852,10,MCU is 🔥🔥 You can not keep away your eyes from this movie. Marvel strikes again 🔥🔥
2853,5,They ruined task master This movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting but they ruined task master.I hate it when they screw with something they didn't need to. Taking someone that was able to go toe to toe with the Avengers and turn it into what they did is just appalling.
2854,8,"Sooo good I really quite enjoyed this movie. I do not think it dragged at all unlike some other reviews I read. If anything it felt short. In fact, I paused the movie to use the bathroom and was surprised that I was already about 70-75% through the movie. Could have sworn there was still half left. I also quite liked the family dynamic between Nat and her ""family"". Especially between her and Yelena. I really bought into that bond. And speaking of Yelena, Florence Pugh is phenomenal in this. She is just so funny, charming, empathetic and kick-ass. And she truly gets some of the best lines (both funny, and emotional). I also felt the film was easy to follow along for the most part. Only one scene towards the end that I think needed to be expanded upon more. But overall I really liked the story of this film. To me, I felt like the film was exploring themes of women's rights, the patriarchy and also a touch of domestic violence but in a comic book/action way. But I really liked what they had to say and it connected with me.My only big complaint I have is that the action felt too over the top at times. Reminded me of Mission Impossible 5 in that regards. If you loved that film, great. For me...it got kind of ridiculous. It makes sense with a character like Thor who is a demi God and super powerful but Nat (besides being well trained) is just a regular human. There was numerous points where I was like ""There is no way you would get up and walk after that"". But, movie got to movie I guess. Also the Taskmaster wasn't as notable as other villains have been. It does provide good character development for Nat though. So at least that's a plus even if the character in itself is kind of forgettable.If I had to rank it somewhere on the MCU movie list, I think it would fall somewhere around 9. Might have to do some re-watches again and maybe re-rank. I feel confident in my top 5, and I feel confident that I liked it more than the majority of the MCU films out there (is this 24th one now?), not that those are bad though. But there is some potential wriggle room. Also, this is based off my first viewing too.But if you're an MCU lover, I doubt I have to convince you to watch this film anyway."
2855,6,"The MCU is running on backup nostalgia power. **There be spoilers ahead**Black Widow is the MCU's first hard 'interquel': as in it takes place firmly between Civil War and Infinity War, so it's a prequel-sequel kind of. We know what happens to Black Widow in Avengers Endgame, but hey: the more milk the merrier the spoils of Disney's MARVEL cash cow I guess.It's an entertaining film that is just fancy backstory for a character whom we KNOW is bound to die later in the timeline, so plot-armour is used in SPADES for Black Widow here; she survives countless near-death experiences, but her stormtrooper-accurate foes fail to get so much as a bullet-wound on her fingers. The supporting cast are all fine, Scar-Jo is obviously the star who keeps the whole thing together in her iconic catsuit, and she's the kind of Bond girl who would easily save James' bacon from Blofeld.Of course this film being a prequel begs the question: why didn't anyone notice the Red Room 'fortress' in the sky before now? It wasn't officially government-protected like S. H. I. E. L. D. was in The Winter Soldier (evil conspiracy from inside the primary circle of American influence) so how come Ultron didn't know about it? Was there a VPN to scramble its whereabouts? And the Russians had the Super Soldier serum duplicated via David Harbour's Russian-Captain-America archetype? Oh well: the plot plays out in the way you expect it to in a MARVEL Studios film; establishing backstory, have characters face inciting incident, and finally overcoming their own hubris to save the day (and in turn, the world).It doesn't have the exact same story beats of Thor: Ragnarok or Captain Marvel's repressed-heroes-discovering-their-inner-power-at-the-climax arcs, but rather it borrows from this film's spiritual prequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier in terms of a grander conspiracy that's resolved all too easily during the climax.The action's punchy, the characters charming and direction lively, but the script could have had more polish to it in terms of the in-world logic established by the MCU's earlier movies being self-aware in terms of continuity.Black Widow: another MARVEL movie that gets its job done, if not too much else beyond that. 3.5/5 stars. I'm still gonna have to process this movie a bit."
2856,3,"Boring I only watched half of this crap. Taskmaster is barely in the movie and the reveal was very political, bland action, acting, story and just boring. This movie is another example of why movies suck now."
2857,6,Just time pass Started with some great action ... found the story line average ... I guess I was expecting a lot from this movie ... everyone is looking old now ... need to get new blood in ... and getting a family drama in a action movie ... nah.
2858,8,"Marvel is back!! So stoked to see Marvel on the big screen again! The whole cast gave awesome performances and Pugh almost stole the show. Johannsson, Pugh, Weisz, and Harbour performed really well together.The story and plot were a lot different than past Marvel films (gave me Winter Soldier vibes) and I really liked the spy/thriller feel that the movie had, which was a nice change to non-stop action. The main arc of the movie was done very well, giving extra background to BW's past and the history of the Widows, which hasn't been touched on at all. The movie and story did a great job closing out BW's arc and providing a nice bookend to her story, but leaving the Widow line open for Pugh and others to come in (fingers crossed) and pick up the snub Glocks and Widow belt.My biggest issues were the villain(s). Dreykov was the overall villain in the film, using Taskmaster (his daughter??) to do his bidding, along with the other Widows, to begin a movement to a world where free will didn't exist. To me, Taskmaster is one of the most bad a$$ villains out there in the comics. Not that I didn't like the reveal of Dreykov's daughter as TM, but she was missing and did not play as large a part in the film as I was hoping she would as Taskmaster. It was a cool arc seeing BW get closure with her there at the end, but c'mon, you cannot promise Taskmaster and only half do it.The dialogue and CGI was all great, in Marvel fashion, and this movie was definitely worth the wait. Really hoping we get to see Pugh back at it again in future projects. Overall, a great movie and I really enjoyed it, just wish there had been more emphasis on Taskmaster and she had gotten more screen time."
2859,10,Wow This is a great action movie. Brought out things we all might not have known. I hate done if the critics views as they are stilted. This is a movie to see abs enjoy on the big screen. No more ad I don't want to add spoilers. 👍🏻
2860,3,"Another boring Marvel Female Lead Movie! Maybe because I expected too much. After watching the film, all I felt was so pointless and boring from the beginning to the post credit scene. Marvel Studios made David Harbour a clown full of jokes that aren't funny and they even made Scarlett Johansson's final Marvel film disappointing. The film was made to introduce Yelena in MCU and that's all."
2861,10,"She Got rid of Red from her Ledger Goodbye Natasha RomanoffThriller Action Adventure mixed w/ drama. Beautiful & emotional; BlackWidow is best Female led CBM ever.Solid grounded movie directed by Cate shortland. Jac Schaefer is really creative. Superb score by Lorne BalfeNed Benson & Eric Pearson did a great job.YelenaBelova, AlexeiShostakov & Melina r great addition to MCU Awesome Chemistry b/w ScarJo & Florence Pugh.Dreykov was neither bad nor a great villain & it's fine as this wasn't Superhero vs Supervillain film. Film was abt Nat's life & they delivered satisfying story.Taskmaster reveal was nice. Looking forward to the Olya Kurylenko future in MCUPost credit scene.... Nat's Sis vs Nat's Best FriendThank you ScarlettJohansson MarvelStudios Phase 4 keeps getting bigger & better."
2862,5,"Could've been much better about 3 years ago A watchable movie. Black Widow fans should be appeased, but overall not a top marvel movie. I left wondering how many lines Natasha actually had compared to the rest of the cast. Longer than it needed to be as well. Florence was the best part for sure."
2863,6,"Pugh was awesome but Marvel is slipping... This should have came out when Captain Marvel did, would have made so much more sense. Florence Pugh was great, but they ruined Taskmaster. If this is any indication of what is to come from Kevin Feige & Marvel, they have lost their edge and what made these films great. They need to go back to having creative teams that know & understand the source material, not ones that don't know anything beyond face value and think they can do a ""better job & fix things"". When you make Thor: The Dark World a better movie, you have failed. 5-1/2 stars."
2864,8,"Come to think of it, its one of the best standalone MCU films. To say 'Black Widow' could have been a better (great!) movie is not wrong. Though it deserves substantial praise for what it is - a consistently engaging, tonally different, and largely grounded film that ensures you care for its titular character despite acknowledging she no longer exists in the MCU. It is well directed and acted, all-stars giving their best, and having a singular theme running for its entire runtime - the widespread abuse against women and the scarcity of people working against it. Sure, it doesn't go all in showing the iniquity that breeds amongst us, but it does far better than what we usually expect from a typical Marvel film.The beginning, particularly, and the ending, hits the rousing notes that you feel while reading the comics devoted to the character. It all culminates nicely, bridging the timeline of Natasha Romanoff well from Civil War to Infinity War while also giving us a few likeable characters to follow ahead in MCU's next phase.I'd honestly expect a disappointing film, assuming it would feel too belated. But I am surprised as well as I am impressed by how it ends up being an overall good movie, having great rewatch value and for being far, far better than at least six MCU movies (Captain Marvel, Ant-man and the Wasp, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Thor: The Dark World, and The Incredible Hulk).Watch if you can on an IMAX screen. It will add to your experience."
2865,4,"Boring & Dragging Black Widow, easily the worst of the movies from MCU.I think I have watched all the 21 or 22 movies. But this is definitely the most boring of all.No other Avengers, but for the Black Widow.Lengthy & very dragging too."
2866,8,"A good to watch movie for Marvel fans Not so much adventures, but a good story. Red guardian is not serious kind. Expected some suspense, and little bit cameo of any other avenger. But its okay."
2867,10,The movie is spectacular Action from begging to end.Photography is amazing.Music is incredible.Actors are fantastic. We laughed with the whole cinema all the time.The only thing one can criticize is that the villain lasts not much.
2868,10,Best! I have always love black window the character and Scarlett Johansson. Been waiting for this movie. Finally I got to watch it and I have no regrets. Loved it!
2869,6,"The did Taskmaster zero justice and the rest of the movie okay I went into this movie with high hopes. I loved the mysterious backstory of Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow. That mystery is what made her so endearing and intriguing so I wasn't totally thrilled about diving into her history. That being said Marvel didn't do a terrible job with that aspect. Even though I could of done without it.However, they did a HORRIBLE job with Taskmaster. If you look at the history of MCU movies and shows the best films all one thing in common. A compelling and fearsome villain (or villains). Taskmaster was hyped as this major obstacle for Natasha to overcome in this film but was barely present in the movie. I have no problem with Marvel taking liberties with Taskmasters origin and making the character a female but the character was almost an afterthought. There was one point in the movie where Taskmaster shows up and I thought ""oh yeah, I forgot Taskmaster was in this movie"". The villain in MCU movies is often as important and sometimes more important than the main hero(s) in order to establish the overwhelming odds that the hero must overcome.Not a bad movie but not good movie either."
2870,9,"""Both of you girls have killed so many people, you make me so proud"" *** Never spoilers. I find giving away the plot to guide users juvenile*** *** Hot Take *** Pros : Was looking for a refreshing action movie. Thrilling Action. Fun acting from Rachel Wiesz.Cons : A bit rehashed. Should've come out after Civil War. Rachel's accent comes out when she hunches in the movie.Review: After a year of half-cooked, mediocre releases. This movie was honestly refreshing.I have been an avid comic reader since the nineties. I have had my share of grievances with MCU but compared to DC much less. Such as there are no mutants, no WonderMan and quicksilver died too soon, No Reed Richards, no magneto. And MCU ruined A. I. M and Mandarin in a single movie.But I digress. Great movie all around. As a comic reader i always wanted and wondered what Heli jumps and Widows signature free running would look in live-action. Amazing. Not disappointed at all. But is it worth a re-watch? Maybe. Its not groundbreaking in any shape or form.Free of any brow-beating 'Hollywood Representation agenda'.After Thoughts : Taskmaster is an AWOL shield agent in the comics. The entire shtick of Taskmaster is that he is a freelance trainer of goons for underground organizations. He learns from superheroes and teaches it to goons. For cold hard cash. Shield lets him do it so they can keep tabs on how much the underground knows.3 users voted down my post when I had only put the disclaimer ""review coming tomorrow"". Nice."
2871,9,"An excellent solo movie of marvel Everything is great From emotion to fight, this movie will blow you up But there is one problem that pull the film down, it's the villain Taskmaster has a great start. Strong, great power, but at the end, she just like trash, nothing more.To sum up, this still be a great movie, worth the wait.Finally, Nat got her perfect ending."
2872,6,"Perfectly mediocre Simply put, a typical marvel movie albeit lacking anything special."
2873,7,"Black Widow Looks at Natasha's past from small child to grown Avenger. The film takes place after 'Captain America: Civil War' and Col Ross (William Hurt) is arresting all the naughty avengers. On the run, she hears from her estranged assassin sister (Pugh) and they get together and seek out their father and mother and decide to take on the evil Dreykov (Winstone) and his Red Room.Featuring what you'd expect from a Marvel film, high emotional drama, good character mockery (Pugh refers to the 'main' Avengers in front of Natasha) and spectacular action scenes. The four main characters are all great with Johansson strong in the lead, but Pugh effortlessly stealing the film from her. Nice to see Rachel Weitz having fun and it is surely not the last time we'll see David Harbour in this role.On the downside the story is a relatively familiar one climaxing with the inevitable, but what else can you do, spectacular crash bang wallop set piece, Ray Winstone's Russian baddie strays into half awake East End villain too often and some of the lively camera work during the fight sequences sent me boss eyed.Overall though a good solid effort, lots of fun and nice that they did a full film for Black Widow. Watch out as always for the interesting post credit sequence."
2874,10,"The best marvel movie I really loved this movie and I think it tells us Natashas past, the gap between civil var and infinity war, and teases us the future of the ' Black Widow' perfectly. It is an action movie that makes you cry, what more can you expect?"
2875,8,"Not bad, but with one caveat! I enjoyed the film, and the standout performance came from Florence Pugh. It'll be interesting to see how her character plays out in the future. Only downside for me was casting Ray Winston as the Russian baddie Dreykov with perhaps the worst Russian/Cockney accent ever heard in a movie."
2876,6,Not as I expected. The movie is not too bad. I don't like it. Hope MCU will make nice movies in future. We are waiting for that.
2877,7,"They ruined Taskmaster completely I demand the film be remade asap, this retconned, and that Tony Masters be given his due. Apart from that, good action movie with a decent story."
2878,10,"Didn't Realize I Missed Natasha I think stories that are in between other set in stone stories often drop the ball (majorly), because they can't really mess with anything too much without affecting the larger picture.I also thought the time had passed that I was hyped for a Black Widow movie (to be honest, I've always been more neutral on her).Black Widow proved me wrong on both accounts.This isn't exactly an origin story, despite seeing some of Natasha's background. Instead it's more so just one individual story of Natasha's. One that lets a character we know is dead, who sacrificed herself, a moment of happiness and realization that she does in fact have family (2 even!). Honestly, this wasn't anything but a found family and sisterly bonding movie, and I'm here for it.I loved the addition of Alexi and Yelena. Her ""mother"" Melina, never quite grew on me like the others did, but I still think the actress did the part well.I've seen critics say it was released too late, and I'd disagree. I think the knowledge that despite this outing and the family message, that Black Widow dies *because* she sacrifices herself, really adds this air to it. This is the one critic commentary I can still understand. Outside of the after credit scene, this movie could have technically been released during the proper order.I've also seen it being bashed for the level of CGI. I have no idea why this is even a complaint, considering half of marvel's movies are filmed in a green screen room. Does it have a huge CGI scene at the end? Yes. Does it have more than any other Marvel movie? Absolutely not. I'd say it has some of the lesser amounts of these later phase movies.Yes, the after credit scene does also set up a future storyline. As do literally every other Marvel movie. I'm not really sure why the complaints are what they are from critics, considering it's how every Marvel movie is handled.Lastly, going back to the beginning. The intro credits reminded me of some of the older super hero movies. Kind of a Rami's Spiderman/Hulk/ Incredible Hulk mixture. It was the one thing that did feel less MCU like, but I liked it. Felt more Natasha.Anyway, long commentary short. It was a Marvel movies, it felt like a Marvel movie. If you like Marvel movies, you'll enjoy it."
2879,8,"Widow's Peak Thanks to a little thing known as the global pandemic, the release of Marvel's ""Black Widow"" was greatly delayed, meaning it's been two years since we've had a Marvel movie in theaters. For over a decade now, that kind of gap in MCU movies was unheard of (we really are spoiled aren't we?), and while the good folks at Marvel been tiding us over with a plethora of mini-series over on Disney+, fans have been chomping at the bit for the silver screen experience once again.Obviously, Black Widow was not designed to shoulder the expectations of Marvel's big return to the movies, and I think fans would be right to keep that in mind. Nonetheless, this is a great blockbuster and standalone outing for the MCU's first female superhero - one who's been long overdue to headline a movie of her own.Black Widow follows the titular hero after the events of the MCU's ""Civil War."" Already in a precarious situation, Natasha's life gets further complictaed when her distant past gets unexpectedly thrust back into her life.Black Widow was somehow more serious than I expected and more funny than I expected simultaneously. As far as Marvel movies go, this is most comparable to ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" in its tone and style. That's fitting, given that the spy thriller genre fits the character like a glove. Still, I think viewers' mileage with the plot may vary. This is due mainly to the villains, whom I found to kind of be duds that could have had greater potential. Additionally, while not an issue per se, the plotting is not overly complex or full of the twists that you might expect given the genre.Where the movie really shines is in the family dynamic that it creates for Natasha. The supporting cast that comprises this odd little unit is fantastic. Florence Pugh in particular, whose other work I have never seen before, was especially endearing and a real standout. The relationships were the best part of the movie for me. They are funny and emotional all at once, and are used to great effect to explore Natasha's past and what makes her tick. Almost since her introduction to these movies 10 years ago, the character has been talking about doing what she does to atone for the mistakes of her past, and we finally get that fleshed out in a way that makes her character arc more substantive.Coming as a surprise to very few, Marvel yet again nails the action. It's full of great set pieces and visceral hand-to-hand combat. One complaint I do have is that our heroes walk away from a couple of situations more easily than they should have, given that they are regular, non-superpowered humans in this universe; this noticeably lowered the tension for me by the end.All in all, I give ""Black Widow"" a 7.5 - it's a flawed but highly entertaining blockbuster that doesn't change the fabric of the MCU, but does finally flesh out one of its more prominent figures."
2880,6,"I expected more This was really a disappointment. Taskmaster was a lame villain, and it was way too talky. After waiting two years, it's clear that the trailer had the best parts. The acting was good, but the jokes fell flat and there wasn't nearly enough action. Marvel really did Black Widow, one of my favorite characters in their cinematic universe a double disservice; first they killed her off in Avengers: Endgame (a movie felt was too long and in parts too dull) and now this, which really had almost too many characters in it. Could have been much better."
2881,10,"Best movie to come out since 2019 Just saw it on a Thursday night early viewing. This movie is great! Don't let some of these negative reviews influence you, after reading them and seeing when they were posted they obviously never saw the movie."
2882,9,"I really liked it! This movie was good! If the pandemic didn't strike and this one launched the Phase 4 of the MCU, many of the fans would have loved it even more! But we had to wait for 1.5 years for this and that's why some fans have bitter sweet opinion about this one! We also got Loki at the same which is ruling everyone's heart right now and that has affected this as well!My biggest complaint about this movie is Taskmaster! This movie suffers the same thing as many of other MCU outings. Villian wasn't as fleshed out!Other than that, I really loved it! 9/10 for me considering it was just starting of Phase 4."
2883,7,Florence Pugh's inside jokes FTW Notable addition to MCU that lacked anything memorable. Cate Shortland tried to bring certain depth into surprising family reunion between some exciting action sequences against underwhelming villains. Pugh delivered many 'inside jokes' to help Natasha Romanoff's mission.
2884,6,"Ranked 21/24 After thor dark world ,the incredible hulk,captain marvel this comes."
2885,8,Guaranteed Entertainment Before watching this movie I'd seen some reviews of critics. And after that I hadn't much expectations from this movie. But it surprised me. This movie is way much better than I expected. Although I admitt the villains didn't leave much impact. I had really good expectations from taskmaster and they started with that character really well but didn't use it effectively in the end. It was kind of a let down. Other than that this was really good movie.
2886,6,"Ranked 22/24 Afterr thor dark world ,the incredible hulk this comes."
2887,7,"Marvel Studios Fast and Furious. ""you don't turn your back on your family.""Dominic TorettoBest action movie from MCU, and no doubt on that. Good cast, good acting, catchy dialogs.Did they changed Task Master into Deathstroke? God damn it, why even they do it?Scarlett Johansson is absolutely stunning in this role. I was missing her like a lot. Great to see her in action again. Florence Pugh was fantastic. I love Rachel Weisz. She was perfect when she suit-up. David Harbour was funny, when he said, ""Cause my girls are the toughest girls in the word"", I remembered Eleven.Overall, a treat for action movie lovers and ofcourse for MCU fans.Dom would be overjoyed."
2888,9,"It could be more entertaining but it was good though. The movie was fine to me, they should have give more screentime to taskmaster, there should be a tough fight between bw and taskmaster, but that doesn't mean movie was poor. It a good movie individually,"
2889,3,Not strong enough to be a Marvel movie The story is okay but the movie is horrible. It's like Watching a fast and furious movie totally ridiculous.
2890,8,"Another enjoyable Marvel movie It felt a little slow in places, but I enjoyed this movie and the action scenes were great. David Harbour stole the show."
2891,7,"Phase 4 is going to suck After watch 5/6 episode of Loki and black widow movie, I can say that this is the worst time to watch MCU content after first 2 Thor movies. They are not putting as much effort as before. Let's see if spiderman and Dr. Strange can help mcu maintain its standard ."
2892,9,"i love it!! Well at some point, runtime was little bit slow but it worth watching. Scarlet Johansson's performance was amazing as well as rest of cast. I love the flim."
2893,1,That's my opinion of course There where sooooo many ridiculous scenes that I was laughing almost non stop I thought that this movie is action/adventure I thing that if MARVEL will continue and make such kind of movies they should change from a action/adventure to comedy movies because black widow is one of the funniest and fiction movie they have ever made including wandavision.They spend so much money to make this disappointment of a movie at one point and after it's just sad the things they try to pass on to people as normal JUST SAD 😔 AND DISAPPOINTING.
2894,6,"Standard spy movie carried by the bond between Pugh and Johansson Black Widow is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed by Cate Shortland, the director of Lore and Berlin Syndrome.In the film, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run from the government after violating the Sokovia Accord. She goes into hiding in areas where she has lived in her past and is trained to be a super spy Black Widow. By visiting these places, she is confronted by her past and encounters old acquaintances. She crosses paths with Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), who also completed the Black Widow training. Together, they try to stop the organization behind the Black Widow training sessions, but to do so must face spies of their level and the mysterious Taskmaster.This film was Cate Shortland's first directing work of a major action film. She had even rejected the film as a director at first, but Scarlett Johansson managed to persuade her to direct the film anyway. The fact that this is her first directing work of an action film is unfortunately reflected in the quality of the film. Despite the fact that most of the action scenes are entertaining, they also come across a bit too moving and a bit juxtaposed. The last action scenes also clearly show that the actors are standing in front of a green screen and that the explosions, like many other explosions in the film, have been placed in the film with CGI.The story of the film also comes across as a standard spy movie, but here at a slow pace. In the story, unfortunately, they also choose to overshadow the drama moments with comedy. This also makes the film lose its depth. The film also has some nice links for the fans with other Marvel films, but at one point also chooses to copy other Marvel films, so that moments can come across as familiar to Marvel fans.The acting is fortunately well done by the film cast. This is Scarlett Johansson's ninth time playing the Black Widow character in the Marvel film series. Despite her character playing the lead role in this movie, she plays the role better in most other Marvel movies. Florence Pugh is best portrayed in the film. Together with Scarlett Johansson, they create a nice mutual chemistry, which comes across as the love-hate relationship between two sisters. Viewers who have siblings of their own can relate to some of the moments the two bring out together in the film. David Harbor provides most of the comedic moments in the film, but does not get much else to do in the film. Rachel Weisz also has a small role in the film, which only helps the story move forward."
2895,10,"PERFECT TRIBUTE FOR BLACK WIDOW Superb movie with lot of emotions carried throughout the movie. Scarlett performance usual than awesome. Florence pugh, David harbour rocked. A perfect marvel you can expect. The post credit scene is 😱. Well directed and crafted within the timeline of Civil war and between Infinity war."
2896,10,"Show, don't tell. If you are a fan of Natasha Romanoff, that alone should allow you to enjoy the film. Great action and emotion from all characters. But a lot of this movie is Natasha explaining her past rather then actually showing us. We don't ever get a scene of Natasha and Clint in their Budapest mission, which is something all fans would have loved to see."
2897,7,It's an awesome cgi and action and script Like Scarlett johansson and the twist of the movie.
2898,10,Dream come true Best movie I've ever seen. Best real action since the winter soldier. Finally highlighting one of the best characters in the mcu.
2899,10,Marvel is back Story won't have much importance in MCU future But every scene is amazing Scarlett Johansson is flawless David harbour has magnificent timings for jokes though his character has totally been made fun of His character could have been better.
2900,7,Good but not great Pros: + crazy ass action (sometimes gets over the top) + good camerawork + good cinematography + good music Cons:bad villian-Cliché spy/crime storya few bad dialogs.It's like the fast and furious of marvel imo.
2901,2,"Taskmaster is ruined Everything was ok in this movie until Taskmaster was revealed as a female...got too political. If Taskmaster was a male, I would have given 6 or maybe 7."
2902,5,Lack of character development Marvel should have made a TV Series of Black Widow like WandaVision.Not a movie like this.
2903,10,Masterpiece You must watch this movie. This is too good and very string story i loved it will also.
2904,5,Average Movie -Average Movie -Below average story line -Taskmaster character ruined -Acting & performance of every character is very good.
2905,5,Belongs in 2017 This one should've come out next to black panther. It's too late now.. The post credit scene made me roll my eyes.
2906,7,"Nice to see a MCU movie again...but disappointing. I will try to keep this basically spoiler-free. FIRST OF ALL, whenever you say that the current marvel film is one of the worst people get angry and I understand. I like or love every single movie that the MCU has put out including this one, but that does not change the fact that out of 24 movies this is somewhere in the 20'sScarlett and Florence do a nice job but the plot is average and the villain(s) are HORRENDOUS and forgettable.There's is no GREAT moment, and nothing shocking or unpredictable at all. An action film with ZERO SUPERHEROES. ZERO ZILCH.End credit scene is Zzzzzzz."
2907,8,"A family-focused backstory of self identity It's a shame it took Black Widow so long to get a solo film. Great performances from the entire cast with some truely amazing visuals and filming locations.As is often the case with Marvel, they can be a bit hit and miss when it comes to the treatment of their villains and Taskmaster was no exception. A great character that was really watered down and adds nothing to the film. You could replace Taskmaster with a standard Red Room Widow and the outcome of the film would remain the same.That aside it was great to see Scarlett Johansson finally get to be badass as Black Widow in her own film that definitely does the character justice."
2908,2,"Feels like a teenager's wishful thinking Everything is timed so perfectly... the length of cable is perfect from the helicopter... in reality, they could rehearse it 35 times and still have not succeeded, but in the movie, they randomly do anything and everything succeeded.And yes, the bomb would explode about 0.5 second the lady flee the scene, every single time.This movie is ok for the action to look at, but the storyline is pretty weak.Right about the movie is released, there were some people online saying it was a great movie, it was a fantastic movie. It felt a little bit like some people were paid to say that, or that some people who were related to the movie or if they own Disney stocks were saying that. If they do that, it is a betrayal to the audience.I like Iron Man a lot more."
2909,6,"Would have been good if we got to see it years ago Like someone else said on here, this felt like somewhat of an afterthought.DC came out with Wonder Woman then years later Marvel decides crap, we need a solo female movie. Yay. So much potential, so much to work with. Make a Black Widow movie. But no, we get Captain Marvel which is another review altogether.Then, thanks to Covid this movie gets delayed, then once more and finally another time which has unfortunately made this too little too late.An afterthought for such a powerful, groundbreaking character in the comics and even the MCU eventually and it's such a shame.The acting was good, the characters were awesome, CGI could have been better but it seemed so much like the MCU just had to do their due diligence and release this film.I'm so disappointed having been a Romanov fan since I was a little girl, then as a teenager and a woman growing up with the films. Scarlet has been brilliant throughout and and Romanov deserved better."
2910,8,"Great! 8.5Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger."
2911,4,"Mildly entertaining The two female leads are utterly awful on screen together. Listening to Johannsen & Pugh speak their lines was like nails on a chalkboard and only one quarter as interesting. The middle act is painful to watch and grinds the movie to a halt.The only high points is the humor David Harbor injects, and the Taskmaster character. The Taskmaster was well-done despite the deviation from his comic origins, and had some great action scenes.You'll watch this movie, then just like most of the other Marvel movies, never watch it again."
2912,7,"A Decent MCU Return I saw this film last Thursday night, and I was mostly not disappointed by the outcome. I liked how we dive a little deeper into Natasha's origins and her family. It's the film we've been waiting for for 10 years. It was cool seeing her family and their traits. One downside is that even if it's a Black Widow movie, Yelena, Natasha's sister, steals the show a lot during the film. It's nice to see her, but I would've liked more Black Widow in the film. Really, whenever Yelena or Alexi are on screen, they steal the spotlight. The villain was develop ok, sort of, and so was Natasha's family. The action scenes in this film don't need some magic for sci-fi. It's like action from a James Bond movie, and it works well with this movie. Another issue I have with the film was that the start was pretty good, but the rest of the film just kind of falls. I also hated how they portrayed Red Guardian in this movie. They treat him like he's an idiot, and I wish there was one moment where he had a chance to shine as Red Guardian I just hope not to see any Black Widow family memes. Overall a decent MCU return to the big screen."
2913,7,"A decent one The plot was great and fun loving. There were some good action scenes and some emotional and family scenes too. As u can expect from MCU , It was a good movie with a good post credit scenes too. Ending was nice."
2914,8,"well-made Marvel backstory 'Black Widow' is the latest MCU film, taking place after 'Captain America: Civil War' and before 'Avengers: Infinity War', where we get to see Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) doing her bad-ass spy thing solo. Or mostly solo - she's joined, at times, by her ""unique"" family: father Alexi (Harbour), mother Melina (Weisz) and sister Yelena (Pugh). There's plenty of backstory there and it's well handled.Having Pugh & Harbour actually added way more humour than I was expecting, which was good to see and helped keep things moving. However, this is primarily a Bond-style action-packed car-chase into explosion into hand-to-hand-combat film. And that's what 'Black Widow' should be - she has no super-powers, after all. The plot involves Natasha going after ""the Red Room"", which is the spy agency that programmed her to be an assassin. Dreykov (Winstone) and the skull-helmeted semi-cyborg (no spoilers!) are OK as the bad guys, even if they don't have that much screen time.Pretty satisfying conclusion, with the post-credits scene linking back into some of the Marvel TV shows. I enjoyed all the scenes with Harbour, but Pugh steals the show, with some solid stunts/fights, but mostly her well-placed quips. It's also a fitting conclusion if this is the last time we see Johansson as Black Widow, as she's so assured in the role that you feel light at home when she's on screen. Bring on Phase 4!"
2915,5,"Welcome to everything feminine Black Window is an example of how to ruin good movies and great comic character. Rip taskmaster.And we can all assume most of the male characters in mcu universe according to mcu universe are abusive a-holes.Watch it only for action scene, that's it , nothing more is there."
2916,7,Great cast! The cast is fantastic. Marvel know how to chose the best actors for those roles.Not the best Marvel but still very good. Not sure it does make sense she does all this without some of the Avengers but well....
2917,10,"Definitely Worth the wait! My favourite 2 hours and 13 minutes for sure😌. The action, the performances and the story are making a masterpiece. Ignore every rating under 7👍👍. Top."
2918,6,"They are a little late.. I watched Black Widow against my better judgment and it's very mediocre at most. It doesn't hold up to the tier that was set with movies pre-endgame. I am struggling with understanding how people have the courage to say Winter Soldier in the same sentence. It's not even close.Sure this movie is clearly better than Cpt. Marvel that is obvious but the whole script comes down to crying and talking with some more crying. Natasha is EXTREMELY annoying when she's soft and I couldn't stand her in the second half of the movie.I did like the twist though (not about the silent villain because that one was obvious) and little sister which stole the show in my personal opinion. I am guessing she will handle Black Widow character moving forward.Red Guardian was degraded to the place where his job was only cracking poor jokes and getting beaten up. It was very sad to see it.When it comes to the effects there is something off about them, they don't look bad per se but kinda cheap? Worst part is that all of it felt not required, more like pre-planned expectations of what came before.There is no denying it, they are late with this one, it should have aired in the place of Cpt. Marvel and now it feels like a miss fire. Not very smart dear Marvel.The biggest gripe I have with this though is Scarlet herself, she was made old and ugly in this one. I hope it was at least what they were gunning for.In short it's an explosions and superhero fights type of a movie.I was asking myself throughout the bigger portion of the movie, why? Why not go full on with espionage? Why not make Black Widow what she was meant to be, why not show us all those amazing stories they were always talking about?Now we will never know. I don't regret watching it so that's at least 1+ and I wasn't preached to which on its own gets another star. Solid 6\10."
2919,10,"Amazing Finally a female super here movie that got it right. Loved every relationship, character and action scene."
2920,9,"Some interesting stuff... Ok so I wasn't expecting much but it was well made movie, actually I lost the habit of watching a film of marvel because we are watching series from a long time, And yes it brought back Marvel to movies. I loved the action sequences, the story line, and everything else. And Yes it is connected with the future of MCU, so the ones who are not gonna watch it thinking its just a random movie then change your plan, AND YES DO WATCH THE POST CREDIT SCENE. And expecting black widow 2(no spoilers)"
2921,10,"An Action-Packed Family Movie, Ignore The Mindless Haters This movie gave us everything we wanted and more. Everything was perfect. About the haters, some of them want every movie to be like Endgame level. They want 10 cameos or they're gonna hate it. Some of them are angry because the movie is about women. And some are just angry because of the political truth of this movie. It's an action movie. A family movie. Enjoy it. Take your girls and women to watch it together. It'll surely inspire them to fight the world and lead their own lives."
2922,3,Errrrr No!!!! We just saw actions and all. It didn't make sense to me. Looks so low budget and the characters had less emotions on their face.I dosed off like 2 times seeing the movie. It was very difficult to understand the movie as no main story.
2923,10,BEST ACTION BLACK WIDOW It's finally paid off after almost a long wait for the Black Widow solo film. I say this is the best Action film with a little bit of family drama and a little comedy from Red Guardian... Thank you Marvel Studios and Walt Disney for providing this extraordinary epic spectacle.
2924,7,"Fun and exciting. But, expected way better than that. After nearly 2 years, Marvel Studious return with ""Black Widow"". A solid return that would make every Marvel fan happy/excited. But, not satisfied.The film is really fun to watch especially that everyone is hungry for a Marvel Film. The film starts off in a great way that would confuse you a bit but in a good way because you would be curious to know why and how this is happening which would make you want to watch the film and continue it until the end. Something that surprised me is that although the film is 2h 15m, I didn't feel that.Black Widow is a character that we always wanted to know about her history. What happened to her? Who really is she? How did she become Black Widow? The film answered all of that. But, honestly, I expected more. I felt like her story was this typical story of a woman who becomes a spy/agent. Which in my opinion makes the impact on the character weak and little. The plot is just so predictable and there's nothing new about it at all. You would know where it's going and what'll happen. Also, the dialogues were cheesy and gringy at sometimesThe villain in the film was barely even there. For Taskmaster, all i'm saying is that they really ruined the character. One of the things that I was looking forward to was Taskmaster and I didn't even see him that much.The action scenes in the film were so enjoyable and fun, especially the opening. Watching those fight scenes brought up that excitement part in me that was always hungry for a Marvel (Action) Film.Scarlett Johnson's performance was obviously great as always. She always puts on a great performance, especially as Natasha Romanoff. Florence Pugh is one of the best things in the film. Not just that, also her character (Yelena Belova) is more than amazing. Pugh's acting was great especially in emotional/dramatic scenes. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz as well as their characters were also well done.The film's directing, CGI, cinematography, etc. Were all normal and nothing special about them which bothered me and wished if they were better so I could give the film a higher rating because those elements are important to any film and would make a difference.Black Widow felt like it is a film that is made only to satisfy the fans and not the story and where/how it fits into the MCU. It's is a solid return and a fun movie to watch especially on the big screen. But, I really expected more. Or in another way, I WANTED MORE.My rating is 7/10."
2925,5,"Was expecting a good version of Red Sparrow, got a generic action film To hint what Melina and Alexei are about, they start off by showing her ""scientist"" side by explaining bioluminescence to a 6 years old and the brawls on the dad by having him kill a bunch of feds with a rifle. Now we have settled the intelligent female and the muscles male, which later on we will find out that she was responsible for improving a technology that controlled the Widows and he was the Crimson Dynamo - my bad, Alexei, Red Guardian -, the Soviet Super Soldier.As they escape, did anyone else find odd that a 6-years-old's song was a 70's song about running away? It felt forced to suit the moment, specially from parents that lived by a different ideology, how was she shown a 70's song? Something else that bothered me was Melina being shot and now Natasha is supposed to pilot the plane, she is even able to take off with the plane despite how hard the yoke is.Then we follow Yelena, still under the effects of that drug, to catch someone, they start to fight in the middle of the street after the target is ran over. We get to see there are people on that street and they simply acted like there wasn't a fight going on? That there was a body lying on the ground?Natasha was living in a trailer and there we get two buutshots in different segments from Natasha, one would think that with a female director we wouldn't see this kind of sexist shots, or they aren't sexist when shot by a female director?After we see Natasha and Yelena's first reunion in decades, they are on a standoff and what better way to show that they are bad ass spies than having them disarm the other and equip their gun? It is just the most overused move in action films with spies. They get a truce after throwing some fists and Natasha asks Yelena what are those vials to which she replies something like ""did you bring that back here?"" hmm... excuse me? Natasha doesn't know what that is about, she probably didn't even know her ""sister"" was alive and Yelena throws yet another cliche? Come on, writers, you can do better than that. By the way, what's up with Yelena's heavy Russian accent? Russian spies were taught to speak without any hint of accent so why does she?Still in Yelena's place there is an editing mistake that you wouldn't expect from Disney,we get the Red Room spies blowing up Yelena's flat's roof, and we see two dropping from the hole., Yelena moves forward to grab those vials, but she reacts two the other two spies coming from the door but were closer to Natasha, then back at Yelena the spies finally drop to the floor.We have some moments when Yelena acts too meta when she says how Natasha always does a pose when she lands to the ground or when Natasha is about to tell her something and Yelena replies ""you're about to give me a super hero's speech"", making for of the landing pose I found it alright, but the ""super hero speech"" why writers, why must you be so cringe?There is also the secrecy of the Red Room, which nobody knows where it is and they felt like they have to enforce that some 5 or 6 times, we get it, it is secret, stop repeating.When Yelena mocks Natasha's landing pose, she makes some weird old people noises, she does the same noise when she climbing a flight of stairs to get in the helicopter, is Yelena a granny? Why does she sound like that?Later one, we finally see the antagonist of the film, too late if you ask me, still he goes on about his plan, how actual power lies in the dark, still he suffers from the I-have-to-tell-you-my-plan syndrome and as you can guess it backfires on him, specially when someone that controls a super secret organization is so easily taunted by Natasha. I'm starting to think Disney saved the money on the writers to pay for Scarlett's wage, how can writers make so many mistakes?In the end, we see Natasha taking on like 20 Widows, I get Natasha fighting 20 minions in other films, but aren't Widows supposed to be super spies or something? How can Natasha take so many of them at the same time?I'm done with my notes, worthwhile moments are the comedic and family ones, they are alright, nothing great, but in such a mediocre film you got cling to what you find good. Also, I was a disappointed with the Taskmaster, I thought its role would have been way more important considering the first, and only, trailer I saw. On the same lines, some things aren't explained like, how does Dreykov and his daughter survive such explosion? How was Yelena and Natasha assigned to be the daughters? Why didn't we get nothing from Natasha's ""training"" on the Red Room besides those weird flashes? The film felt lacking, it could have been so much more, so much better. I don't blame the actors, I think they did a good job, but the story itself was lame, and I wasn't expecting anything of this film."
2926,8,"It is not a pathbreaking movie in any way, but definitely is reliably entertaining. Black Widow is finally out after several delays due to the global pandemic and is the first Marvel movie we've got in two long years. This is basically a fan service, so what you get is a filler movie, simply giving us some answers about Natasha's past.The story as we know from the trailer is about Natasha going back to Russia and is reunited with her dysfunctional family. The treatment of the movie is classic marvel, i.e. A little bit of emotional drama with comedy sprinkled over it enough to not let it go to the dark ""DC"" side. It has all the predictable yet fun elements in it.Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Black Widow one last time and delivers another reliable kick-ass performance that we expect from her. We get all her signature moves- the kicks, the head locks and even the cool superhero landing. She is simply fantastic!Supporting her is her aforementioned dysfunctional family. The mom is smart, dangerous and cunning, played by the stunning Rachel Weisz. The dad is big and goofy but equally strong and menacing, played by the reliably charming David Harbour and finally the young kid sister is played by my Florence Pugh, who is equally bad-ass as her big sister Natasha and as annoying a young sibling should be. She is unarguably my favorite in the movie.This movie has everything you expect from a Marvel movie. The action set pieces are great and are choreographed to the highest entertainment level. The CGI is what we have come to expect from a Marvel movie. The cinematography and camerawork are also top notch.The two big negatives that I would say this movie has are - a). It does not have a strong villain (it has two villains but neither of them are strong enough for our Avenger) b). We know exactly when and how Natasha is going to die in the MCU timeline, so at no point do we really feel that she is in any real danger during any of the fight scenes, so that takes away from a bit of thrill that it could've benefited from.Overall I would say Black Widow had a lot of potential to be great, but ends up being just good. Still, it's worth your time and money to go check it out in a theater near you, especially in an IMAX or Dolby, i.e. If you are fully vaccinated of course. Otherwise you can stream it on Disney+ Premier Access.P. S. - As is Marvel tradition, the movie has one post credit scene, so you'll probably have to tell your bladder to hush when the credits roll."
2927,8,Choppy third act but does it job It's not good as I expected it to beI expected it to be dark like the scene from age of ultron.The lack of red room natasha's dark past is disappointing.Yelena is great Florence and Scarlett's performance is great.I felt like the Russo's should've directed this.THAT TASKMASTER REVEAL SUCKED.
2928,9,"WORTH WAITING Just finish the work u r doing and watch this film. The story is really good, every one has done a great job. The music is brilliant. Top notch fight scenes. Yeah the taskmaster disappointed me a bit but its Really worth watching. ENJOY THE FILM."
2929,10,Awesome The movie is awesome with more action packed scenes.
2930,7,"Brilliant Grand Finale for Black Widow I came into the theater expecting an intense movie that would keep me on the edge of my seat; Marvel did not disappoint. Black Widow is a visually stunning masterpiece that tells Natasha's backstory in a compelling, emotionally intense journey. Mix Winter Soldier with Bourne, add some 007 and Ragnarok's humor, and you get this brilliant addition to the MCU canon.Overall, a very good movie that I already want to go see again to make sure I didn't miss anything."
2931,1,"Huge hype disappointed I really loved the Black Widow, first half pulled of tremendously when it's comes to final totally left with the disappointment."
2932,10,Bonkers!! Literally a movie she deserved Why why the low ratings I dunno what other people were thinking about but the movie is literally awesome it's kinda amused me please don't bother yourself with bad reviews just watch it.
2933,10,Lots of Scarlett Johansson action! Marvel Perfect...balance between storyline and action. I don't agree that it is just a typical Marvel movie. It has a string female cast who kicked some serious... I am a Hollywood action blockbuster freak and Black Widow was worth the $29 for Premier Access on Disney Plus.
2934,2,"Any of you looking for the exit at min 32? Horrible screenplay.How was it that nobody checked the writers' work before starting?Who approved the fight scenes?What was the logic behind the two sisters reunion part of the movie?I started writing this review one hour in to the movie - is that horrible.The only reason I am not storming the exit is because I am with friends.Marvel, it is time to hire some professional writers and directors, isn't it? And there are many out there!"
2935,10,Perfect start for phase 4 This movie is amazing Florence Pugh stole the show. Nat got a pretty good ending. Also we got to know what happened in Budapest. Post credit scene is connected to falcon and the winter soilder and also it leads to Hawkeye series!!!!!!!
2936,2,Um.... what? If you like watching small women fight this movie is for you. It feels like the camera men is slouching to record down to their level. I like the car scene where it seems they can't see over the dashboard.
2937,8,"Worth watching Johansson and pugh did awesome, Villan was meh, Over-all enjoyable movie."
2938,7,"Not too bad The movie is quite solid with awesome chemistry between the family, good acting, action and great humour scattered throughout. It made me want to see more of these characters. On the downside, there are some cliche lines that are a bit annoying and the villain/s are quite bland, unoriginal and un-compelling. I've heard people complaining that they don't like the movie as it doesn't feel necessary, which kind of makes sense, but why does it need to be? Just enjoy it for what it is. I would definitely still recommend seeing this."
2939,8,"Great Marvel Entry Black Widow was pretty impressive, and surprisingly well paced for what it was worth. The story was a little too late for its own good to come to fruition, but it was awesome being able to see Black Widow earn her own solo film. Scarlett Johansson played her wonderfully and shown emotional leverage to the character.Florence Pugh was also just as good, if not better, in some parts of this film. She's a rising star, especially coming from Midsommar, directed by Ari Aster. I believe she has much more talent to show to the world overtime.The rest of the film itself is good, it's fun and it's well done as most Marvel movies are. The villain was awesome, and is unquestionably one of the most badass villains to come to the MCU.My only complaints are some of the decisions on timing of the story, and where it takes place- it's pretty incoherent and almost at some point seems to feel convoluted in terms of matching up with the MCU's timeline- but I think they made do with what they could and it doesn't affect it dramatically in the long run. The CGI is also a lot less stellar (which is insane comparing this to Endgame's use of CGI) in this movie which is strange due to the budgeting and income these Marvel films make. You will notice poor CGI in some scenes, but the choreography and set pieces are super epic.All in all, I'd recommend Black Widow for Marvel fans and those that wanted to see their heroine finally get her own screen time, it's a fun, solid watch. It just has some chips along the way."
2940,10,Excellent fun! As amazing as I had hoped it would be. A perfect post-pandemic blockbuster! 👍
2941,5,"Covid delays made this worse The 3 failed launch dates made this movie to be more desired than it could deliver.The story of Natasha pre infinity war and just after/during civil war, finds it a pointless story that did little to fill in her backstory, which was weak at best.A story between infinity war and endgame would have been better.With no flashback scenes on Natasha's history the plot was more explosions and humour driven.It felt more showing strong action women than having a compelling story.End scene is nice and leads to the next marvel series. Does nothing to process the MCU or the next phase of movies.This movie should have been made 5-6 years ago and would have felt more in place and needed.A movie showing black widow after her endgame END just looses its feeling."
2942,7,Fans asked solo movie and they just threw at our face I can't belive it. They made is such a mess. I am gonna be honest Action is ok. Family Drama is also ok.Nothing depth in story.The movie was like studio just fulfilled fan's demand and nothing more than that.This movie is easily forgettable.This movie doesn't add anything in long run except post credit scene.Last but not least Post Credit scene was lot better than 50% of the movie.
2943,5,"Disappointing, I expected better from the pre screening hype. I really wanted to like this film but was disappointed. I am a big Johansson fan, but she seems disinterested throughout the film. The storytelling was disjointed and confusing at times. The typical pithy dialog between sympathetic characters was as expected for and Avenger's type movie. Cinematics were average for this type of film. The villain character was never fully developed and was hardly seen at all, and when he was, he was very generic in presence and his dialog was childish at best.I was wishing for something more along the line of Lucy with this one. Scarlett Johansson is so much better than this."
2944,6,"Mediocre A lesser mission impossible type of film and nothing more, is not even in the same league as other MCU films and series, for the most part I like the characters, and the general Idea is fine, but is just surface level on all its aspects, it lacks dimension and finesse, is not a work of art, is just a mild blockbuster, and to be absolutely clear, is not the actors fault, but everything else is just meh, a proven director should be chosen for this first instalment."
2945,6,"Now in 2021, a 2014 movie I, like many, have wanted to see a Black Widow movie since 2014; I wasn't fully bought on a Black Widow movie during Iron Man 2 or The Avengers, but by Winter Soldier I was bought.So, this movie takes place following Captain America: Civil War; Natasha is on the run from authorities, and is instantly drawn into helping her 'sister' Yelena to help free all other Widows around the world from brain control, and must reunite with their 'parents' to find the ""Red Room"" the super secretive KGB base where they can end that brainwashing.That plot alone makes me think that the producers felt they were forced to make this movie, not just the fact that it took them upwards of 7 years to finally make a black widow movie. It's another movie with a villain who wants to take over the world. While I was watching this in the cinema I kept asking myself, ""should this movie be set after Civil War""? I kept imagining this movie taking place after Infinity War; Thanos has just wiped out half of all life on Earth, and maybe this could push Natasha into finally tracking down the only family she had before the Avengers. One of this movies muddled and not fully realised themes is ""family"". I really liked David Harbour and Rachel Weisz as Natasha's 'parents' in this movie, I just wished the movie could've truly buckled down and had some serious moments; moments that don't instantly get interrupted with jokes. Why does Marvel keep doing that with serious moments in their movies? There was one scene (spoilers) after Harbour's character Alexei gets broken out of prison where Yelena explains her forced Hysterectomy, and I was a bit taken aback that it was played off as a comedic moment. That wasn't the case with Natasha and Bruce in Age of Ultron; this should have been a serious moment between Natasha and Yelena while talking to Alexei and Melina. I just wish some of the bigger implications and realities of being trained as an assassin for years since childhood were brought up between the four of them, but we never get that (wasted opportunities galore).One big problem I have with this movie is the brainwashing plot. It's just a cheap way to take away any agency or self responsibility from Natasha, her sister, and the other widows. The Black Widows are strictly trained killers, years and years of indoctrination from an early age, and have the movie explore Natasha struggle with that, and repenting for her crimes. But instead, no, she was just brainwashed.Another problem I had with the movie is that Natasha's basically Wonder Woman throughout the movie (durability wise, not character wise). There's an action scene right after she reunites with Yelena where she falls from a 4-5 story building, and she's hitting stuff on the way down, and she lands perfectly on her feet, no broken or sprained arms or legs, no cuts, not even a limp. She's obviously not gonna die in this movie but by god, could you also not make her a Mary Sue as well? Even Yelena gets a few cuts and bruises.My biggest problem with the movie overall though is that it's pointless filler; Black Widow's dead in the MCU now; does it matter what she did post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War? I like learning about her early life and I like knowing more about the Black Widow organisation she came from. Overall, I'm glad we got a Black Widow movie. What I'm not happy about is everything I've laid out in my review. I have no interest in ever watching it again. The only sliver of interest I got from the movie was Florence Pugh as Yelena; I would welcome her becoming the new Black Widow in any future MCU movies. I like that the post credit scene ties into the upcoming Hawkeye movie so I'm waiting for that at least.I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10. You wanna sit through the MCU version of a Michael Bay movie, I'd recommend it."
2946,9,"Thoroughly enjoyable return to Marvel Very fun movie all in, fleshing out Black Widow from her relatively unknown background, featuring terrific supporting performances. Enjoyable action set pieces, and also very funny at points. One complaint would be Ray Winstone as a fairly one dimensional villain who rarely featured, but other than that would highly recommend this movie.An issue with some other reviews appears to be downgrading this film because ""it's just another movie saying women are better than men"". Firstly, a completely wrong take, and secondly, did you expect a solo film about a female Avenger and her sister to feature male heroes?All in, thoroughly enjoyable and good to be back in the cinema. Can also appreciate the work from Marvel and Disney to tie this in to the franchise so it's not a standalone films."
2947,9,It was so good I liked everything about it but the taskmaster reveal was not what I expected didn't like it to be honest but the rest of the movie was so good.
2948,8,"Soaring Spy Adventure is One of MCU's Most Action-Packed I saw Black Widow in Regal's 4DX format on opening night. It was an incredible showcase for 4DX, with all of its car crashes, hand-to-hand combat and explosions. The chairs almost throw you out onto the floor at some points. One particular segment ended with an audible ""wow"" from the audience, and laughs after the violently shaking chairs finally stopped. I saw my first 4DX ""snow,"" thanks to one scene set in a wintery locale. At one point, the 4DX put out a giant plume of smoke that was just too much. It obscured half the screen for a couple of minutes. The smoke's the only part of 4DX I would do away with. The 3D also looked very pleasing to the eye, with a lot of shots with noticeable depth. I think Godzilla: King of the Monsters was the only 4DX I've seen that was more intense than this one.It looks like Marvel Studios might've spent the year-long delay of this movie polishing up the effects and tightening up the editing, because this is one of the MCU's most technically flawless movies. Kevin Feige clearly has a well-oiled machine in place to produce these films. The movie's credited director has only directed three no-budget films before, so it's inconceivable to me that she could pull off a production this massive with so little experience without a lot of help.I thought that overall this was one of the strongest MCU movies. It was a welcome change of pace to see a down-to-earth spy thriller after the heavy sci-fi and superhero storyline in Endgame. This, at different times, felt like the 1980s G. I. Joe cartoon, the James Bond franchise and the Mission: Impossible movies. My two favorite MCU movies are Winter Soldier and Endgame. I enjoyed this one just about as much as Winter Soldier. It was definitely much more entertaining than their other recent film Captain Marvel, a dull, dry outing that is one of my least favorite MCU movies.Black Widow probably has plot holes, but it's so fast-paced and action-packed that you don't have a lot of spare time to think about the plot. This movie functions on the level of pure action, making it almost a pointless exercise to analyze the story. Therefore, I also wasn't too concerned about what any of the ""reveals"" were going to be. There isn't a lot of time to think during this movie. There's only one three-minute scene in the middle when the momentum grinds to a halt, and half the theater seemed to be checking their phones or muttering to each other. Then things pick right back up. There's a lot of backstory in the film covered in flashbacks and dialogue exchanges. I think I understood MOST of it, which is a laudable achievement for the film considering how incomprehensible a lot of spy thrillers can get.As it goes on, the movie loses some of its down-to-earth grit and gets more over-the-top and less plausible. By the end, it starts to feel more like a comic book and less like an adult spy thriller, because of the incredible feats of derring-do that the characters are able to pull off. But I can't really complain about that, because I knew going in this is based on a comic book, and not on the grittiest or most hard-boiled source material. Still, maybe there are some difficult situations that the characters get out of just a little too smoothly and easily at times.Florence Pugh was the most interesting actor to watch in the film. As the ""other"" Black Widow in the movie, she was the second most important character to pull off, and she achieved that to the maximum extent possible. She's the one character in the movie I would eagerly anticipate seeing more of, if possible. As for ScarJo, this is probably her best performance as Black Widow, but I still feel she was miscast in the role from the beginning. Emily Blunt would've nailed this part in a way ScarJo just isn't capable of. I feel satisfied now that I've seen enough of ScarJo in the MCU, and she can be retired. I didn't recognize Ray Winstone in this film. I'm not that familiar with him, but he sure gave a different, and better, performance here than he did in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The Red Guardian character, as indicated in the trailers, is largely here to provide comic relief. He was something of a caricature and not the best part of the movie by a long shot. I enjoyed him more when he was given some moments of dignity.I feel like this movie leaves wide open the possibility that we may get a similar Captain America movie, set between Civil War and Infinity War. If I recall, what Steve Rogers was doing during that time was left just as vague as what Natasha was doing. For any new fans to the MCU, I think this movie should be watched in chronological order after Civil War, EXCEPT for the post-credits epilogue. The home video release ought to move that to a bonus feature with spoiler warnings.On an unrelated note, as a G. I. Joe franchise fan, I'm greatly disappointed that the G. I. Joe movies don't feel a lot more like Winter Soldier and Black Widow. 1980s G. I. Joe was based right off of the Marvel Avengers comics in many ways, but the people making the G. I. Joe movies don't have 1% of the understanding that Marvel Studios does of how these kinds of stylized action-adventure stories are supposed to be done."
2949,4,awful I'm sorry but it was a literal fever dream. More of a parody than a real movie.
2950,10,"Incredible from start to finish I've been waiting a long time for this movie and it did not disappoint! Excellent storytelling, non stop action and fantastic visual effects.Honestly am so keen for the direction that Marvel are leading us to. The future is Super that's for sure!"
2951,8,"A solid Marvel movie Black Widow brings MCU back in theatres after two years and it perfectly catches the spirit of Marvel. It's a solid movie with great characters and good chemistry between them, the acting is also great, with a Florence Pugh completely.in the part and a good Scarlett Johansson. The action sequences are great, intense and keep the viewer focused; also the costumes are great. Natasha's backstory is well built and the whole development of her character is very emotional, a not so frequent aspect in MCU.However the movie has some flaws, such as the villain, as often happens in MCU, it's stereotyped; and Taskmaster is a weak character.Nevertheless it's a great marvel movie, in my opinion a lot better than Captain Marvel and Black Panther's stand alones."
2952,10,"Had BIG expectations and still managed to exceed them I don't get how people can dislike this movie, yeah taskmaster was a little bit dissapointing but it doesn't mean the movie is bad. Honestly Yelena is such a great character, definitely top 5 mcu characters imo."
2953,9,"First Class yet again by Marvel... An excellent film and fitting swansong for Natasha, along with the introduction of (and obvious eventual handover to) Yelena. Great cast, Scarlet just owns this character and is magnetic as ever, and very ably supported by Florence Pugh - BW future in good hands. This along with excellent supporting cast, tremendous action, humour, music - once again Marvel haven't let us down. Perhaps not QUITE at the exact same level as Winter Soldier (which for me is a 10) but just for minor reasons - would have preferred the taking down the Red Room - gist of story - to be more 'grounded', Taskmaster a powerful enemy (though not the main/only protagonist) but not quite up to Bucky as the Winter Soldier), no explanation how Nat avoids Ross at the end (really wanted Cap to show up, not that the Widow needs saving but thought would have been fitting to see how they end up together again before Infinity War), but that aside very much enjoyed. Thanks Nat, it's been a blast."
2954,8,"Marvel Studios once again knocking it out of the park Black Widow is such a fitting end to Scarlett's run in the MCU (assuming it is her last appearance, with the multiverse seemingly opening up anything is possible I suppose). It dispenses with the world saving high stakes of her Avengers ensemble films and has a much smaller scale, with a greater character focus which I loved. In style and tone this is more akin to The Winter Soldier, functioning as a more gritty spy movie than big superhero blockbuster.Her character arc and transformation from her previous appearances is explored more fully in this film, as we return to the oft alluded to dark past she thought she had left behind. We explore the inner workings of the Widows and all of this is done so well, feeling quite James Bondy at times. Getting this exploration of Natasha was long overdue and very welcome.The plot is good, with lots of emotional beats and solid action throughout. They really do just know how to tell stories on film over at Marvel Studios. The pacing is always spot on and Black Widow was no exception. The action was expertly crafted and the set pieces looked great up on the IMAX screen.The Marvel casting team very rarely miss, and aside from a slightly dodgy Russian accent from Ray Winstone, the cast were spot on. Florence Pugh is easily one of the best actresses working right now and her introduction to the MCU was triumphant. Everything about her character was perfect, from the emotion and backstory to the trademark Marvel humour, they nailed it all. David Harbour was equally brilliant and I do hope we get to see his Red Guardian again, I would be interested to see a Disney Plus show with him as our protagonist. Rachel Weisz I could have done with more of, but that's a small gripe. Scarlett was of course great in the role, she knows this character back to front by now and did her justice. The interactions between all 4 of these characters were so fun to watch.As with any great Marvel film, we also see some connections forming with other characters and MCU projects. Phase 4 is well and truly underway and I can't wait to see how everything comes together.Black Widow may not reach the heights of Marvel's best like Infinity War, but it has so much going for it and it is a most welcome addition to the MCU. Primarily this is due to its gritty action and superb cast of characters. If this really is the end for Black Widow in the MCU, then it was a glorious exit and a fitting end to the MCU's original female badass."
2955,6,"Entertaining but careless...(spoiler alert) This movie had a nice nuanced beginning, fine set pieces, a great lead and some emotional and funny moment really pay off... But is feels a bit indifferent and careless, as if the filmmakers don't take the audience seriously. Winstone as a one dimensional stock villain, the hokey and clichéd portrayal of Russians (and their accents), it feels dated.And I guess I'm not the only one who noticed the confusing casting of the younger/ older Antonia. When an already adult Natasha attacks her and her dad, she's still a young girl. A couple of years later .... (spoiler)... she's face to face with the now older Antonia and now she's played by an actor who's seemingly not the right age to be the grown-up version of that little girl (actually older then Scarlett) . A truly great actor though, Olga Kurylenko, who even though badly miscast, has an underwritten part. She serves better than this miscalculation that took me out of the movie. The fact that a superhero-film is make believe doesn't mean that you don't have to cast in a logical way. It's this it is this indifference to the intelligence of the audience that makes a fun movie a slight let down."
2956,10,"A Marvellous Addition I don't know what everyone is griping about, this was a great film. Lots of action and lots of heart, with the heart really making the film. This for me was right up there with CA: Winter Soldier and both some of Marvels best offerings."
2957,8,"The least super of heroes get a thoroughly fun backstory Loved it much more than I expected. It's hard to hold attention with characters that aren't really ""super"", but this film did it quite well on smart dialogue and wits alone. Bravo."
2958,4,We all know that Natasha softened up a little bit due to like working with cap. She also love going fights and battles she knows how to control her emotions better than anybody and they didn't really do that in this film which was kind of aggravating a little bit and I understand you know oh it's the path she's taking whatever but still at the same time when she's in the middle of a fight or a war she knows how to shut her emotions off until the time being is over and I mean they were making her care too much that's not who Black widow is. And that's not how she spends her the whole every MCU movie yes she at the after the battle is over and everything but not in the middle of it. She doesn't try and grab an enemy's hand help them so they don't fall. ThatThat was very aggravating the other thing is yes training is great and yes I understand they did all of these girls were assassins and they all were trained you know but there's a whole other thing when it comes to life experience fighting for your life and fighting and Natasha's don't have more than all of them put together so for them to even come close in a fight was kind of upsetting as well and that's even including the villain taskmaster because if you think about it he's really not in that much so and I know what his power is but they also did his power wrong he doesn't like carbon copies someone he figures out their moves and then figures out with their next moves going to be .
2959,4,I know they were all train the same way but no one should have been able to even come close to Natasha With all the fighting and battling the Natasha has done none of the other female agents should really come close to her in a fight because she's taking on superpowered villains our whole last 10 years of her life so a couple female agents and even the villain really I mean she should be able she really should have been able to kill any of them I mean she was going to toe with thanos's soldiers so a couple of female russian spies that aren't souped up shouldn't Cakewalk but instead they make it because they will train the same way that they're close to her when it should have been too completely different universes also we've been really cool to have cap make a cameo. In the beginning to like maybe help her out or you know since especially they were the last two that were on the run.
2960,7,"Pretty solid MCU entry that is carried by the performances and action. I liked the film overall, but I cannot help but ponder how much more hyped I'd be had I had seen this prior to INFINITY WAR, but as a stand alone knowing what happens to Black Widow in ENDGAME, it still works.Pretty solid spy action flick. It kinda breezes by as there aren't many dull moments thanks to the performances. Florence Pugh is quite good in the film as Yelena Belova. Personally I wasn't intrigued by the character in the comics and I didn't think much of her in the trailers, but after seeing the film she is quite the scene stealer and bounces off Scarlett Johansson very well. There's a hilarious moment where she mocks Natasha's superhero landing.Speaking of Scarlett she can play this role in her sleep. She carries the film very well and there's a nice feeling of passing the torch kind of feel. She's also surrounded by a nice supporting cast. Dave Harbor and Rachel Weisz bring a lot flare to their characters Red Guardian and Melina. I don't expect this, but as a fan of comics I wonder if Melina in particular will progress to be the more comic accurate version of the character.Now this is a spoiler review so I'm going to talk about Taskmaster. Personally, I kinda bought into the twist as the daughter of Ray Winstone's General Dreykov, who is totally mind controlled. I wasn't too bothered by it, but it's like a scratch that I couldn't inch because frankly speaking, Taskmaster isn't in the film often. More I think would have benefitted truthfully. I think for diehard Taskmaster fans they might consider this an IRON MAN 3 Mandarin kind of ordeal, BUT I felt that here at least they tried to do something unique about Taskmaster, where as the Mandarin in IRON MAN 3 was a complete joke for the shock of all things. She is portrayed by Olga Kurylenko and despite the very brief screen time, I felt she delivered her performance effectively.Action I thought was good, but nothing mind blowing. I did feel the third act could have been better. Maybe a longer fight between Natasha and Taskmaster or maybe longer fight scene while she's falling from the sky. What you see in the trailer is what you really get...nothing too exciting. It all kinda wrapped up neatly and while I appreciated all the mind control aspect of the film with chemical pheromones, at times it did feel like an easy way out.I appreciated the more serious tone in this film. I savor all the MCU films that disregard their formulaic humor for some more serious story-telling like the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first IRON MAN and INFINITY WAR. Not to say that they can't do humor right as the first GUARDIANS and the first AVENGERS handle it perfectly. HOWEVER, I think they could have pushed the boundary with the serious stuff a little more. Like really dive into the fact that these Widows are kidnapped at a young age in light of human trafficking or the fact that all the Widows are sterile.Overall, in cinematic terms, it's a good start to Phase 4. We also get a nice tease to the Hawkeye Disney+ show.7/10."
2961,7,"a cool side-movie in the MCU I had a good time with this movie. I was invested throughout. I loved the characters, especially the new additions of Yelena and Alexei. The characters have great chemistry. And I laughed a lot.Florence Pugh and David Harbour rock in this movie. Florence Pugh continues to impress me. Her acting skills are top notch (see Midsommar) and i already knew she could kick butt (see Fighting with My Family). There are a couple of acting moments she has where I was like, damn. And David Harbour plays his role amazingly. So funny. Likeable in an unlikeable way, if that makes sense.There are two things this movie almost does that could have made it amazing. One is to go for a darker tone. And I don't mean like the ominous feeling of Infinity War. But a genuinely dark tone that would work perfectly with the dark thematic background of the main character. And the start of the movie made me think they were going that route. It was pretty messed up. But the rest of the movie felt exactly like the template MCU movie. I love that template, but it would have been cool to see something different here.The second thing that could have made it stand out is the musical score. I've complained so many times that the weakest part of the MCU is the music. There are a few scores I like, but most are unimpactful. The new MCU shows have stepped it up (Wandavision, Falcon Winty, and especially Loki).When black widow started, I loved the musical score. It was immediately impactful and elevated the prologue. It gave the movie character. And then the credits show that it's composed by Lorne Balfe, who has become one of my favorite composers. But as usual in the MCU, the music is kept mostly in the background and has very little impact on the scenes. Think of the music played during the final fight in Civil War or during the funeral scene in Thor 2. The music owns me. And it could have in black widow. But I barely noticed it for the rest of the movie.The action is pretty awesome. A couple of moments in the fight scenes were unclear, but it was mostly well-done. Overall I had a great time with this movie, and I liked it even more the second time. (2 viewings, opening night 7/8/2021, 12/1/2021)"
2962,8,"Marvel's Mission: Impossible, anyone...? Don't get me wrong, there's a hell of a lot to like about Black Widow. Everybody involved turns in a strong performance, with particular kudos going to Florence Pugh and David Harbor, but in some, almost imperceptible way, this didn't feel like a Marvel movie. It did, however, feel like a typical post cold war romp like Mission: Impossible. That isn't meant as a criticism, it's just an observation.Having not been on the big screen for so long, what was really needed here was a dose of fantasy-derived escapism and not something more akin to The Manchurian Candidate with added costumes and explosions. Good - possibly very good! - but not great."
2963,8,So so cool Beautifully shown the new black widow The movie was so exciting and cool Thanks marvel.
2964,4,"Below average regular movie, terrible marvel movie The story is very basic, with little imagination. The action scenes felt forced.. the comedy fell flat. Also I feel like you could delete the first 45-60 minutes of the movie with little to no consequences .This gets 4 stars because it came out during a lull in movies and they chose 2 smoking hot actresses as stars. This is a non-pandemic 3 at best."
2965,10,Made my top ten list. I get we waited for well over a year but this movie deserves to be experienced on the big screen. I will definitely be seeing it again. 2021 is the year for MARVEL I can feel it.
2966,10,"awesome Making Alexei Nat's father instead of husband like in the comics is kind of weird, but I enjoyed the movie overall."
2967,8,"Good MCU Phase 4 Movie, Good Action, Good Stunning. Black Widow is a Good Start MCU Phase 4 Movie, Good Fighting in Red Room & Dinner, The Villain name Taskmaster was Ruined, But is Okay Rating.Rating: 8/10."
2968,10,"Don't really understand the negative ratings I thought the movie was good from beginning to end. Much better than I expected considering her character never stood out to me in the avengers. I found her storyline to be well written and executed. Well casted, intriguing, good action and great acting . Was actually funny too and not that cheesy one-liner funny, actually funny ."
2969,6,Mostly a wasted of time This movie came off as mostly an apology for not giving BW the movie she deserved 10 years ago. It's a fun watch but mostly forgettable and not a must see for the MCU as a whole. It was a wasted opportunity.
2970,6,"Styropor Looks like something, feels like something but it's nothing.They lacked substance so they inflated every possible little encounter.The beginning was ok though, I did believe for, say 15mn.Then it was boring. I didn't care (or identify) with any of the characters.The stunts and fights at first, are impressive, they have punch.But soon it's other the top, unbelievable.To me the jokes fell flat (you'll know)They like to show her bottom which makes sense.It's watchable if you've got nothing better to do."
2971,8,Surprisingly Excellent. I had a great time enjoying this movie with my teens.
2972,8,"Back to black... There've been complaints about the 'lateness' of this film, how it should've been made years ago and now that we've finally gotten it, it's 'too late'. I beg to differ, as I feel all good things come to those who wait (and those too impatient for something don't deserve it to begin with). However one may feel about Scarlett Johansson as an actress, there's no denying she's been in the MCU longer than most (if there's one 'good' thing about IM2, it's that it introduced this awesome character). She's done the hard yards and the fact that it's taken until now to get her well-deserved solo film isn't her fault (blame the higher-ups). While some dismissed her as 'not special' because she didn't possess super powers, she's proven her detractors wrong by enduring for so long.Johansson isn't given the credit she deserves for bringing such a complex character to life. Natasha is someone with some real demons in her past and she's done everything humanly possible to make up for her mistakes (unlike certain other so-called 'superheroes'). When the movie starts, we're in 1995 with young Natasha (Ever Anderson, who does a great job of not just looking like a young version of Scarlett Johansson, but also conveying so much for such a young actress) and her adoptive sister, Yelena (Violet McGraw, also doing a fine job for one so young), who're both capable of doing the 'spider walk' from The Exorcist. While those with short attention spans may find the opening 'boring', to those who aren't so easily bored, it's important for the movie to establish this sibling relationship, as this movie all about family.When the sisters are whisked away in an exciting airplane sequence and then separated, you really *feel* it, as young Natasha has shown her utter devotion to Yelena, willing to take on anyone to keep her safe. It's then that we're treated to probably one of the best montages in a comic book film that I can think of in recent memory, involving chilling images set to an unsettling version of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'. It immediately sets the mood for the rest of the film, which is actually a lot more brutal when it comes to the fights/kills than we've seen before in the MCU, and lets you know this will be a more 'mature' film. That's not to say there isn't some humour sprinkled throughout. It's there, but not overdone, and when the laughs do come, they're all the more effective *because* there hasn't been constant wisecracking (the biggest laugh had to be Yelena bringing up Natasha's superhero pose that she does and then acting it out).The best thing this movie did was casting Florence Pugh as grown-up Yelena, as she plays exceptionally well off Johansson and their onscreen chemistry makes for a believable sibling relationship. Their fight, after being reunited, is one of the film's best scenes, but the quieter heart-to-heart talks they have are equally important, as is their complicated relationships with their adoptive parents, Melina (Rachel Weisz) and Alexei (David Harbour), who bring different dynamics and add even more depth. 'Dysfunctional' doesn't begin to describe this family, but when it counts, they're there for each other. It's a shame that we'll likely never see all four together again, as their interaction proved quite compelling.On the side of the bad guys, there's the masked 'Taskmaster' who can mimic the Avengers fighting styles, hence why we see the use of a shield and bow/arrows among other fighting moves. Whilst able to hold her own, the first face-off between Taskmaster and Natasha shows that she's not some unbeatable 'perfect' fighter, but she uses her smarts and her brains over brawn is what sets her apart from all the characters that rely on muscle. If there's one letdown in the film, it's Ray Winstone's Dreykov, but it's kind of worth him being so pathetic a human being just to see Natasha outsmart him and smiling more than I think we've ever seen her smile before.This is a more 'intimate' MCU film, and as such the climax may not be quite what some were expecting/hoping for, but it's still satisfying because of what it means for Natasha, Yelena and all the other Widows. As for any 'unbelievable' elements in the film...at this point, if you're willing to accept things like helicarriers and talking raccoons/trees, then having a problem with the 'fantastical' elements here seems a bit hypocritical. It's not just the acting, action, humour, and music that the film has going for it, but also the way it *looks*. Cate Shortland should be commended for her directing, as there are some truly great/beautiful shots throughout, the fights are never confusing and the effects on display are used sparingly, but really well. All three lead actresses look smashing in their costumes (Scarlett proves that whether she's wearing black or white, she looks good in ANYTHING). David Harbour? Not so much.While some believe 'it's all downhill' after Endgame, I personally feel it's actually the opposite. With a certain character no longer hogging all the focus/screentime, we can now focus on other characters who deserve to have their stories told. This is one such instance. The main disappointment is that this is, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett Johansson's/Natasha Romanoff's swansong. While I would've liked to have seen more films with the sisters together, at least ScarJo can rest assured that the mantle of Black Widow will be in safe hands with Florence Pugh (assuming, of course, she takes over the role, though they'd be foolish not to see what a stand-out she was here and feature her in future MCU projects. The post-credits scene suggests she will be, but the conflict it sets up could be resolved with a simple conversation between her character and the target she's sent after). So long, Natasha. Thanks for all the crotch-throat grabs. Fade to black, Widow."
2973,6,"Red Guardian The best of the movie, the character and the actor playing Red Guardian. For the rest very mediocre. The previous main Marvel films like Avengers, Capt America, Ironman, what a quality compared to this film and current series."
2974,8,"Yes. Omg yes. Maybe one of my favorite Marvel movies. Long overdue yet worth the wait. Had the theater silent in the second half of the movie. Funny, action packed, touching in more ways than one. Natasha Romanoff will be dearly missed in the MCU. What a send off. Please see this movie and ignore bad reviews."
2975,9,"Definitely the MCU's Could Have Been James Bond Franchise This film blew my expectations, to be honest my only two issues with this film is that the real villain is very talked about but only seen for 15 minutes at the end, and that this film should have been swapped with Captain Marvel. I loved Captain Marvel, but I feel that film would have had more significance starting Phase 4 and Black Widow being before Infinity War or Endgame. But other than those this film is very much like a James Bond or Jason Bourne film. I love the spy espionage feel to the story and is definitely showing that Marvel's Phase 4 is really going to be taking us all over the spectrum of entertainment. The acting never falls flat, the comedy is strong, but still holds great moments uninterrupted by the comedy. I cried and laughed. This is a great must watch, but for newer MCU viewers I watch this movie either after Civil War or before Infinity War."
2976,4,"Another marvel movie with nothing to remember afterwards. So to start of, i wouldn't say the movie is particular bad or good, it is ""ok"". The Question now becomes , is ""ok"" enough for a 200 million dollar disney production that plays out like it was made for a 4 part series on Disney+ not a movie.My Answer would be: ""not really"".The Movie started abit slow and the story was not all that interesting. The VfX as usual in the MCU movies was good, but you know it will be and expect that. In a time where you have shows / movies with similiar production value on netflix and disney+ with no extra cost ( This movie costs 30 USD in addition to the subscription on disney+) this just falls short for me.To the People that rated this movie 8 or higher i ask, would you have rated it as high if you strip out the marvel name and rename the characters - with no change to story or writing or anything but the names. I truly don't think so.If they had made this into a 4 - 8 Part show on Disney plus i wouldn probably say: ""Ok, its not worse than ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"", but also not better."" But as a Movie it just falls short for me as it is."
2977,9,"Good movie Good movie; doesn't exaggerate Russian culture, but gets into stereotypes a little. Great acting."
2978,8,"finally Finally Black Widow headlines the theaters! I was so excited for this movie, and the wait is finally over!One of my biggest questions I wanted answered going into this movie was where this falls in the MCU timeline. I was really hoping to see Budapest and its plot because it was referenced in previous MCU films (especially between Black Widow and Hawkeye), but it was never shown. I was really intrigued to see the beginning of their relationship. Sadly though, it was still only referenced. Instead, this primarily takes place directly after the events of Captain America: Civil War where Black Widow turned on Black Panther at the airport.Taskmaster and Red Guardian were two new characters introduced to the audience; however, I really wish that Marvel had given both characters a stronger role and presence in the movie. Taskmaster had a few scenes where I reacted with a jaw dropping ""what just happened""; Taskmaster knew how to make an entrance. Red Guardian spent too much time reminiscing about his time fighting Captain America in the 80s. But he was still on ice in that time so who was Red Guardian really talking about. When another inmate questioned Red Guardian's claims, he responded by breaking his arm! It made me think that what are the chances that Red Guardian was possibly from an alternate timeline; it is farfetched, but it is still possible.One thing that I really enjoyed and appreciated about this movie was the plot. It did not have the traditional Marvel superhero movie plot. Black Widow was action packed, and I would even argue it was greater than previously produced movies. The only ""dry"" moment of the movie for me was about 10-15 minutes right in the middle. The pace of the plot had significantly decreased in comparison to the rest of the movie.Another aspect of the movie I really enjoyed was Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena Belova. Her character was built in a way that can carry on the Black Widow name in the future, hopefully.Black Widow is a movie that is long overdue. She carried the MCU since her debut in Iron Man 2. As Thor said in Ragnarok, ""respectful appreciation, I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors"". When thinking of that, Black Widow is at the top of the list."
2979,10,"Everyone Needs To See Black Widow!!! I watched Black Widow in 3D! After, waiting over 400 days, and 3 movie delays, the movie was amazing!!! It was worth the wait."
2980,8,"Another Good Marvel Flick I really enjoyed this movie. It had everything a marvel movie usually has, good action, good comedic moments and some good acting scenes. But this one I noticed was more dark tone when I say this I mean there was a few scenes that I watched and wouldn't let my kids watch until older. But not to get off topic, Scarlett was amazing as usual and the other lead characters were great! I hope we get to see them again soon."
2981,10,"See if for yourself! Ignore the bad reviews and see the movie for yourself! Wildly entertaining and the female lead is done right because she isn't constantly focusing on her gender. I am a woman and I despise when movies lean too heavily into ""I'm a woman but I can do this too!"" People in these reviews have already made their minds up before even seeing the movie. I'll agree Taskmaster was a little disappointing but definitely not a deal breaker because that was the only downfall of the movie. Overall, it was awesome!"
2982,7,"Great visual effects! I went to see this movie with cool expectations of fight scenes and visual effects, it doesn't let you down, having a bonus seeing it in IMAX format, felt like your flying in some scenes! Plot wise, it's interesting, but I'm not getting full connection to it, Characterization needs to be more polished or some more background. Overall, it's a good movie to see."
2983,6,"An ok send off to one of the MCU's best characters Black Widow harkens back to the phase 1 days of the MCU, delivering a more contained epilogue to Natasha's story, carried by a very strong supporting cast."
2984,6,"It was vaguely okay A little disappointed I was hoping for a more serious spy, espionage action thriller close to a Jason Bourne type film. But what I saw was a barely average film with some decent punchlines and mediocre action sequences. Expected a richer story from a Titan studio like marvel."
2985,7,"Awesome action, Florence Pugh steals the show, and a decent film in the mcu series. 3.5 out of 5 stars.Black Widow is a pretty fair superhero film that gives Scarlett Johansson her own film. Giving some backstory to the character and a setting that takes place after Captain America Civil War. Before the character faces her fate. Its a in between installment which adds a few new characters additions and some exciting action sequences. I did find the plot to be weak and a underdeveloped villain.What worked? It was great to see a little backstory of Black Widow. The opening scene with Natasha and her sister being little with the family. Only to be separated. The girls are trained to be super assassins through a Russian experimental training. The film feels more like an esponiage action movie than a superhero. With skilled assassins that are controlled. Natasha and her sister goal through the movie is to go after the leader of the program to kill him. Which is also the weakest part of the movie is the plot.The action sequences are awesome. It has chases. Fighting. And aerial combat as characters are free falling and fighting at the same time. And a snow setting prison compound that has an avalanche crashing down.The cast ensemble is also good. Scarlett Johanson is great. Florence Pugh stole the spotlight playing her sister. A character who always wanted to have a normal life and a family but all is stripped away during there childhood. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz were great playing there parents.What did not work?The pacing of the film. The first hour is fast moving with chases and action set pieces back to back. After the family gets together. Things slow down and loses its steam. Until the climax comes around. The film also plays itself seriously compared to other mcu films which had the fun tone.I also found the villain Taskmaster to be underdeveloped. It gives a challenge to Natasha and her sister. As it chases them down through a tank vehicle or when he is on foot. It mimicks there combat style. Very brief story goes behind Taskmaster. That character just feels like it is there to give reason behind all the action. Dreykov played by Ray Winstone who is another bad guy behind the red room experiment is kind of tedious as the villain.Overall, Black Widow is a fair entry in the mcu. It has great action sequences but slow moving direction and a forgotten villain that may bring down the film. Florence Pugh and other characters are fun additions.There is one post credit scene that is worth staying."
2986,8,"A lot better than expected I wasn't expecting much going into the movie and female-led movies have never done well. Black Widow is the exemption so far. They did it right. They didn't overpower the women in the movie. They didn't make them superior to men. You know, kinda like that God awful Harley Quinn & The Birds of Prey movie last year.The one complaint about this movie is that they made Task Master a woman. That is the one complaint. In every other media he is in, he is a man. That was a big swing and a miss on Marvel's part.Overall, good but not great movie! Definitely recommend spending the $10 a ticket you spend on the movie."
2987,6,"Widows sting is strong but not as deadly Ok overall it was decent but I expected the movie to be a little better.Good Stuff Action scenes Stand out Character performances (Yelena, Red Guardian) Fight Choreography Natashas Family dynamicsNot so great stuff Taskmaster throw away character (no substance) Final villain Red room or lack of Natasha Training Flashbacks Natasha sidelined by other charactersThe biggest disappointment for me was Taskmaster. When you see it you will know what I'm talking about. The movie is still great but can be debated. If you are a hardcore comic book purist then you might not like this movie as much. The movie is still enjoyable, full of action and worth the admission. I just didn't like the direction they took with that particular character. Finally the final villian was forgettable. Taskmaster future in the MCU is questionable.Could've used some extra scenes or flash backs of Natasha training in the Red Room."
2988,7,"Generic Action movie carried by great actors! This movie starts off strong with a compelling introduction that shows promise for the main characters but don't let that fool you into thinking this will be more than another average marvel action movie. The action is over the top and bogged by cgi. All the villains are immediately forgettable. And the humor is a constant hit or miss. All said, this movie does have an emotional core with the family that sustains in scenes throughout. Dan Harmon and Florence Pugh act very well and bring a lot of charm in the movie. Would recommend but don't have high expectations for Marvel's long overdue solo film."
2989,6,"Back in Black I have noticed that this movie is getting a lot of bad press. After seeing the trailer, so long ago, I had my doubts about this film - especially since Marvel is making a lot of recent garbage.This movie will surprise you. While it is not going to be considered in the upper echelon of Marvel movies; it falls in the middle of the pack. No where near as bad as Captain Marvel or Black Panther.There are flaws in the movie, but they do not tear it down to a bad level - they just keep it from rising to a better rating.Scarlett. Johansson had always been a rather average performer. Another reason to doubt this film. The surrounding cast pushes the film ahead and makes it work.Is it anything new? No - and in the beginning the same old car/motorcycle chase you have seen over and over makes you think that the film would crash. Once the film gets the crew (the four characters from the first ten minutes) back together is when the film becomes interesting.The one glaring weakness was the portrayal of Taskmaster. He was always a Captain America antagonist for one thing - but that doesn't take away. The problem is the creation of Taskmaster in the film - it was just ridiculous.Good movie - not great - but worth watching."
2990,6,"FP and DH carried this movie Florence Pugh carried this movie, her and David Harbour laid down some seriously good comedic moments. The action was as over the top as any other marvel movie so on brand there. The acting was okay and CGI was expectedly good. It felt like Johansson took a back seat to other characters which was disappointing."
2991,10,"Ignore the bad reviews This was really fun. Frances Pugh was SUPPOSED to carry the movie as she is in the new Hawkeye series this year. It was fun to see one of the human superheros in action, no special powers. It is like Jason Bourne which is great. I'm glad we didn't spend time watching her be tortured as a child. Very exciting and heartwarming at the same time. No avenger cameos to detract from the film. It's fun and different."
2992,8,Great movie It's a great movie! Loved the callbacks from different movies. Florence Pugh's character shines through out the movie. There are good action pieces too. End credit scene is also insane!
2993,9,"Marvel's espionage thriller A very entertaining film, this one tackles the espionage thriller genre - think James Bond or Jason Bourne. (That's a perfect fit for Black Widow, who after all is Marvel's super spy, not a true super-powered individual.) With this choice comes some changes from the normal Marvel formula - instead of punching super-bad guys all film, Natasha is chasing a mystery. There's plenty of action, but also drama, twists, and gadgets to keep the story moving along. If you come in expecting it to be an Avengers-type punch-up between Black Widow and the Taskmaster, you may be disappointed. But if you sit back and let the story unfold, it's a good one - with some great performances (especially by Pugh) - and enough adrenaline to make the 2 hours go by fast!"
2994,7,"Action and Emotion Some flash backs, family ties, new characters, a tidy plot, and good execution, this film is a welcome and overdue addition to the MCU."
2995,6,"Not bad, not bad at all With excellent performances and some great emotional depth, Black Widow may prove to be a bit uneven with it's execution towards the end- but it still manages to be a solidly fun and impactful superhero journey. To be honest, I expected rather little from this film. Considering all that's happened in the MCU recently with her character, and it's incredibly delayed release, I felt like the time had passed for a Black Widow solo film. Surprisingly though, I found myself quite entertained and moved by some of the moments of the film, and although it wasn't great, it did prove to be better than I had anticipated. By far the best thing about the film is Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena, aka Natasha's sister. Through her character we get a greater depth not only into a magnificently written character, but also the world of Natasha herself, and the pains that have burdened each of them for a long time. Strangely enough, in this marvel movie, by far the best moments are when it slows down and takes a time to tell it's story- as well as clear up the emotional depth each character has had to deal with. The action scenes are decent, nothing too special. I adore the costumes and really liked the films score. Towards the final act of the film, we seen to have a deterioration in quality though- it being just a bit too convoluted to have as much fun or as much as an impact as it could have had. In the end, I enjoyed Black Widow, it has its problems and it could have been better, but it also was much more refreshing than I anticipated- and that for me is a win alone.My Rating: 7.7/10."
2996,8,"So good to be back to the theaters for a good movie This was the 4th movie I saw in a theater since the pandemic began and it was the only one I actually enjoyed. Thanks Marvel, we've missed you.Although packed with CGI and unrealistic chasing/fighting scenes typical of Marvel movies, it's tone is more of a spy movie -like a 007 or Bourne- than a super hero movie and that was a good change of pace.I agree with some reviewers that, amid the whole MCU saga it may feel pointless since it almost doesn't connect to anything- the post credit scene being most important in that aspect than the whole movie- and the character is already dead ""presently"" so it may feel hard to really care about the story. But as a stand alone action spy movie it works pretty well."
2997,8,"The atmosphere was fitting. To start on a good note, I really liked the atmosphere of the movie and the locations it was filmed in were chosen wisely.The supporting cast of the movie came through with some very good performances. Both Florence Pugh and David Harbour were extremely memorable and were one of the biggest strengths of this movie. Johansson also did her thing.Overall I found the first half of the movie (the set up) stronger than the second one. The villain and the ending fell a little flat to me but I wouldn't say that it was too bad. It's just that it didn't fully utilize its potential.I actually really liked the idea of the plot and it felt like it was up my alley but some of the execution could have been better.Overall I think Black Widows is worth a watch for any Marvel fan but it's far from the best Marvel movie. The supporting cast did an amazing job though.7.5/10."
2998,10,"This is by far best marvel movie The acting, the action, the costumes, the plot... this movie is a total masterpiece. Honestly I wish it was longer but still it was so good. Black widow deserves a second movie."
2999,10,"Good movie It was good, lots of action, I don't know where they are heading with that end credits, but stick around till the end."
3000,9,"Marvel Can Do No Wrong! I should start by saying ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is my favorite MCU film and maybe that's why I enjoyed ""Black Widow"" so much. It very much has a ""Winter Soldier"" vibe to it and gives a political thriller type origin story for Natasha. The entire cast gives a great performance and the film gives us some of the best action scenes in the MCU to date. Towards the third act it becomes less Natasha's story and more setting up the possible future Black Widow character arc. It's a stand alone film that doesn't provide a huge amount of fan service like previous MCU films. I personally would have liked to see more flashbacks about Budapest or more storytelling connecting the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs. The film succeeds without diving too much into either besides short mentions. My only complaint is the use of Taskmaster feels like the use of The Mandarin in Iron Man 3. Taskmaster is an iconic comic book character that deserves better and I hope Marvel better uses the character in future installments. It be very easy for someone else to get their hands on the suit and redeem the character. It's a great film and the post credit scene sets us up nicely for the upcoming Hawkeye series. Keep up the great work Marvel!"
3001,9,"Did not disappoint! Don't listen to the bad reviews. Not sure why people are so critical. When I went to see this, I knew the least about Black Widow. Loved the back story, drama, action and comedy. My fav character was the father. He was a hoot! PS. Watch for the clip after the closing credits!"
3002,6,"Enjoyable enough, but degrades into more 'classic' Marvel shlock. Positives: Lets start there, why not.So This film feels like it is held together on the performances of Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh and Dave Harbour - the latter two especially.The dynamic of their mismatched 'family' is fun to watch, and actually has a lot of heart. Luckily, this runs throughout the whole film, because without it, I think it'd be completely forgettable.The opening is fantastic, and immediately gave me Winter Soldier vibes. Safe to say, I was excited for a darker spy/espionage movie...The cons: ...Sadly that movie never came.What starts great, quickly descends into stock standard Marvel-style drivel. The plot is fairly predictable, and the characters 'plans' are incredible dumb.Some of the action scenes are okay, but most are ruined with quick cuts that make everything feel like watching marbles going through a blender.Worst still, is the total underutilization of the characters abilities.At one stage we're told Pughs character is the best assassin in the world ...but we're never shown that?We're told Black Widow is the best spy in the world... but she doesn't do any spy work throughout the film?Worst yet, they had Taskmaster - a character with such an amazing and formidable ability, but they squander it for stock standard fight scenes we've scene a million times.Overall: Like I say, It's enjoyable enough to warrant a watch, but it could have been so much more with a little bit of competence."
3003,7,"Great movie to go return for to the cinema I just came home from my local cinema. Black Widow was the perfect film to go back to the cinema after more than a year. Natasha was portrayed dignified, brave and strong. Recommend y'all to watch it !!Humorous, nice acting, good script and healthy pace.There are some awesome camera shots in different countries.It was so nice to be in a cinema again after a year, and Black Widow is the perfect movie to start again.The character development of Natasha started from Iron Man 2 to having her own movie. They did a great job to finish her story on screen.The fight scenes were a bit off for my taste, but I do prefer Easter fight scenes and stunts more, but still entertaining and far from embarrassing.I really can't believe those negative critics. The movie was pushed for over a year due to pandemic and finally its there. Support your local cinemas to enjoy movies like Black Widow and have a nice time."
3004,6,"Weakest MCU film yet Black Widow is the weakest MCU film yet but it's still good overall despite its multiple problems which are common with this franchise.It's overuses CG that often looks weak and is very noticeable. The villains are some of the worst in the MCU, especially Taskmaster who is massively underutilized and completely forgettable. The humour, whilst competent, constantly undermines the more emotional moments with frustrating results. The action sequences are competent but nothing more.However, Scarlett Johansson gives a reliably great performance and Florence Pugh is definitely the standout. David Harbour, Rachel Weisz and O. T. Fagbenle are all really good. The opening is really strong, surprisingly dark and mature and it's well paced. The music by Lorne Balfe is also really good."
3005,10,Brilliant This movie was very moving and that post credit scene was everything!
3006,9,"Not worth the wait... but worth a watch Its much better than Falcon & winter soldier, Loki and Captain Marvel. But, not as good as Avengers or Thor Ragnarok. Action is awesome, slightly dull in some slo-mo. Family reunion piece is most disappointing. Florence & Rachel are the shining stars. Scarlet is a star. Cap, Thor, Stark are name-dropped every 10 minutes. But, overall a good entertainer... go for it!"
3007,7,"It Was All In The Trailers This movie is very fun but seems quite lacking at times. Its got some great and inventive action, but most of it was shown in the trailers."
3008,10,Way above my expectations If you want me to be honest yes I had no expectations. I did think that the movie was going to suck. But guess what this movie took up the clutch of my seat the whole movie. Filled with gr8 action scenes with humour. Honestly loved it so much. Cant wait for more projects from MS like this soon!!!👻
3009,10,"A worthy origin movie I loved this. From the opening sequence it was full of action but with poignant moments that bring a greater understanding of Natashas back story. We have waited so long for a black widow origins films and this really was brilliant, hints of Jason Bourne in the action sequences which is no bad thing!I'm only sad that they didn't cover Budapest in more detail, I'd have liked to see how Nat and Hawkeye met. Hoping that we get to see another instalment of black widows past before they move on to the next phase."
3010,8,"Black Widow beautifully honors the iconic Natasha Romanoff, who finally receives the respectful, worthy solo film that her unforgettable legacy always deserved. If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Black Widow beautifully honors the iconic Natasha Romanoff, who finally receives the respectful, worthy solo film that her unforgettable legacy always deserved. Cate Shortland and Eric Pearson put together an MCU installment that doesn't really compare to any of the other origin flicks, profoundly examining the protagonist's dark past and her complex ""family"" through distinctly compelling storytelling. Scarlett Johansson shines one last time, interpreting the most impactful role of her career, but Florence Pugh comes close to stealing the spotlight by giving an absolutely phenomenal display. Boasting highly entertaining, mostly well-filmed action sequences, the main narrative follows a path with no surprises, as well as a generic villain, but the emotionally investing storylines regarding Natasha's personal motivations and Yelena's complex feelings keep the film remarkably captivating. The ending is as satisfying as I could have ever wished for. A loving farewell to a hero that inspired millions of viewers.""Rating: A-"
3011,5,"Not great, not awful Usually I'm fairly loyal to the standalone MCU offerings but I can't say I really enjoyed this. No issue with Scarlett or Florence, their scenes were engaging enough and Rachel Weisz was passable. Not so David Harbour as a super soldier. Add Ray Winstone into the mix with his ""bet365"" Russian accent and I'm undecided between hilarious or tragic.The plot was mediocre and I won't be watching again."
3012,8,"Black Widow Aims High Black Widow is a welcome return to the big screen for the MCU. It's one of the more fast paced and easy to follow MCU adventures and delivers a satisfying epilogue to Scarlett Johansson's, 11 year long role as Black Widow, after her death in Endgame. In this movie, we get a closer look into the black widow programme and what we learn is very interesting. Florence Pugh delivers a fantastic performance as Yellana, with Johannson delivering as well in the lead role. David Harbour is also a highlight playing Captain America, if he were a pathetic loser. In regards to action, this movie delivers with several exciting action sequences and fight scenes. However, this film really delivers with the story, providing an emotionally investing, character driven family drama, as well as a thrilling spy thriller. I definitely recommend watching this movie on the big screen, if you can. It's a non stop thrill ride from start to finish."
3013,8,Black widow is a touching send off to one of marvels best female characters This entry to the mcu is not perfect and does have some glaring issues one of which is taskmaster. However this film has made me laugh more than any other MCU project and has some very strong preformances from Scar jo and Pugh. Pugh is very good and very funny. The action in this film is very raw in the first two acts and the film as a whole is not scared to go dark for example the opening credits. This film is a great entry into the MCU but again is not for everyone and taskmaster films will be angry. However its a great watch.
3014,8,"Great welcome back to MCU on the big screen Great film was everything a black widow movie should be, the main criticism I have is , this should have been released/made before infinity war and endgame. Very well connected tho! Definitely shouldn't of taken 11 years to get out, it's fun and Johanson is awesome."
3015,7,"A welcome return Good movie, some great set pieces. Some parts may drag on multiple viewings but all in an enjoyable experience."
3016,6,"An Enjoyable Mixed Bag I just got out of Black WidowI have mixed views on this one. It's not down the bottom end of the MCU movies like Ultron, Iron Man 3 and Thor 2!! But it's nowhere near to top end either.The beginning/opening credits was pretty good at making us care about this family.Although some times the action sequences were so over the top, it was veering into F&F territory and that took me out of the chase sequencesSome moments could have been played dark and dramatically, and I think it would have elevated the movie, but they are played for laughs in the MCU.Scarlet Johansson is as reliable as always in the role of Natasha Romanov, and I really liked Florence Pugh as her sister, but the stand out for me was David Harbour, he isn't given much to do, be here steals the show when he is on screen.Task Master is a huge disappointment. Do not read the names in the opening credits, as movie fans should recognise the name, like I did and when something happens, you realise who it is very easily."
3017,7,"Good, but atypical for Marvel While being pursued by Ross after the events of Civil War, Natasha finds herself embroiled in a plot against the Red Room Widow programme from which she defected to SHIELD. This involves her getting re-entangled with the sleeper cell ""family"" with whom she spent her childhood in rural Ohio.ScarJo's long-awaited solo outing becomes the most atypical MCU movie of all, and I suspect it will disappoint a lot of people for reasons I will get to.The extensive delay in its appearance due to Covid (and its divided delivery between cinemas and Disney streaming) hasn't helped. But the big thing (to me, at least) is that it doesn't really feel like a MCU movie. I know that sounds improbable when you consider the mixed bag making up the couple of dozen movies so far, but this one felt like a spy movie dark in tone which, despite a moderate amount of MCU namedropping, was more Bond/Bourne than Marvel.The story was fine, and we found out more about Natasha's origin (although we didn't learn much about Budapest). ScarJo was fine and Florence Pugh was outstanding as her ""sister"" Yelena: the chemistry between them was wonderful. Rachel Weisz, never a favourite of mine, was good, too.David Harbour as Red Guardian was merely OK, and the wonderful Ray Winstone disappointed. I got the impression hardly bothered - one for the pension fund, Ray. And Olga Kurylenko was wasted.Plus there were a lot of directorial choices which I thought could have been better, especially the use of handheld shots where less wobble would have been welcome. And I watched it in 3D on a screen on which, even without glasses, it was conspicuously darker than the trailer had been.The action was good and the post-credits scene pleased. This is a good, but flawed, film, and I think it's biggest problem is likely to be that what it delivers, despite its quality, is likely to fail to match the expectations of its audience."
3018,7,"Great characters dynamic and a good MCU thriller As far as MCU movies go, this was a very streamlined one, in the spirit of Winter Soldier. Scarlett portrays Natasha as a multidimensional superhero caught in between two families, and even if Florence Pugh is the MVP, their sisterly bond is a great exchange of torch.This movie might have been slightly late, but it's a good send off for Natasha Romanoff. It was emotional, funny, exciting and the CGI was better than expected (especially when it comes to aerial battles and gymnastics).I do believe Taskmaster was underutilised as a villain with a lot of skills, but I appreciate the movie focused so much on the family and trauma. Looking forward to Yelena becoming a part of the MCU!"
3019,5,"Mid-teir movie Wasn't worth the 2 year wait, or the multiple delays.The story was messy and felt as though it has suffered alot of last minute re-writes, the main villain of the movie didn't really feel like much of a pay off and the taskmaster was boring.The film started off strong and kind of just fell apart as it progressed."
3020,10,"Very good movie...✔ Get ready to watch an adrenaline-filled movie that will control your heartbeat with its impressive story, visual effects, and wonderful performances of the actors."
3021,5,"Pughs excellence couldn't save this dull affair After the appalling FATWS tv series and mess of a finale in Wandavision I had high hopes Black Widow would be a return to form or least be a half decent affair, sadly it was not to be! When taskmaster was announced as the villain I couldn't help but be excited yet turned out to be yet another pointless villain. It's only just over 2 hours long which is average for a movie now yet somehow it feels too long, the action is just ok, the acting is largely passable apart from Pugh who is outstanding steals literally every single scene she's in but for me she was the only highlight of the whole film.I'm becoming nervous for the marvel future for the first time. They need to freshen up their approach."
3022,10,AMAZING I have never thought it would be this GOOD!!!Its definitely better than i expected.
3023,6,"Disappointing. To keep this review short and straight to the point, Black Widow was a disappointing movie. The whole plot and story seemed very unnecessary. It was way too long and had too much pointless dialogue. It felt like they were trying to be funny at times but they weren't. The Characters they introduced (Yelena and Red Guardian) were probably the best part about the movie.Overall this movie serves no purpose in the future of the MCU. It felt a bit forced and the end result was disappointing."
3024,9,"An Awesome Return For The MCU After countless delays we finally get another MCU film on the big screen on for the first time in two years.The Good- The cast in here is amazing, Scarlet Johansen has never been better in this role than she is here and I love the relationship which she forms with her family. David Harbour and Florence Pugh absolutely run the show here and honestly I wish that they were introduced earlier. This film is all about family and where Black Widow came from and honestly I love that aspect and what they were able to do with it all. The action is filmed in a way in which I really love and is a film that just keeps going and never has a slow moment.The Bad- I wish it came out after Civil War instead of Endgame. I also didn't like Taskmaster, he just felt like a throwaway character compared to how big of a character he is in the comics. In the final battle a lot of the special effects just looked chap or you can tell straight away that it is green screened. Now these are only small issues I had with the film and didn't take away from any enjoyment from the film.Overall Thoughts- Cate Shortland made an almost perfect Black Widow film with amazing performances, wonderful action I just wished it came out a couple of years earlier. Overall I'm going to give 'Black Widow' a 9/10."
3025,8,"Twisted Love/Family. Dark memories. New pains. Rebirth. A (tragic) 'family' story to the full extent ; as well as a dark (but entertaining) action-adventure-thriller puzzle piece to add to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.A certain amount of people think that it's useless to tell prequel (or what happened before this or that) stories when you already know how the whole thing is gonna end anyway ; in particular when it comes to stories involving heroes, because it automatically diminishes the stakes. But like the famous quotes says : ""It isn't the destination that matters, but the journey"". Some people might not enjoy this movie in spite of that, but the truth is that it adds a lot of layers to this mysterious Black Widow Program + everything surrounding the 'Red Room' and all these dark secret projects, with everything that it impacts on a greater scale... And it obviously adds a huge deal to Natasha Romanoff's story, her life/journey, and the human being behind the Avenger... That's the purpose of a standalone MCU movie ? Yes, and it did the job well !Now, about the experience of the movie itself. The upset feelings between the main 'players' logically bring a lot of depth to the characters involved in this story, their complicated/messed-up relationships and how all these souls have been tormented since ages throughout all this dark journey they've had to endure... The movie solidifies Natasha's choices & trajectory since this dark past, while also healing many important wounds in the process (not just hers)... It adds tasty new characters and a whole new 'mythology' to the MCU, one that is grounded in a spy/secret world...The way the movie is directed and cut, cleverly resonates with the specific emotions the director wants you to feel... It is well paced and well crafted in that sense, because every scene or sequence feels and looks organic with what it's telling you, you then feel like being a part of it.The action set pieces -as always with the MCU- are high level. And as expected for a Black Widow movie, the fight scenes strike hard ! Visually, it's always very catchy, smooth and beautifully staged. You never get lost in the action because the cinematography of the whole movie is masterclass. A specific mention to the use of light and contrasts, because it just adds this delicious icing over the whole movie (certain scenes are true eye candies)... And the whole score/soundtrack must not be overlooked ; certain tracks are fantastic, powerful, epic...A very good addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has a lot of heart and tells a true 'self-sufficent' standalone story, while being useful to the bigger picture , it grabs you nicely from the first to the last minute and has some really strong moments. All hail to Scarlett Johansson, for everything she has brought to this character, with an obvious love, passion, and complete dedication to this role."
3026,8,"Amazing performance from Scarlett Johansson I went to the Movies cinema in Dundrum Dublin to watch this movie, and I really enjoyed it.I still prefer Loki, Endgame, Spider-Man 2 to this but this movie is close to top 5-10."
3027,5,Unable to view reviews Reviews not appearing? I'm only assuming it's because it's a female led movie and they're not allowing bad reviews for that sole reason 😂😂 pathetic.
3028,10,"Welcome Back MCU Loved it and met all expectations after a two-year theatrical absence. Great 'stand alone' movie with some Winter Soldier and Civil War Vibes, which makes sense. I almost expected Dominic Torreto to show up with how many times 'Family' was mentioned.Stand out performance of the movie has to be Florence. Looking forward to the new 'widow' going forward."
3029,8,"A new level for Marvel This story is about Natasha's struggle with her past after she was left alone after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"". And it was on a new level for Marvel.This movie is like a typical superhero movie. Unrealistic scenes where the main characters fall from several floors and remain healthy and others. But I can't complain about it, because I think it's genre features. I want to note the attempts at jokes and humor, which were even successful. I also want to note the cool special effects and operators' job. As they say, fire was fire. And about the plot: I can say that the interactions of Natasha, Elena and their parents, I think, were quite complex and quite interesting. Elena is a very interesting character to get acquainted with her closer in the following projects. But the main antagonist has a bit vague motives.In conclusion: the first Marvel movie in a long time came out on the big screens with great dignity. I hope in the future we will see even more bright and impressive projects."
3030,6,"Enjoyable, but I Expected Much More Overall, the film was enjoyable and straight forward. Natasha's future death in End Game does not reduce the stakes of the plot at all. Her sister, Yelena's complex feelings is very well portrayed by Florence Pugh. She has to switch between innocence and vengence throughout the movie and the duality of her character is the best part of the film. The 'pose' joke also made me laugh. I like how the outfits of hers aren't hypersexualised for the male gaze. Taskmaster felt intimating and terrifying in the first two acts. Throughout the film, I'm constantly intrigued.However, the film fails to meet up my expectations. It is common knowledge that the movie should have released after Civil War. When we finally got her solo film, it even got delayed for a year. Additionally, it was marketed as a spy thriller action movie that resembles Captain America: the Winter Soldier (aka the best MCU film). Perhaps it's due to these premises that I had my hopes up. The plot was not memorable and the editing of the action scenes were sometimes confusing to me. The third act felt poorly designed and predictable. During the confrontation with the villain, there is an 'obstacle' that was dealt a minute later with a flashback scene, it seemed very straightforward and childish. Scenes with Black Widow's private contractor male friend also seemed pointless and dragged. It's another generic superhero film which the good guys beats the bad guys, and this brings nothing new to the table. A darke, serious tone would have suited Black Widow more. Sadly, she had a greater spotlight in Winter Soldier than in her own solo movie.Considering this is Scarlett Johansson's last Marvel movie, it is more focused on others rather than Black Widow herself. I expected a heartfelt, emotional ending but instead we got an abrupt one. I enjoyed the film, yet I recall myself walking out of the cinema with disappointment.6/10."
3031,8,"BACK FOR FUN! I have been awaiting a good reason to risk going to the cinema, and this movie is it!As a massive fan of the Avengers series, I was so excited. And I was not disappointed. It is a rollicking action packed big screen extravaganza!!Johansson and Pugh are fantastic. Great chemistry between them. David Harbour brings great comedic relief. Weisz is ok but less than convincing.I was expecting to be disappointed but I was delighted at the quality of script, acting and direction. Certainly up to Avenger's standards.Well done Warner!"
3032,8,Stands above the super hero genre Sound plot with superb acting/characterisation. Great to see a 'super hero' film that stands on its own merits. A very watchable action movie that showcases great acting talent alongside the cgi!
3033,10,Worth the wait I really loved it. The characters were amazing and so was the plot. Really added another layer to Nats character.
3034,1,"Watched this movie for free and still want my money back This movie sucks. Marvel ran out of ideas, too much talking, not enough action. The jokes don't land and the movie is dry from start to finish. Don't waste your money."
3035,8,"Black Widow The film starts by flashing back to 1995 when Natasha and Yelena her sister were very young. They end up being taken away from their parents and recruited by Russia. Flash forward to 2017 and Natasha is a wanted fugitive and on the run. She meets up with her sister played beautifully by Florence Pugh. Her and Scarlett have great action scenes and really fun interactions in the film. The action scenes are amazing, there is some funny dialogue and some really good character development. Yelena i think has the best arc in this film. Florence Pugh is a great actress, she can action, comedy and drama. Scarlett was great and so David Harbour and Rachel Weiz as Natasha and Yelena's parents. I highly recommend this film and think it is a great addition to the MCU."
3036,6,"Female directors are so hot right now Scarlett Johansson finally gets her own standalone Avenger film after appearing seven times before this as ""Black Widow"".Problem is not one other Avenger appears in person during the movie, they even joke about it in the script.Marvel has spoilt us in the past with the epic ""End Game"" and others that featured quite a few of our childhood Superheroes.However this film fills in some of the blanks about Natasha Romanoffs' quests in between the ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"" films in Marvels franchise.It touches on events in Budapest, but never fully answers fan boys & girl's questions.They even make light of the pronunciation of the city.As Natashas little sister, Yelena Belova, Florence Pugh is an absolute scene stealer.Rumours are she may even become the new Black Widow in future MCU films.One of the other standouts for me is ""Stranger Things"" hulking cop David Barbour as Alexei Sostakov otherwise known as Red Guardian in his third comic book character after ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Hellboy"" and he's brilliantly funny.Whereas Ray Winstone felt under-utilised as the Arch Nemesis, Dreykov, in this convoluted plot involving mind control for world domination.By the way there is no shortage of Oscar Winning actors in this saga thanks to William Hurt and Rachel Weisz and nominees Johansson and Pugh.""Black Widow"" has hints of ""Logan"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" and even James Bond with the snowbound Russian Gaol escape scene in its storyline.COVID-19 has claimed another release scheduling victim...it should have been on screens in May, 2020, but was delayed 3 times during the pandemic and now we finally start Phase 4 of the MCU even though Disney Plus have already aired ""WandaVision"" and ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"".Female directors are so hot right now so Aussie Cate Shortland is at the helm filming this production all over the world with locations in Norway, Hungry, the UK and of course the USA.It is a huge spectacle of a film shot in Panavision (anamorphic) with plenty of action, adventure and SciFi spliced in with choreographed fight scenes and bloody violence. (Rated M) As part of Marvels complete reversal of fortune (after nearly going bust years ago) ""Black Widow"" is the 24th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it bodes well for their future success because no one left the advance screening I attended until the Easter Egg was laid and the cinema lights came on."
3037,8,"First Mcu movie in two years ! A big disappointment or an outstanding solo film ? I really enjoyed this movie I saw it at an early screening last night I highly recommend you watch it but keep your expectations at mind that it's not including the big three ""wizards aliens and androids lol"" the film however suffers from a slight Villian problem which is rather lack luster and underwhelming however the performances and action set pieces will leave you exiting your theatre with a happy smile on your face,also don't forget to wait for a cheeky post credit scene hinting at the inclusion of a characters story in one of the upcoming Disney plus shows !!! Hope you guys enjoy the movie as I did."
3038,7,"I was expecting a biopic, surprised of the movie. Again that dream team made me completely wrong, for a lot of people i think. You expect something. It gives you that path then suddenly it goes way more far. It was a tenacious but yet fragile movie to disappoint me in the story but the main memorable scene isn't action or typical mcu moment but a more intimate thing. They took exactly the opposite of what i would have done or expected of that movie. Instead of showing, it's characters centered. To not spoil but yet guide you. Remember the Famous scene of the youth of romanof when she get manipulated in Age of Ultron. Well this movie is more close to the dialogue between bruce banner and Romanoff instead. It makes you think instead of seeing things. It's the imagination used most of the time. Appart that beginning. Well it could have been that intro a movie but it's an amazing opening and it throws you quickly on the excitement of a new adventure but with very familiar vibe.If Spider man far from home officially close the phases we know. I think in terms of release date, this one is legitimately ends the MCU phases started in 2008.Few long moment and sometimes out of the move but overall a great MCU movie again and actors top notch, fight scene are mindblowing and the effect teams did a brilliant jobs."
3039,8,"Great Movie, Wrong Timing...BUT First off, I'm still annoyed and always will be annoyed about how dirty they did Natasha Romanoff in waiting this long to give her a movie. She should have had the first female solo movie in the MCU, no doubt about that. No hate to Captain Marvel whatsoever, but Natasha has been an idol to so many female MCU fans long before this new modern wave of Marvel Movies. Not only that, but it's chronologically set after Civil War yet released after Endgame/Far From Home. Her character is dead and we all know it - people who don't particularly love the character, or anti-feminists, or casual Marvel fans, would most likely have little to zero interest in paying to watch a movie about a dead character.Nevertheless, the way they seemed to attempt to work around that fact is the focus on Florence Pugh's character, Yelena Belova. She's witty, snappy, uses humour as a defence mechanism but we see moments of vulnerability where she breaks down, letting the audience understand the psychological torment and familial deprivation she has gone through. It's done perfectly to contrast with the 'heart' Natasha has managed to keep - one that her undercover mother Melina Vostokoff, played by Rachel Weisz, refers to twice in the movie - clearly due to her reformed self having joined and found a family in the Avengers. The characterisation and sisterly relationship for the two Widows has been done perfectly, from the whistling at the start of the movie to the whistling in the post-credit scene at Natasha's grave.There are plenty - maybe too many - action scenes in the movie, but it doesn't take away or interrupt the flow of the plot. The pacing between action and storytelling/plot development is quite good, keeping you on your toes, making your tear up a little, pulling some laughter out of you. The CGI could have been better, but it wasn't as horrible as some people have been saying. The best part of the movie was by far the credits at the beginning. They were done so well to quickly but efficiently go through Natasha and Yelena's time in the Red Room as children. Really clever work, all down to the music choice as well.O. T. Fagbenle character, Rick Mason, was an odd choice to me. He didn't really add anything to the movie. What I seemed to understand about Rick's character is he's simply proof that Natasha has friends and is capable of holding friendships with people outside the Avengers - real friends, not just work buddies. I'm unsure where his character could go after this though. The hype with his character poster being released led to disappointment. Many theories spread, suggesting his character is likely to be Taskmaster, but the true reveal ended up being a little disappointing. However, it's important to note that this is only disappointing to Marvel Comics fans who have been excited for Taskmaster. There really is no way to go with this character anymore, and as the 'main' villain of the movie, Taskmaster had surprisingly little screen time. This issue with Taskmaster is what takes a star off this review.Red Guardian is the other star taken down. He had been turned into a joke character. I don't mind it, I found him quite funny and caring in his own way, someone lost in his glory days. His breaking out of prison scene was somewhat laughable: this super-soldier failing simple jumps, dropping because of a little electricity - we seem him casually arm wrestling and talking earlier while getting a tattoo, but he can't withstand a little shock? I'd hope we get to see him more in the future, and for his character to be taken more seriously - although I love the humour so some of it can stay - but I'm unsure how they'd do so. There were references to Captain America, Red Guardian suggesting he would have been more famous than him if he wasn't thrown in prison for years. And FATWS also tackled the hidden super-soldiers issue with Isaiah Bradley. Rumours of Captain America 4 had come out, so I wouldn't be disappointed if Red Guardian makes an appearance there.The post-credit scene was great, and thankfully it did do Natasha Romanoff justice. I'm glad we got to see her grave - although a funeral scene would be better. We rarely got to see the Avengers mourning her, but then again I guess this movie is showing her 'real' family, Yelena, mourning her. It sets up Yelena's character for the villain team Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is putting together - either Thunderbolt or Dark Avengers. Hawkeye is also revealed to be at 'fault' for Natasha's death, likely motivating Yelena to go after him. I'm unsure if we see her next in the Hawkeye show, or in Thunderbolts/Dark Avengers. But seeing her character as the villain, and ironically avenging Natasha's death just as she had mocked the Avengers for 'avenging' others, would be pretty interesting. I'd like to see Hawkeye converting her to the 'good' side though, just as he did with Natasha.Overall, I loved the movie, loved the casting, loved the way they handled and tackled the issue of wrong timing for this release. 100% watching is again and again to find more things to love :) Enjoy the movie and stay safe!"
3040,10,Great movie I thought this movie was absolutely enjoyable. I love every moment of it and especially the end. The effects were amazing and the fight scenes were smooth. It was also a very funny movie. I would definitely rank it as one of the top five marvel movies of all time. This was a joy!
3041,7,"Nice, but not marvelous Lovely movie, lots of good action sequences and of course a good origin story fitting in the mcu storyline."
3042,7,"It is almost okay At first it was very good, the introduction the family storyline and the task master first attack on black-widow was like wow😯, but later on task master became boring and just unorganized the fight were randomly cut, the second half was in general messy I didn't like the last part at all..I guess i expected more."
3043,10,"Black widow Just watched this in the cinema today and wow I cried and smiled so much, the ending was not expected and I'm exited to see what marvel brings next!!"
3044,7,"Black Widow entertain if not expect too much...Not bad Movie is first of all full of my favorite actors: Scarlett Johansson, Olga Kurylenko, Rachel Weisz, William Hurt and David Harbour. Natasha was always my favorite in avengers. I was sad after Endgame as many of us surely. Its very basic marvel action movie good as any Captain America. If you haven't seen avengers/captain america or its been long time. Then I recommend to watch them before see this or after.Scarlett don't even look any older. Action and story is good enough to entertain any marvel or action movie fans. Avengers: Endgame I give 9.0/10, but sadly this one I give 7/10. 7 is very basic points for marvel movie. Not bad, but masterpiece. I can recommend this to see in cinema. I am happy that Marvel studios return well in Covid-19 time to cinema. Can't wait what is coming next.I enjoyed Black Widow, even when it wasn't perfect. There is no as ""perfect"" movie. :) If you hate this, you are free to do so also."
3045,7,"Good Action Movie, but unrecognisable as a Marvel movie I know it's a stand alone movie, but that is a bit of an understatement, you simply don't need to have watched any other marvel movies to watch this. It's a typical good action movie, nothing bad, but nothing excellent. They tried very hard to inject some humour, but I feel as though the jokes were very rushed.One thing I was disappointed with especially with the extra time they have had due to the multiple Covid delays was the CGI, honestly the Falcon and Winter Soldier had better effects than this full blown movie.Good, but not for a marvel movie."
3046,8,This movie is Amazing The movie the Fans deserved and got and what black widow got. I can't see many people being disappointed with this movie as it's probably my favourite solo movie on the MCU. Very strong back story and how we learn about her past and family life and how she worked to where she got. Phenomenal acting from Florence Pugh and David harbour and of course Scarlett Johannson. Great action scenes and very smart writing.
3047,8,Better than I expected The story isn't preposterous.The action is good but not over the top.Its funny in places and poignant at times.It fits perfectly within its timeframe.I'm glad they made this movie.
3048,7,It was nice action movie with some family drama and comedy. I'm not that big fan of superhero movies at all.But I'm fan of both Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh.So that's main reason why i was interested in this one.Of course it wasn't that much acting heavy movie but they did both good performances. For me it was interesting to see them in this kinda roles.They did go greatly together with their unque deep voices.But movie itself was fun and enjoyable at most.Story was interesting.Atleast they didn't fight against some random aliens this time.Movie had some dramatic and comedic moments mixed with all that action.They were nice ones.That pose thing was fun little side thing in this. Little bit self irony from Marvel.Plot was little bit all over the placws at some moments.Movie wasn't anything too special but i was entertained.
3049,9,"Worthy of Gold Marvel status.. At last, a great blockbuster film. Black Widow definitely delivers, good story, great acting amazing action scenes. Florence Pugh was particularly good in making her character work brilliantly with Scarlett's leading role. No easy task, with one of the best actors in Hollywood. Black Widow is great all round entertainment, right up there with the best of the Marvel films. In fact a gold medal winner. Loved it, well done to the whole crew."
3050,10,"A tribute to the Black Widow No spoilers, I feel they did a good job with the backstory for the sisters, and it was refreshing to see Natasha outside of the Avengers Level Threats.8/10 for me, Only reason I give it 10/10 is to help the algorithm due to troll reviews, good score and the audio visuals were fantastic as per usual.I like this sort of Marvel movie, The Winter Solder is my favourite movie so it is natural that I would enjoy this one with it's Spy/James Bond style."
3051,9,"Winter Soldier meets Killing Eve This is a great movie. The plot is just decent, the villains are just alright and some jokes hit better than others, but the movie manages to be more than the sum of its parts; dark, often understated for a Marvel movie (though not the finale, for sure) and emotionally resonant in the moments where it tries. Think Winter Soldier but channelled through AMC's Killing Eve.The biggest plus by far is Florence Pugh, who manages to bring exactly the type of wild chaotic nonchallant energy to the movie that Jodie Cormer brings to Killing Eve's Villanelle. If she is indeed the the successor to Romanof's Black Widow, then I honestly can't wait to see her alongside the new and remaining Avengers cast."
3052,8,"Very entertaining Although Black Widow isn't the greatest movie of all time, it's very entertaining. The cast is wonderful, and the fighting has good choreography, but the middle portion of the movie drags the movie a bit. The worst thing about this movie is the villain."
3053,9,The respect Natasha Romanoff deserves The film that Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff deserves. Scarlett & Florence Pugh are utterly outstanding. Cate Shortland has made a truly beautiful film.
3054,9,"The epic movie Black Widow deserved What a return to cinemas for Marvel. The action was top-notch Marvel stuff with choreography and shooting much better than what the recent shows have been giving us. This movie made a change from the aliens from space and more crazy concepts in Marvel with a more grounded story. I was also lucky enough to see this in Imax and that made the experience even more epic. Finally, the story for Romanoff that she deserved and the backstory that has been hinted at for the past decade."
3055,10,Great movie more like a James Bond or borne A great movie great special twist villain A good back story to explain Natasha Wait till the end for a touching scene and set up till next story. I usually look for spoilers but don't for this as it make the story better.
3056,9,"great movie with strong performances Black widow had such a strong beginning. The first 10 minutes were an immediate slap in the face, with amazing editing like you've never seen before in the MCU. This movie stands out for its amazingly choreographed fight scenes that were even stronger than the ones in The Winter Soldier. I do have two things that i think could've been done better, but i'd still give it an 8.5/10!"
3057,10,"Epic on all levels. This movie is exactly what I wanted from a Black Widow solo adventure! The action is great, the cast is beyond perfect, and the story is dark and gritty.This is top tier Marvel!"
3058,10,"LOVED IT SO MUCH! It seems that some people are saying they didn't enjoy it, however in my opinion I found it so so good and I really enjoyed it. It has great characters, explains a lot about before infinity war and has a really good storyline about natashas background. I would definitely recommend that you watch!!"
3059,9,"Long overdue; worth the wait Strong storyline, good action and gives more depth to the Black Widow character that has been such a key piece of the MCU."
3060,8,"Black Widow Is An Event-Level Blockbuster That Shows Marvel At The Top Of Their Game After a delay lasting 19 months; the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has returned to the big screen with ""Black Widow"". The film takes place between ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Avengers: Infinity War""; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.This is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her ""family"" as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.Since Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.Natasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.Despite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha's insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.With Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former ""Father"" the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.What follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.Marvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.While many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.""Black Widow"" fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.From the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; ""Black Widow"" was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.4 stars out of 5."
3061,8,A great addition to the marvel universe Definitely worth the wait this film delves into Natasha's backstory and the sister wow I can wait to see more of her in up coming projects highly recommend you watch this film on the big screen if you can :)
3062,9,"Good Movie Good movie , shoulde have been right after Captain America Winter Soldier."
3063,10,I missed Marvel movies so much! This just after one viewing is one of my favorite Marvel movies! The action and fight scenes were really well done. Quite a few times it reminded me of how the Bourne series was shot. Marvel takes a dark turn with this story. It's probably the most realistically violent in the entire series. There is a lot of blood and broken bones. Which doesn't mean it skimps on the humor! Dave Harbour and Florence Puge are the stand out new additions in this. Scarlett really has embodied Natasha and goes out on a high.
3064,8,"Slow start, but stepped up eventually for a great big screen return The atmosphere in the cinema was great, everyone was ready to see some marvel action on the big screen after a 2 year absence. The film does drag a bit in the beginning I felt, but one scene eventually kicks off and the film shifts to drive. Finally we get some back story to Natasha, the story was obviously the core and mostly it was a throughly entertainment and in depth story about her family and past. Action as usual was great, and the use of sound in the Dolby atmos theatre was superb. Comedic moments were great in the film, audience had great reactions. The music was great as well. One particular choice of song stood out for me. (Watch and you'll find out I hope) I liked how you are able to connect to the characters more since it's a more grounded film. It's essentially a spy espionage film in a very well known universe. Only other issue I had with the film was the villain, wasn't very convincing and I would say opposed to being frightened for Natasha because of the villain. Great return for the big screen!"
3065,7,"Return to the MCU This is one of the most 'entertaining' movies I've seen in a while.The action scenes are fantastic in the movie. The hand-to-hand combat scenes, the chase scenes and the cgi-filled sequences. They are extremely well made and kind of brutal in some way.The characters are also great. S jo was great as black widow and the supporting characters were good as well. Interactions between them was fun to see, especially Johansson and Pugh's characters.The film has some flaws however. The middle portion of the movie drags a bit and the villain was kinda weak.It told a great storyline and it made me want to see more of the characters from the movie."
3066,9,"The Movie Black Widow deserved 10 years ago Finally Marvel gives Black Widow the movie she deserved so so long ago. After carrying the Marvel universe for years, especially the captain America films, Black Widow finally gets the power and background story we have been waiting for!This story has heart, humour, family and of course strong women with the no super power except being super bad ass. Florence was hilarious, soulful and I can not wait to see where the MCU continues her story, hopefully it is continued! Finally Marvel is presenting its women as leads and not as the side kick with boobs. Here's to more strong female leads with soul, humour and strength inside and out."
3067,8,"Better than expected! Never been a fan of black widow, always thought she was a bit of a joke since she doesn't actually have any super powers compared to the rest of the avengers so I was really surprised how good this was! Florence's performance was top notch, never imagined her in an action role (only previously seen her on midsommar) girl definitely has range! I hope there is a Black Widow 2 that centers around Florence's character (won't spoil the end) and what she does next. Definitely an asset to the marvel universe."
3068,8,"Marvel is back! As a Super marvel fan, I was lucky to get a screening of Black widow in IMax and all I can say is Wow!, I loved the fact that they pushed the PG 13 further, Without spoiling, The movie was darker than I imagined."
3069,7,"Well-Deserved & Packed With Emotions ""Black Widow"" is a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. Like us as fans, Scarlett Johansson has deserved it over the years and it's the only way to show it. Better late than never.The whole vibe is close to that of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", but I would not say that the overall idea is the same. The story is quite interesting and apart from Johansson's character, it also revolves around others that we will see in the future.This is not the traditional origin film, as the action takes place over several time periods, but on the other hand, it fills all the gaps and gives us the information we have needed for years.All the actors are great in their roles, but Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson stand out, mainly because of their relationship. There are a lot of emotional moments and honestly if the film had been released at the beginning of MCU, the effect would not be as strong as it is now, because over the years Natasha has become an important figure in this universe.Most of the dialogues are really strong meaningful, so you can realize, that over the years Natasha has become one of our favorite characters.The action is done with taste and you can realize by watching the fight choreography. There are several scenes between Natasha and Taskmaster, which are pure pleasure for the eye, although the Taskmaster story could be better.I hope that every true MCU fan will appreciate the movie in the right way - in the cinema. As every movie in the universe, there are some surprises, some of which are really nice."
