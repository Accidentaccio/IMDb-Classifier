0,7,Not As Good As The First Following the events of civil war Scott is in his final days of house arrest but just before he is released Hope and Hank need his help to save their wife and mother respectively.I would consider this a good movie but it does quite a few issues that make it not as enjoyable.The acting across the board is very good. Paul Rudd is great as Scott and just as comedic as before. Evangeline Lily and Michael Douglas are both great as their respective characters.One issue I had with this film is the fact that Scott isn't all that involved with the core plot. He does have a role to play but it doesn't have the same sort of impact that the plot had on him during the first.Hope on the other hand has a lot to do in this film and it is great to see her character grow and develop. We get to see her as the wasp and her action sequences are really creative and fun to watch.Ghost played by Hannah John-Kamen is the villain of this story. Her character has a really intriguing backstory and motive but the lack of development makes her character less compelling.The other villain in this film is Sonny Burch played by Walton Goggins. You could remove this character from the film and essentially nothing would change. His character and the characters that surround him are very insignificant.There is a lot that goes on with Janet Pym played by Michelle Pfieffer and the majority of it is not explained. So although what goes on with Janet is interesting it is ruined by the lack of explanation.Overall this is a good film. With lots of comedy creative action and the development of Hope Ant-Man and the Wasp is a solid film.7.5/10.
1,8,"The most underrated Marvel movie This is a sequel to 2015's Ant-Man that I saw 4 years ago, and I really loved it, and after a rewatch it's the most underrated and overhated Marvel movie, it's quality popcorn flick and is what it tries to be.Michael Pena and Paul Rudd crush it again, and the humor is spot on, Ant-Man and the Wasp is an action packed, hilarious, total breeze of a Marvel movie and it gave way to the best MCU movie to date.Evangeline Lilly shines even more here and does a great job, and pretty much the only complaint I have is the non comic accurate villainI'm gonna give Ant-Man and the Wasp an A-"
2,8,"this is supeeeerrrrr funnnnyy This movie is just funnybut again, it doesn't help that it's slapped between avengers 3.But other than that, i actually thought that the ""villain"" was good and had good intentionspaul rudd does a great job with his character and i thought the wasp was a great addition to the story. Making her be apart of any-man's story instead of her getting her own movie is the right move.I'm intrigued for the trequel especially with Kang being the villain."
3,8,"Love it so much! One of my favourites, hands down. While it does lag in some areas (and the shots underwater were hard to see at times) it's still a fun ride and really enjoyable. The cast is amazing."
4,6,"Daddy Jimmy This movie was simply mediocre. I enjoyed the comedy in it, but some of the rest was boring. Both of the villains were hilariously bad and uninteresting. Ghost was a villain with no personality whatsoever. Sunny Boy villain was so forgettable in every way. I like the fact, that we got the Wasp, but even her character was kind of dull in this. I enjoyed Jimmy Woo. He was a fun addition to the movie. Some of the action was decent, i guess. Overall, this movie is just forgettable and blurry in memory now."
5,8,"8 It's nice to watch a MARVEL movie in which the whole world doesn't hang by a thread for a change. These threats are personal, and yet the writers still feel the need to throw in some heightened countdowns to save Janet, deal with the ghost with the help of Hank's old friend/nemesis Bill (Fishburne). And while the melee series is exhilarating, the complex chases feel familiar, even with all the waning-growing chaos. Luckily, there's plenty more witty banter and inventive directorial touches to keep audiences entertained.Rudd, as always, is surprisingly offhand, moving easily from comedy to emotion and introducing both into action scenes. It's impressive that he never takes anything seriously and yet holds the film together. His interactions with each of the other characters are filled with subtext that allows everyone to shine.It's pretty much exactly what fans will want from an Ant-Man film, and much more than what made the first film such a breakout hit. On the other hand, more adventurous moviegoers will be a little disappointed to see this corner of the Avengers universe settle into such a bookish narrative, with the usual techno nonsense and spectacle just for the sake of it. However, there is a lot of life in this character, and the final scene is a real punch in the gut."
6,9,An incredible story link in the MCU The second Ant-Man film so far is satisfactory. This film is still with the comedy style of Michael Pena as Luis and Paul Rudd as Scott Lang which can still be enjoyed. The inner conflict between son and father is described as very emotional. The visual design in the quantum realm is very good. This film is interesting as a connecting road in the MCU.
7,6,"Perhaps the lightest and most Perhaps the lightest and most airy, as opposed to the third ""Avengers"", Marvel film. The soft-spoken narrative is the best way to make Ant-Man and the Wasp the first movie in the line for your 6-7 year old child who is fond of superheroes. A well-developed antagonist with a simple but believable motivation, lack of responsibility for the fate of the world, excellent actors - all this makes the film an ideal candidate for family viewing. Of the minuses, one can only single out again the stupid order of the post-credits scenes (important - at first, meaningless - after long credits) and the lack of a clear (and generally any) answer to the question, where did Lang and the Wasp cool off during the invasion of Thanos, first in New York and then to Wakanda."
8,6,"The Ant sequel for me The Ant sequel for me turned out to be no better and no worse than the original, but did not become a dull self-copying. All the same light, pleasant and funny. Let the plot and without any surprises, but you definitely won't be bored. The Rudd/Lilly/Douglas trio are also wonderful, very happy with the chemistry. The new actors fit in pretty well. A curious difference from the original is that there is no pronounced antagonist in the usual comic book sense. The quantum world looks bright and interesting. Fresh action with Wasp is very good. By the way, I don't mind if, over time, there will be more strong characters in Marvel, because so far they have turned out just fine. Well, taking into account the fact that we will see Captain Marvel only in March, we can confidently say that Marvel again gave out a great year, all three films were able to meet expectations and give a lot of positive emotions."
9,8,"very interesting film Marvel movies are my favorite. All films are very interesting. If you want to understand everything straight, then you need to watch all the films in turn. While watching the movie, you get used to the main characters very much and you start to worry about them. This movie is suitable for the whole family to watch, and it will be interesting for children and adults."
10,10,"evening light film Sweet, bright, silly, funny, with a great power of kindness and friendship. Well, yes, there are fights and shooting, but they are as naive as possible and made, again, purely for humor. This tape is the perfect choice to take the kids to the movies during their summer break, they're sure to love it and the adults won't be disappointed either. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a superb recreation, and not just from the scope of Infinity War."
11,7,"Its a fun film........... So when ranking the MCU films, this would be in my 10 least favorite. But I do like this film. It is a fun film and if being honest is one of the more easy to watch marvel films. Paul Rudd is very charming and fun as Antman. And I like the action and jokes throughout. But the film when comparing it to other MCU films is..... rather forgettable. But I do like this film. There isn't anything really wrong with it. Its just not one of the MCU'S best films."
12,1,"1 Anaged to be better than expected. 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to me was not as great as critics are saying, but it is also nowhere near as bad as people here have said, while sharing a few of their criticisms. Do like the character of Ant-Man. He is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that."
13,8,"Marvel Cinematic Universe Marathon 2019 #21 Wow! I never thought that Peyton Reed can do the impossible and deliver a smashing Ant-Man film. But in my surprise, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a well written and genuinely funny film that is far more superior than it's previous installment.Paul Rudd impersonating Michelle Pfeiffer and become a diva all of a sudden is one of the best thing this film offered and it is too bad he never kissed Michael Douglas. I was rooting for that moment."
14,7,"A perfectly average MCU installment I love Paul Rudd and Ant Man. This film is good, but it's nothing special. The end credit scene holds the most weight of the whole thing. It's funny with typical MCU wit, it has good action, and a good message about family and love. But on the whole it doesn't really stand out in the lineup of the franchise."
15,8,"5 Such as in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and heart-warming (more so generally than 'Ant-Man')and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene, though more sporadically thankfully than before. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching, the chemistry is more believable here, while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches in a film that generally is appropriately lighter in tone and faster paced."
16,7,"Cassie = MVP Ant Man remains one of the more creative ideas of Marvel. The shrinking and expanding just creates so many peculiar scenes, it's awesome. And oh man, wouldn't it be so convenient having some of these shrinkers and expanders ourselves?Cassie is the MVP for me, her always saving Scott is just too cute.We learned more about the so-called quantum realm which somehow tries to combine quantum physics with hocus pocus. It is quite an intriguing and impenetrable concept and I'm curious as to what they will do with it in Endgame."
17,8,"I'm NOT going to write a synopsis. I like superhero films. Most of them have some levity. My firm belief is that a successful movie must have some comedy relief. This one has more than its share. I won't list them, but there were many subtle references and clever things. Probably the least subtle or clever was the cameo from Stan Lee, which he usually pulls off. But this cameo is just a pointless remark made completely out of context, seemingly only to fulfill the tradition. I used to live in S. F. so it was fun trying to make out which neighborhood they were filming in. All in all, a light-hearted movie with some terrific effects moving a fairly thin plot along nicely."
18,7,"Decent follow up I loved the first one. This one was just lacking something I can't quite put my finger on. The villains were unimpressive, if you can even call them villains. That Ghost character wasn't really even necessary. I'm excited to see more of Ant Man though in future MCU movies."
19,7,"Ant man 2: better than the original but still not great Ant man and the wasp is a improvement over the last movie, but still not great, I do think that the villian is underdeveloped and that there's too many story's going on at once, but it's always entertaining, and of course, the end credit scene is iconic."
20,8,"Enjoyable This was a fun movie which did not take itself that seriously. A really important movie for the MCU as it introduces the quantum realm which links heavily into Endgame. It was much better than the first. The first movie was very kiddish in tone where this, although still aimed at a younger audience, was still a bit more adult and credible. There were some really funny moments in this. Rudd was superb and his trio of friends great. I also really like Douglas. Lilly makes a great wasp but my only criticism really was that it really championed her as being the capable hero and Ant Man's Rudd as being a bit of a loser and buffoon. Not cool. A good watch though. Better than I expected."
21,5,"90% Disney 10% Marvel Maybe you thought that the first one would have shown the futility of repurposing an Avengers hero as a Saturday Morning Comic. You'd be wrong. If you are past puberty the only reason to watch would be on the offchance of seeing.michelle pfeiffer in front of the camera again, if only for a walkon."
22,9,"A mini Marvel movie to bigger Marvel movie The gang has returned to this series.Scott is under house arrest as a result of his actions in Captain America: Civil War. However, trouble arises when fresh opponents approach him. As a result, he seeks assistance from Hope Van Dyne (Henry's daughter), who obtains the Wasp suit. First and foremost, Scott's suit was ""totally"" damaged. But, in Cassie's trophy, his suit was fine towards the middle of the film. That's all right.Ghost (a.k.a. Ava Starr) and Sonny Burch are his adversaries this time. Not until Bill Foster appears as the main enemy. It's strange to put Bill in the role of enemy.Not only that, but Janet Van Dyne makes her first appearance in the MCU. Her comeback (which originally emerged in Scott's body) was fantastic. But I'm looking forward to her next appearance in Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania.The gang's performance was improved this time, but the addition of Laurence Fishburne and Michelle Pheiffer makes the film rather interesting."
23,3,"Atleast they're improving Had some laugh here and there but it is ultimately forgettable. Mostly because of the grounded and uninspired story. You can guess what's going to happen and how they're going to happen the whole time. People shrinking and unshrinking back is what the action scenes are basically, well that and some boring car chase. It is not as generic as the first one, but it's not that good either."
24,6,"A needed sequel that ends up not being destacable at all. Ant-Man and the Wasp is the charming direct sequel to the more charming 2015's Ant-Man. Like its predecessor, the film lays its foundation on a small-scale story so that it can focus on its not-so-small characters, on whom it ends up depending too much, giving birth to a plot with little in particular yet still managing to give you a smile more often than not."
25,4,"Sigh I'm trying to catch-up with the MCU films, but boy...this has been hard.In fact, I even enjoyed enough the first Ant-Man, but this just feels like another generic episode of a long TV show...All the (weak) jokes every 30 seconds, all the jokes in the middle of fights, the predictability, the same formula, always playing safe (this even with bad CGI to ""help"")...I don't know, I just didn't care about anyone or anything. Probably, I can't stand any more MCU films? Maybe it's too much?But I like Shang-Chi, I like Thor: Ragnarok. I'm really confused."
26,9,"I am an Antman fan for sure, but I know how sequels can go... Happily this second installment is even better than the first. Marvel, whatever you do keep the writers for a third eppy, they put in just the right amount of droll humor to keep the story moving. While I enjoyed Antman enough to watch it about six times already, I have watch Antman and the Wasp something like ten times...yes I've been assimilated, heh heh..."
27,8,I was not having very high expectations with this part But the movie is mind blowing This movie is just next level one of the best mcu movies and i would highly recommend you to watch this amazing sci fi movie superb. Go and watch just now goo.
28,7,"A solid sequel Ant-Man and The Wasp is a fun adventure for the characters. The cast has great chemistry, which is assisted by the admirable comedic portions of the film. The visuals are well done, with great editing to help capture the different fight and other intense sequences. A little character development is lacking, but it doesn't take much away from the plot. The overall storyline is exciting and has a nice emotional depth, but does sometimes fall short of being completely eye grabbing. Otherwise, the movie is a worthy addition to the MCU."
29,4,"Nothing new or interesting here... #MCUrewatch. Well, it is inevitable that after a decade of films, originality becomes somewhat of a mission impossible. Ant-Man 2 offers nothing new or interesting we haven't seen before. The villains are by far the weakest of the entire MCU. As a matter of fact: this film seems to solely exist to explain the quantum theory (which will make time traveling possible for Avengers End Game). And in that case a 120 minutes film is just too long."
30,3,"Bad movie We can't say that this movie is a great sequel to a not-so-spectacular first part. It insists on presenting an unusual divorced couple where the former couple love each other and the daughter has no conflict with the matter. Paul Rudd offers a hollow character, unsympathetic and who repeats the same gags over and over again. All the supporting characters lack brightness with the exception of Michael Peña who luckily has a couple of jokes and Randall Park who steals the movie with his character. Michael Douglas puts a little style and the rest almost nothing. A movie without villains is a waste of time. There is no drama, there is no moral, the jokes are repeated, there is hardly any freshness and the final half hour is appalling as there is too much cgi without substance or content."
31,8,"Very creative and fun The movie is a lot of entertaiment and it surprised me how most of the screentime is action scenes (Not violent lol) with very funny ideas like the ""hotwheels"" and laughable comedy, not as other generic marvel jokes, the villain is confusing but it has a tragic story after all, it has his flaws like the physics are nonsense and sometimes the vfx is weak but still a really entertainment film, if you haven´t seen go watch it."
32,9,The most underrated Marvel franchise With time off I've gone back over the whole back catalogue of Marvel and it dawned on me how underrated the Antman franchise really is Maybe it's the closeness of when the two film were realised in terms of the following juggernauts of the Avenger movies but Paul Rudd really is a perfect Antman plus the supporting cast really do back the movie up with fantastic pacing I hope the next in the series keeps up the great work.
33,9,Great movie! Ant-Man has literally become one of the most important characters of the whole MCU!
34,8,"Fun, humorous and entertaining Ant-Man helps Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne search for Janet who is lost in the quantum realm.This is an enjoyable movie that works better in the overall narrative of the Marvel Cinematic Universe than it does as a stand-alone feature.The search for Janet is a good, simple idea for the main plot, but it is slightly cluttered by some character moments, such as the backstory of the main antagonist and the reappearance of other side villains. The connection between Scott Lang and Janet is also somewhat dubious. However, the significance of developing the concept of the quantum realm is important in the bigger picture of the MCU 'infinity stones' era and this is where strength of its storytelling lies.Personally I do not take the issue with minor story problems in a movie played so much for laughs. Humour is a big part of 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' and the verbal and sight gags all work for me. Actors like Paul Rudd, Michael Peña and Randall Park are gifted comedic performers and I enjoy listening to their banter here. The dialogue is well written and performed by all.Visually it is similar to the original 'Ant-Man' with hugely fun and thrilling effects-driven sequences. It mixes the large and small worlds perfectly to create great spectacle.The more straight actors such as Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Lawrence Fishburne, Michelle Pfeiffer and Hannah John-Kamen are on good form. Abby Ryder-Fortson is great once more as Cassie.I think it has one of the best mid-credit sequences of any MCU movies and it is essential to watch this prior to seeing 'Avenger: Endgame'.Overall I prefer it to the original as there is less of the obvious exposition dialogue and importantly it held my 5 year old daughter for the full duration."
35,7,"Fun The first movie was better, but I watched this movie in the cinema and it was very enjoyable."
36,1,"Ant-Man and the Wasp The worst Marvel movie, the movie ruined all the good things from the first part, the first part was not a good movie, but it was much better than the second part, I don't recommend watching it."
37,7,"You want a juice box and some string cheese? I liked this movie a lot. When it came out after Infinity War, it was regarded as a ""lesser"" Marvel effort. Something mindless to waste time on until the next real installment. I was totally fine with this movie. The villains were mostly weak, except Walter Goggins, who turns in a performance that I enjoyed almost as much as Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. Well worth a watch, and for me, worth multiple viewings."
38,8,"nice one Ant-Man and the Wasp is an awe-inspiring film. Director Peyton Reed has maintained all the quirks, gags, one-liners & unique action, that made Ant-Man(2015) such a thoroughly enjoyable movie."
39,5,"Had nothing to it It's an ok movie just had nothing to it, the villain was a nobody. The whole movie is just Paul Rudd running around San Francisco. BORING!!"
40,6,"#Movie Review Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) is a mediocre sequel to Ant-Man (2015). First, I have to point out that I expect every upcoming movie to be better than its predecessor. Unfortunately, this is not the case.Marvel is a slow learner when it comes to villains. This movie suffers from the same issue as Ant-Man (2015). Its villain is uncompelling and uninteresting. You get the sense that you've watched a filler important to Avengers Endgame rather than an impactful stand-alone movie."
41,6,"Flimsy but why not Decent and entertaining summer movie that felt kind of flat. It still has its fun and imaginative moments, but definitely lacks the personality and freshness of the first movie. I guess this has to do with Peyton Reed being alone this time (Edgar Wright was initially in charge of ""Ant-man""). The main plot is actually more interesting this time, even though it's nothing that we haven't already seen somewhere else. That's really all I have to say about it."
42,9,"I would love to see many such films. Throughout Entertaining Ant-Man and the Wasp is an action, Sci-fi, comedy film directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Peña, Walton Goggins, Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, Tip T. I. Harris, David Dastmalchian, Hannah John-Kamen, Abby Ryder Forston, Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne with Michael Douglas.The best part of any film is it's script and it's execution and for a film to be successful both should go hand in hand and in this film is pretty much example of how a good movie is to be made.The plot of the film is simple but the execution is superb and will keep you engaged throughout, the film is a perfect example of an action comedy film and the best part is that all the characters have got chance to showcase their talent and non-one has wasted the opportunity.Acting in the film is superb and Paul Rudd had once again proven that no one could've done the character of ant-man with such a perfection. He always shines whenever he is on screen. Michael Peña, Tip T. I. Harris and Dastmalchian provided the comical relief and made a great trio. Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne are known talent and were equally effective. Evangeline Lilly was good and Hannah John-Kamen was also surprisingly good. Abby Ryder Forston deserves a special mention as she was very cute and we would love to see her more in future..Screenplay of the film is good and will keep you engaged throughout. Also the humour and funny scenes in between will keep tickling your funny bones. The climax of the movie is predictable but entertaining.Overall I am very much satisfied and entertained after watching this movie and I am very much looking forward for many more sequels. A must watch super hero film."
43,8,Great Great movie it's higher then ant man villian was forgettable but still a pretty decent movie with lots of jokes and fun I think this movie is kinda underrated this movie overall is great loved the scene that he gets big.
44,7,"Fun with no consequences This review contains spoilers.Ant-Man and the Wasp is the sequel to 2015's Ant-Man. The movie starts Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Pena in their respective roles from the first movie. Scott Lang's ability to return from the quantum realm makes Hank Pym and Hope Pym believe that they can retrieve Janet Van Dyne from the quantum realm she was trapped in following events in the past. Scott Lang is placed under house arrest following the aid he gave to Captain America during Captain America: Civil War and must navigate around the law.Ant-Man and the Wasp is an entertaining movie. The charm and the fun from the first movie is here. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly have good chemistry on the screen. The two are able to play off of the funny dialogue they are given. Likewise Michael Pena is hilarious as Luis. His fast-talking explanations and quick cut montages are fun to watch. Likewise there are many situations that are fun to watch like Scott Lang's Ant-Man suit malfunctioning causing him to be child-sized in an elementary school.There is not a lot of action in this movie an the movie does well from this as it can focus on its great leads. Even the side characters like Bill Foster played by Laurence Fishburne are a joy to watch. The effects in this movie have been well-done. This movie looks better than the other stand-alone Marvel movies. The shrinking effects look good. The quantum realm and tardigrades look trippy. The phasing of Ghost looks amazing as it always seems she is in several frames at once.The problem with the movie is its lack of consequences. From the beginning of the movie to the end of its run-time, noting of true consequence happens. Janet Van Dyne is retrieved from the quantum realm and that is it. Every conflict in between is manufactured to make the movie engaging rather than to have it develop organically. For example, the conflict with Ava Starr/Ghost is pointless because Janet Van Dyne is able to help her after she escapes the quantum realm. There was no reason for Ghost to be opposed to the Pym plans from the start as it was always going to be the case that they would help Ghost after they retrieved Janet. The only event of consequence in the movie happens at the end with Ant-Man being trapped in the quantum realm after Janet, Hank, and Hope fade to dust from Thanos' snap in Avengers: Infinity War.Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun movie to watch. It is recommended to all audiences. However to those expecting a movie with significant plot developments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, these audiences should look elsewhere.Grade: B."
45,1,meh I mean if you love The Suicide Squad (2021) and think it's the best movie of 2021 then you'll love this. Skip this otherwise.
46,9,"Funny And Fun To Watch One of my favorite MCU films so far, this film combines comedy and whimsy to create a very fun experience.Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), after the events of the last Ant-Man film, considers the possibility of rescuing his wife from the Quantum Realm. He and daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) worked in the two years Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been under house arrest to produce the necessary technology. When they attempt to buy the last item needed, they come up against three new adversaries, including a mysterious ghost-like figure played by Hannah John-Kamen.Pym's technology that allows things to shrink or grow is fertile ground for whimsical scenes and wonderment. The writers take full advantage of it in this episode.As in the last episode, Rudd gets to voice many of the comedic lines. But the writers added several other characters who are quirky or inept, allowing for even more humor. One of the funniest scenes involves a reputed ""truth serum"" being administered to Lang's sidekick, Luis (Michael Pena).Like the last Ant-Man film, this one adds little to the overall Marvel story line, but it is quite enjoyable."
47,7,"Heart-warming & great action scenes & funny also I say this is a 7 star because this movie was very cool and funny. My favorite character in this movie in the Ghost aka the bad guy/girl(you people might disagree with me!). It is so cool how the people who worked for this movie did the effects for Ghost/Ava to move and the fazes like in the movie. SO COOL! But also there are other things that I like in this movie. I like the scene where Scott and his daughter, Cassie, played in their house in the beginning of the movie. I like many other scenes too! Also, like how they did the effects to become small or big. I like the scene where Hope and Scott were in the small car where the pigeons are looking at them, it reminds me of a Jurassic Park scene, when Lex and Tim were in the car and trying to turn off the light for the T-Rex not to attack them. Michael Pena is very funny in this movie and he is my second favorite character in this movie. Stan Lee was also in this movie too! Before he died in November of 2018. He was the creator of Marvel. He is an amazing person. This movie is a great action and comedy movie!"
48,1,worse than the 1st! I didn't think anything could be worse than the first Ant Man but they topped it with this one! Only a couple actual funny parts... barely any action at all.. horrible bad guy what a mess! Don't waste your time.
49,10,"AWESOME movie! I finally got around to seeing this movie with my brother last night and it was a complete BLAST! Funny, action packed and just a great all around movie! Now some people...TheBigSick didn't care for it. Read his review and I thought it was a bit harsh. Sorry it not up to your dreary standards or Oscar worthy, but most of America liked it as it cost 162,000,000 to make...made almost half of that on it's opening weekend with 75,812,205 and then the gross of Canada and America coming in at a whopping 216,648,740 and THEN the worldwide mind blowing 622,674,139. Yeah, TheBigSick...this was SUCH a bad movie. I loved the plot, get Hopes mother back after she shrank so small she went into the quantum realm, how the story continued for Scott after the whole Civil War movie...and how Scott was put into the quantum to begin with, seeing that in endgame he was freed by that rat at the beginning of that movie. It tied up a bunch of loose ends for me. Watch this movie! You won't regret it! Peace!"
50,7,"Refreshing Ant-Man and the Wasp was lighthearted and fun. Coming off the snap at the end of Infinity War, this film was refreshing. It goes back to the tried and true MCU formula of mixing humor (truth serum) with fun action sequences (the car chase). My main complaint about Ant-Man and the Wasp is the excess of ""bad guys"" chasing after Scott and a lack of real tension. Still, the film was a solid entry and Paul Rudd shined. His genuine nature and likability elevate this film higher than it would have been without him."
51,6,"Downgrade from the first, which wasn't much better. Such a shame, as Paul Rudd is a fantastic protagonist. In fact, this movie, along with the previous, arguably has the most likable group of actors out of all the MCU movies. However, unlike the first, the pacing in this one was pretty terrible. Overall, the screenplay is pretty poorly written outside of clever jokes here and there. A few of the plot points were either inevitable or completely unnecessary. I was shocked to learn that a third movie is on its way. I'm hopeful that they can learn what works and what doesn't from these first two films. Mostly, I hope that they love on from this main plot that the two movies overall focus on."
52,8,"Ant-Man and the Wasp By no means is this one of the best Marvel movies, but just like the first one, it is a more kid friendly, light hearted action-comedy, and I love that. This movie had to follow Avengers: Infinity War, so naturally it was going to be a step down, but this movie did what it needed to do to set up Avengers: Endgame with Ant-Man being in it. I have already seen all the Marvel movies, I am just rewatching all of them before Black Widow, and after watching this one again, I can see that it is very important. It gave us a deeper understanding of the quantum realm, and something that I won't spoil happened that sets up Endgame. This movie was also a good movie in general. I thought the plot and story were pretty cool, and we got the usual laughs we get from this crew. We also got to see some more of something I liked in the first movie, it was Scott's relationship with his daughter. It is something we have only seen with Scott in the MCU so far, and we got to explore more of that in this movie, something I wanted after the first movie.Personally, I think this movie was better than the original, this one had good laughs, light hearted ness, it was kid friendly, and it even had some good action. Just like the first movie, I recommend this for a family movie night.*Warning* If this is your family movie night pick, don't watch the first Credit Scene, littler kids may not like it."
53,10,Antmann This is SUCH a funny film annnnnd cant wait for Antman 3!
54,3,"One of the MCU's weaker efforts Overrated, and I've enjoyed most of the recent MCU films. This one, however, was too uneven in pacing, too unimaginative in filmmaking, and too flat in humor besides admittedly a few amusing moments. Edgar Wright would've injected so much more life, timing, cinematic craft and clever writing in these Ant-Man flicks."
55,4,Ant-Man and the Wasp was a boring movie The story of this movie was very boring. It's very forgettable. One thing I like about the movie is the once again perfect cast and performance.
56,1,"Insipid, vile. Ugh such a pain I couldn't even watch the whole thing; I was leaving the room and coming back like a Jack-in-the-Box. Ughhhhhh... It's like a comedy that can't commit to being funny, a drama that can't commit to being dramatic, an action movie that can't commit to action scenes, a video game that can't commit to being played. It's everything but also nothing. A homogenous glop, the same spit-up that the Disney/Marvel/Star Wars assembly line has been force-feeding its customers.Thank goodness there are other movies to watch."
57,9,"Lighthearted, fun to watch I watched this movie as a part of my marathon to see all the MCU movies after Infinity War came up. Technically Infinity War was as far as I was going to have my marathon, but by the time I reached that point, this movie had also come out. So I saw this also. It felt a bit out of place considering there were two very heavy movies one after another (Black Panther and Infinity War), because of which it looked like a balloon compared to those anvils. But at the same time it was at least better than Captain Marvel so it gets some browny points from my side.Ant-Man and the Wasp is a very hilarious movie to say the least. I just love how the Ant-Man series always shows things to look very dramatic when they are tiny but they are actually very miniscule events when it happens in the real size. There are many emotional scenes too, as the premise of this movie is entirely about Scott trying to find the Janet, Hank's wife whom he presumed dead after all these years since they last went on a mission together. The very beginning of the movie itself begins from an emotional scene with little Hope saying her final goodbye to her mother. She is occasionally contacted by a ghost as a part of her dreams, which later turns out to be her mother.Meanwhile Scott has been put under house arrest for being on Captain America's side in Civil War. So he has to manage looking like he's at home while he's out there saving the day. I really liked how the bad guys literally steal Hank's office by just shrinking it, picking it up and walking away. The bad guys are also comical, especially the Indian one who says ""This is not truth serum! There is no such thing as a truth serum!"". The comedy scenes in the movie completely outshine the sad scenes, which I can say with a guarantee since I watched this movie 2 years ago and I only remember the good parts of it.There are of course a couple of things I didn't really like in this movie. First of all, the regular MCU problem - a dozen jump cuts in every fight scene. Why do they have to do this? All the fight scenes would havelooked not just cool, but even iconic if they didn't do that. Secondly even the dire moments get overshadowed by the funny moments when they don't have to be. Like when Hope finally meets Janet there is a joke immediately after. I get the movie is trying to keep the ""Ant-Man"" touch to it constantly, but this is going too far. And lastly, the post credit scene was so awesome, but it got ruined in Endgame. I know it's not this movie's fault but rather Endgame's fault for doing that, but these movies were planned together so if they knew this would have such an anticlimactic end they shouldn't have done it.I can absolutely guarantee you that Ant-Man and the Wasp will only leave you with good memories. There is no absolutely bad thing that happens in it, and it manages to retain the humour, cinematography and sotryline that one would expect from a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie."
58,6,This movie This movie made no sense with its plot. The movie try's to have like able characters but it dose not hit.
59,8,"What Was Needed After Infinity War This was the perfect movie to be released following Thanos defeating the Avengers. And that's not me saying this movie is perfect, as it is far from perfect, I'm just saying this movie was very fun, light, and warm-hearted, which was what we needed after Thanos winning. Also, unlike most people I think this movie is on-par with the first one, and I think the cast and story are just as good. Overall, this is a very fun and light-hearted movie.7.6/10."
60,3,Why to give up Pretty good but then end just gave up in a sea of liberal wimpyness and sad loserness. Of course it's al the cops fault and the criminals are just misunderstood.
61,7,"""Do You Guys Just Put The Word 'Quantum' In Front Of Everything?"" This film picks up two years after Captain America: Civil War, and follows Scott Lang under house arrest for his role in the events of that movie. Scott is forced to help Hank Pym and his daughter Hope find a way to re-enter the Quantum Realm in order to rescue Hope's mother Janet. Along the way, they are confronted by the Ghost, a villain who can walk through walls and catch her opponents by surprise. All of the main cast members from the first Ant-Man return, and are joined by Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, Randall Park, and Hannah John-Kamen.Ant-Man and the Wasp follows Scott trying to stay out of trouble and finish up his punishment for ""breaking"" the law.This movie gives Evangeline Lilly a bigger role, as she gets to participate in the action scenes alongside Paul Rudd as the Wasp. Her suit is uniquely designed, and unlike the Ant-Man suit, Wasp is outfitted with a variety of gadgets like wings and blasters. And her relationship with Hank has much improved since the last film.This film has plenty of humour alongside the action. More than in the last one, the comedy is where this movie really shines. Again, Paul Rudd is a delightful presence, and he's given several good moments, like being toddler-sized for a little bit and his house arrest montage at the beginning.Again, the supporting cast is delightful to see. Michael Pena's Luis remains a standout; pretty much everything he says gets a chuckle out of you, and we see more storytelling from him Michelle Pfeiffer isn't in the film for very long, but she manages to do well despite her limited screentime. Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost is an interesting character to watch, and her relationship with Laurence FIshburne's Bill Foster is like a father-daughter relationship, even if they aren't actually related.So Michael Pena stole the show last time, but that honor goes to a different person this time around. Randall Park he's just an all-around fun character to watch. His love-hate dynamic with Scott is done well.While the Quantum Realm was barely glimpsed in the last movie, it gets an expanded presence in this film. We learn a bit more about what it actually is, and how it affects the people who are trapped inside it. And we actually get to see more ""locations"" in the Realm, with plenty of crazy creatures, colorful environments, and straight-up awesome visual effects.So if you've seen Avengers: Infinity War, then you know that Ant-Man wasn't even in that film. We not only get to see why that was, but we also see how the ending of that film impacts this one. And if the post-credits scenes are any indication, it's an unnerving sight. The Quantum Realm is a central focus of this movie, and it ends with Scott being trapped there with no way out. Rudd is confirmed to appear in Avengers 4, but it's not clear exactly what role that will be. I've heard rumors about time-travel and using the Quantum Realm as a solution to Infinity War's ending, but I generally don't put too much stock into rumors; I prefer to see what actually happens, and more often than not rumors don't actually go anywhere.Anyway, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun, well-paced, action-packed palette cleanser for the darkness of Infinity War, and I look forward to seeing where they take the characters next."
62,8,"A 60-year old woman flirts with her husband vicariously through an electrical engineer Okay, so the sequel relies slightly too heavily on the previous installment rather than utilise the rest of the Marvel franchise, but that's not a deadly sin. Pretending to be a whale is. Especially given how excited that tour guide was about it. She must've been heartbroken after this. And I think we can all agree that Hot Wheels look so much better life-sized. With a sparkly clean undercarriage, of course."
63,5,"meh... It´s really not as good as the first one, I blame the director because we've already seen this cast and argument work well in other ocations.It's still a pretty decent superhero movie one of Marvel´s worst but it´s fine not a complete disaster. 5 stars out of 10."
64,8,"Ants to Ashes... Ant-Man returns in the spirit of the best juvenile Science Fiction! There's some swearing and ultra violence mostly in the beginning to establish characters and the stakes involved, but most of the plot revolves around some very witty shrinking and enlargements of people, objects and environments and disappearing acts done with the usual Marvel panache. Paul Rudd reprises his role as Scott Lang AKA Ant-Man. He is now under house arrest for having violated the Sokovia Accords, and with only days left to serve he comes to learn that Doctor Hank Pym and his daughter Hope Van Dyne need his help after establishing a more stable tunnel into the Quantum realm. Their mission is to go back into the Quantum Realm to rescue Pym's wife Janet Van Dyne as played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who has been trapped inside lo these many years. Lang reluctantly agrees to assist them after setting up a decoy in his place and giving the ever vigilant authorities the slip.What works best in this latest MCU entry are the human touches. There is more development of the father and daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie as once again played by Abby Ryder Fortsen and the introduction of a new character, Maggie, Lang's ex-wife, as played by Judy Greer. This sets up some interesting inter-generational dynamics as Lang's relationships with his loved ones tend to mirror or reflect off of his mentor Pym's relationship with his daughter as played by Evangeline Lily and his wife estranged from him in the Quantum Realm. It is sort of like The Silver Age Ant-Man working with the MCU Ant-Man to get him up to speed in the 21st Century. There is also some colorful backstory added when Pym goes to a former disgruntled colleague Doctor Bill Foster, as played by Laurence Fishburne, for a hand. It quickly becomes apparent that director Peyton Reed has a Steve Jobs/Bill Gates rivalry going on here and that Fishburne as Doctor Foster is hiding some secrets of his own.Henna John-Kamen makes a startling arch nemesis first to The Wasp and then to Ant-Man as Ava Starr AKA Ghost, desperate for a little Quantum Energy healing for a terminal condition that worsens by the hour and the day. Michael Pena as Luis riffs and improvises like never before under the influence of truth serum and it makes for some of the most hilarious moments in the piece. He nearly becomes an open book to a Black Marketeer named Sonny Burch played with zany menace by Walton Goggins, who has designs on Pym's technology. 'T. I.' and Kurt as members of the X-Con Security Team crew are also back to rescue Pym's goods from falling into the wrong hands. There are escape and chases scenes here worthy of a high-tech Buster Keaton and the Keystone Cops.The warp speed pace keeps the visual gags fresh and poppin' and while the objectives of this tale are treated deadly serious, the solutions posited by the scientists on the run get more and more outlandish and incredible. Thanks to some nimble evasive action from Lang and his daughter, Pym is once again able to enter the Quantum Realm to rescue his wife. While Lang is involved in a strenuous game of hide-and-seek with his parole officer Randall Park as Jimmy Woo, Ava Starr struggles to find a way to feed off the energy from the Quantum Realm to ease and cure her pain. Laurence Fishburne seeks to prevent her from going the 'by any means necessary' route and needlessly putting in jeopardy the lives of others. Meanwhile Janet Van Dyne's escape from the Quantum Realm becomes more and more perilous, even with life risking help from her husband and his new friends.The CGI and special effects seem to blend seamlessly into the story, but it would be ridiculous to suggest that they don't stand out as a special feature all their own. The irreverent spirit of the Marvel narrative is well served by the musical score of Christopher Beck, and the cliffhanging tactics of the serial adventure here seem aided and abetted by principles from Buckminister Fuller regarding structure and systems. The cinematography of Dante Spinotti pulses with breathtaking thrills spiced with humorous asides, both musically as well as visually provided by the characters themselves. The commendable costume designs of Louise Frogley, and especially her work with Ivo Coveney on the superhero suits, keep us thoroughly rooted in this world of quick changes in all directions for this colorful cast of characters. When all is said and done, and Scott Lang returns to end his house arrest, we find ourselves still witness to one more death-defying experiment that brings us to a hazy conclusion filled with even more questions than answers."
65,8,my opinion The action that happened in the end was beautiful .. and also the ending scene was a shock when it was linked to the Avengers movie: Infinity War.
66,7,Estimated Cooking Time 2h 5mins Put Michelle Pfeiffer back in she's not done yet...
67,10,"Fun and Underrated This film gets some flak for lacking stakes and emotional conflicts. But come on, it's a fun film, and it's not turn-off-your-brain brain, it's the smart kind of fun."
68,4,"Quite Bad One of those Superhero movies you just wish you didn't waste your time on. Bad story line, mindless and boring."
69,9,"It was just as good as the other MCU movies. It was a really good movie, I loved it. I loved the new characters and just the whole storyline. I also really liked that this wasn't nearly as traumatizing as Infinity War. Honestly it was just a great movie, just what I expected from the MCU."
70,8,"Good! Not better than the first movie, but still have all the factors that make it a good one, the comedy and action scenes are amazing, and also the story is good, just is not at the same level as the first one."
71,7,"This is a winner! It pulls off something pretty cool, a big MCU style film that still feels intimate.Paul Rudd uses his charm and goofy smile to endear the audience to him and the film. Its funny with good action, standard MCU, but that's a good standard.Good fun film!"
72,7,"It's okay It was wasn't my favourite movie, but it was fine. I Mean it got me watch the full movie,but Ant-Man 1 was better."
73,6,"Watched multiple times, still the weakest character villain of the MCU So the original cast is great, but Ghost is lame, stupidly changed for the pathetic reasoning and then played by Hannah John-Kamen who is not be good in anything previous or this. However it's still better than certain MCU movies thanks to the rest of the cast. Main flaw after Ghost was Laurence Fishburne, he really should have been given a much bigger role in the MCU - Bill Foster was decent and the voice of the Silver Surfer is cool, but c'mon."
74,10,"exactly what I wanted to see: unreal stuff in real world I am amazed. Just so much so extreme things. Best is the graphics and topic. So interesting to see so many things and being changing shape, is already by itself deserving 10 star rating. Everything looks so real, both small and large stuff. So many jokes, characters, devices, abilities. Nice presence of that new character from CSI, then of FBI and police, then that foe I know as being foe in other movies too. Good topic which is quantum physics, and I find it to be religious also because it deals with life and death, space and time, existence. So good feeling just of possibility of turning some toy into real stuff. This is so interesting and can motivate many scientist to turn it into reality. Hot girl and all characters are good in some way, some funny, some emotional, some confident. Bit unrealistic and extreme story, but that does not in any way cause me to be amazed by the graphics. Mix of emotions, with mostly feeling of excitement, but then feeling of worry or fear at the end. Also many unpredictable things and common things. Similar to Spiderman, just more extreme and deep."
75,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018, Peyton Reed) Wasp finally gets headline billing in a solid follow up to the original with important connective tissue to the large MCU as a whole Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018, Peyton Reed) After the colossal events that were 'Black Panther' and 'Infinity War' the entire world can breathe a collective sigh of relief as Marvel returns to more modest, yet no less compelling fare, in the follow up to 2015's 'Ant-Man' and I think in many ways this film actually surpasses that one while keeping the same understated superhero vibe. This is a very self contained movie until the very end featuring no character outside of the Ant-Man storyline. The movie starts as Scott Lang is under house arrest, apparently the only Avenger to have real world repercussions due to the events of 'Civil War'. His aiding of Captain America made not only him a fugitive but the Van Dyne's as well who now apparently hate him, but of course that cannot hold and the action picks up when Scott gets a vision of/from the original Wasp, Janet Van Dyne, possibly still alive. This spurs the plot along as the Van Dynes and Scott attempt to pinpoint and save her while at the same time dodging various bad guys. The villains are a weak point here. Walton Goggins shows up as some black market mover and shaker but doesn't ever present himself as a villain really worth taking seriously. The other primary enemy is a mysterious shrouded figure who has some legit fighting skills and can phase. She is known as Ghost, but transitions into more of a sympathetic character as her story is revealed. Randall Park shows up as a gung-ho FBI agent, and while applaud his appearance I think he falls into the realm of caricature and is played too much for laughs as he is obsessively attempting to bring down Scott Lang like an odd Wile-E-Coyote to Lang's Roadrunner. Rudd's cohorts from the first film, who are led by Michael Pena, are now all running a private security business. As a counterpoint to Park they are the same humorous characters but they feel a little more genuine and lived in this time around. Just like the first film I love the sad sack humor that Rudd brings to Lang and it forms a nice counterpoint to Evangeline Lilly's Wasp who is smart, capable and an all around bad ass. It is nice to see her ditch the severe hairstyle of the last film for a much more natural, endearing look here. Her elevation to title character and all the scenes that go with it are about the best thing in the movie. The search for the original Wasp is worthy storyline here and this film amounts to a fun action comedy skewing away from the darker road Marvel has recently been trodding down. This film doesn't carry that weight but its lightness feels like a breath of fresh air in the MCU. And the post credit scene is easy predict a mile away, but it brings their little insular story right back home into the larger framework that is the MCU. Eric's Grade: B"
76,4,"Not nearly as good as the first one... When the first Ant Man movie was about to be released I did not have much excitement for it at all but then it REALLY surprised me and it's actually a very good movie. I'd give the original a 7.5/10.So, liking the original one so much, I actually couldn't wait for Ant Man and the Wasp to come out. However, it had the opposite effect on me this time and I was rather disappointed with it. The entire plot seemed like it was just an after thought. They just needed to come up with some reason to have Scott Lang be stuck in the quantum zone by the end of the movie so the ""Avengers: Endgame"" script would work. Another reason I believe that the plot was nothing but an after thought is that for a majority of the movie, all the characters do is run around with Hank Pym's shrunken lab with all the characters trying to get it for themselves and keep it out of the hands of the bad guys; Ghost and Walter Goggins. By the end of the movie, it totally felt as if nothing had happened at all. It's clearly not a good sign when the best and most talked about scene of your movie is the mid-credits scene where Hope, Hank and Janet all get dusted from Thanos' snap and the effect is that Scott gets trapped in the quantum zone because there's nobody out there to work the controls for him.I mean, overall, the movie did both things that it needed to do which was 1) provide the audience with a cute little story with very little to no consequence; especially after the previous movie being ""Avengers: Infinity War"" I believe Marvel thought their audience could use a little break from all the loss and destruction from that movie; and 2) have Scott Lang be stuck inside the quantum zone when the movie finishes.I really like almost every MCU movie they've put out but this is one of the exceptions. It just felt like this movie had no soul.Sorry, but I'd give this movie a rating of 4/10. I hope your 3rd outing is MUCH MUCH better then the sequel... one can only hope right?"
77,6,Ok It's not good but it's not bad either TBH Ok movie
78,5,"Worst Marvel franchise, still funny This series obviously wasn't given the best writers/directors....... its not very engaging and up to Marvel standards, but of course Paul Rudd is amazing and its very funny at times. Me: I dont really like this Movie: *features part of San Francisco where I work* Me: I LIKE THIS"
79,7,"Family movie Well put together family movie with loads of special effects and a lot of fun. But it's a little too strong. All the same, a charming side with the little girl and the flirting with the wasp."
80,7,"A fine watch, but A fine watch, but the novelty and freshness that the first film had has dissipated.I enjoyed 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' just about enough. It's the MCU's weakest film, up until this point at least, so far. I rate the 2015 film quite a bit, it's entertaining and something different, but this sequel kinda felt flat to me for the majority. There's marginally enough there to like though.Paul Rudd is satisfactory as the lead, while Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña remain as solid as before. Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne are cool additions, but I can't say their characters are all that memorable - still passable, mind you.The action is the film's biggest plus. The shrinking stuff always looks good, too. The humour is at a suitable level. Overall, it's an OK watch."
81,10,"Ant Man and the Wasp is as good as heaven When I die I will watch this movie on loop. The acting is great, the casting's incredible, ghost isn't a great supervillain and is kindof confusing but the movie is great fun and very rewatchable."
82,7,A different view I avoided the antman movies for a while because I'm new into comics and I thought a superhero called antman? Must be a joke. But it wasn't and I was pleasantly surprised to see T.I. in these movies. Paul Rudd is a fun accidental superhero. And they incorporated his partner seamlessly I think. It's not the typical high stakes MCU comic book drama which is a nice break from all the dark tension. Easy watch.
83,7,B- (high 6). June 18' @AMC Very grounded for a comic-book film which works for the story. Plot is a bit sloppy and unfocused. Character arcs don't quite hit especially emotional scenes. Solid direction and works well. Formulaic but fun and relatively clever. Strong and enthusiastic performances.
84,6,"It's just fine I don't have much to say about this movie, it's just alright. The characters are alright, the plot is fine, and the pacing is solid. I also like the action scenes, even though they aren't as good as the first. The villain is solid, with understandable and relatable motivations, and the side characters are mostly memorable as well. The movie doesn't really have anything more to offer though, and despite all the things it does right, nothing really impressed me. This might be because I watched it right after Infinity War, one of the best MCU movies, and thus the drop in quality felt even bigger than it could've otherwise. Overall, it's a simple, entertaining movie with high production value and a fun atmosphere, and not much depth."
85,6,"Confusing In all fairness, i could have focused more but it was quite confusing. I didn't really understand what was going on but nether the less it was a good film."
86,7,"Good for entertainment This movie is just okay to watch. This movie has one of the worst villain of all time. I mean does it even have a villian❓🤣🤣, very stupid plot throughout, but very very entertaining to watch."
87,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) Review - 7.6/10 Unlike most people I enjoy this movie over the first one and I think it benefitted coming out after Avengers: Infinity War. I say this because after such a dark ending in Infinity War, a light-hearted movie was exactly what we needed. And I think this movie is just like the first, with everything dialed up to ten. In short, this film was funny and enjoyable enough. If I do have a complaint, it's that this movie had a very under-developed and uninteresting villain."
88,8,"Light and enjoyable A touching story, well developed on its own terms and a fun ride full of eye-candy actions. I, too, think that Ghost should have been explored deeper and more strongly with more shiny scenes featuring her.Very nice VFX and the work of many professionals. Bravo. A nice addition to Marvel Ant-Man and deserving a sequel most definitely.Evangeline Lilly is nice as The Wasp, with shiny black sleek hairs and a much shorter haircut."
89,10,"Fun Comic-Hero Movie for all the Family This movie was a blast... Great action scenes aplenty. Very clever too, the way the Ant-Man and Wasp suits and those cool shrinking Hot Wheel cars are used!A great movie for families, as a big part of the plot/story involves both Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and Hank Pym's family members.Also, the trip into the tiny sub-atomic micro-verse is very cool. This part is something debated by science.As a fan of comics and science, this adventure was a great mix of both!"
90,5,it's just not necessary The movie is good but not necessary It does not add anything new to Marvel universe and the storytelling and story line is boring and slow.
91,5,"The best way to show a character like ant man, wasp had a nice debute. The movie is awesome in all ways, the CGI, the acting, the story and the small twist, all made the movie enjoyable, can't believe that marvel doesn't knows how to make a movie on character like Spiderman but knows exactly how to hit a character like ant man. The movie is a must watch and is truly one of its kind, I liked how marvel contained it's cringy comedy as the thing about which I was worried the most was that marvel will spoil serious moments with it's cringy comedy, that indirectly indicates that the director has no confidence in the scene but in this movie it seems that marvel is now containing that kind of cringy comedy and is focusing more on how to develop a character in a way that we like to see. Overall I can say that the movie is must watch and the only flaw that it has is that, it's story is too basic and the direction has nothing new when compared to the previous MCU movies and also the cringy comedy which although didn't messed up serious moments but still was pretty cringy."
92,7,"Enjoyable, frivolous entertainment Paul Rudd is likeable as the main character. It's cool how they incorporated some of his apparent real-life skills and interests into the movie - namely card magic and drumming (also hobbies I've been into). Rudd is funny and I found his dumbfounded looks amusing when smarter characters talked scientific mumbo jumbo. He's not portrayed as stupid, but just not sure what on Earth they're talking about.Rudd's connection with his daughter in the movie is very cute and endearing - it seems very natural and real. It makes us like him more considering the fact that he has a criminal history. The side characters are amusing with their quirky accents, stupid arguments they have and long, irrelevant stories they launch into. The main police guy is funny as well, taking interest in Rudd's amateur magic skills and seeming ability to be in more than one place at a time.There are some cool and creative action parts, although they're nothing amazing or truly new. Still, they make the movie entertaining and not feel too formulaic. The villain is interesting at first but later ends up coming across as a tired old cliche with a typical backstory and motivation which don't really hold up that well. But I guess villains often struggle to direct their anger at the right people which is why they're villains - if they thought logically, they'd become good guys.A subplot with Michael Douglas is not as interesting and the science is certainly very hokey. You have to suspend all disbelief but the tone of the movie makes that fairly easy. It's just a shame they couldn't consult some physicists to explore some more believable or realistic ideas. Lawrence Fishburn is wasted in a small role which changes little.The Ant-Man and the Wasp works mainly as a light-hearted comedy with some decent action and silly sci-fi/thriller plot ideas thrown in."
93,6,"Predictable In general is a good movie with funny things and original things but is predictable and pretty dull. Oh, there are some songs that are pretty annoying."
94,3,"The second doesn't save the first one Sorry to watch that the second is worst than the first. Actors couldn't save the poor drama. I think ""ant man"" was too much in the marvel's world"
95,5,"Just not too fun They throw too much into this one. The first one was simple, small and doable. This film tries to follow the script of the first one but adds a bunch of junk just to make the plot progress and even random bad guys there just to have bad guys standing around when the main villain isn't on the screen. Sure, you can have multiple villains in a film but they need to be there for more believable reasons. Overall, a letdown."
96,6,"Nice Tribute to David Cassidy The film is bookended by the song ""Come On Get Happy"", which was the theme song for the TV series The Partridge Family. The series starred, and the lead singer on the song was David Cassidy, who passed away eight months before the film was released. Both this film and The Partridge Family we're set in San Francisco."
97,6,Average sequel The first ant man was amazing. The sequel is so not on the level of it. The story is average. It has too many villains. The screenplay is ok. The direction is good. The performances of the cast are amazing especially Scott's friends. The CGI and visual effects are terrific. Definitely not as good as the first but still watchable.
98,7,To focused on end game I enjoyed the film as a whole but I believe they were trying to get across the whole quantum realm theory too much in this film and forgot a little bit about the story. Still some funny parts in it and good action.
99,8,Meets The Expectations Marvel doesn't let you down in terms of entertainment. This movie has very good graphic visuals and amazing action scenes. And comedy too.This is regular MARVEL piece of work. Nothing is super excited about it.You simply Go....Watch...and Entertain Yourself.
100,9,"Pure Fun I couldn't believe the negativity of some of these reviews. You're going to see a movie about a superhero in an ant suit and you're expecting Ingmar Bergman? Thank heaven this was nothing like the preceding few Marvel films where we have to endure everything good being destroyed. After the heavy endings of Ragnarok and Infinity War, it was nice to have a light-hearted installment in the franchise, full of action, happy families, science, and the goofy characters we met in the first film. This was actually one of my favorites in the MCU series for just this reason. It's just pure entertainment from beginning to end. Enjoy it! Just turn it off after the initial end credits and before the bonus scene. Trust me on this one."
101,5,An very funny movie that's only okay Ant Man and the wasp is just fine with good performances and entertaining moments but however their are a lot of issues. While the acting is good and it's entertaining their is a lot of story issues with story all overall place and not that Interesting and basically as a follow to Infinity War which was one of the best marvel movies. Still the acting is good and it's funny it's only really blah. Overall grade= C+
102,9,"One of the best Avengers movies! I don't know how anyone could not love this movie!It's like top 3 avengers movies IMO.It's got good characters, good story and it's hilarious!A fun time for sure!"
103,3,"Ant Man and the Wasp Ant Man and the Wasp, directed by Peyton Reed, again, did everything you would expect in a sequel, but everything was very messy, forgettable and underwhelming. Ant Man and the Wasp didn't feel all that necessary to begin with; It strictly feels like a filler film, creating exposition for what's to come. The premise of the film is all over the place, trying to equally divide the importance, resulting in a repetitive, jumbled and cluttered narrative. The plots were extremely silly, while creating a few subplots, and plot holes . Reed and the creative team went for that small scale, light-hearted attempt again, but due to the small amount of tension, with the film being lazily crafted, the story fell flat!Ant Man and the Wasp had the best potential with developing, and introducing new characters, but due to the terrible writting, this film felt very crowded, and underdeveloped. Surprisingly, Evangeline Lilly as Wasp, was the star of this film! She was allowed a lot more character moments, compared to last time, where she was sidelined, and almost caged-in. Even though she isn't one of the most interesting characters the MCU has to offer, she is an investable character, because of her decently written back story, and motive. Paul Rudd had great potential to be developed nicely, after being introduced in such a likable way, but his character arch of the film, throws off his character for me. His character wasn't written as good as the first film, feeling like there was some conflicting opinions on the screenwriters side. His character was more or less, pushed to the side, to let Evangeline Lilly shine. The favorable, Michael Douglas returns as Hank Pym, but he really doesn't have that much to do in this film; he kind of just stands in the background, throwing his wit out there, here and again. Michael Pena, T.I, and David Dastmalchian return as their respective characters, and they're even worse than the first installment. They don't do much at all; they only cause more plot holes to arise. Abby Ryder Fortson is fine as Cassie, having this beautiful bond with Paul Rudd, while getting a little bit more to do this time around, but she still is strictly used as a plot device. As for the villains of the film, every single one of them are disposable! Laurence Fishburne is such a useless, predictable character, that adds no merit to the film, whatsoever. Walton Goggins runs the same lines as Fishburne, probably having even less to do, being severely underdeveloped. If you were to scratch the both of them, this film would not change. Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, had a lot of potential, but they took a lot of focus off of her, and tried to equally spread it, so it made her character go brutally underdeveloped. It's sad to say that her character is completely forgettable because, the Ghost character has a lot of cool aspects, that could've been included.The screenplay by Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, and Gabriel Ferrari, was very sloppy! They tried to do what every sequel does, and crank every aspect up a level, but they missed in every category. They tried to be way too smart with the science of everything, creating many plot holes, and stuff that just doesn't add up. The comedy of the film had a few okay moments, but it was really distracting overall, taking away a lot from what could've been captured.With a film like Ant Man, the opportunity for the action sequences to be great, are extremely high, but this film did not execute on that. Peyton Reed struggled to find a sense of style, creating these just subpar action scenes. The effects of the film were fine for the most part, but there are some moments were you can clearly tell they're using CG or a green screen.Overall, I feel like it's fair to say that Ant Man and the Wasp is one of, if not, the worst film of the Infinity Saga; completely lacking in every opportunity they had, that was handed to them on a silver platter."
104,5,Filler Filler total filler with a goofy dialogue and a mediocre story. The action and special effects are the highlights of this movie. The only decent bit is the end credits. This movie does not live up to the name of the MCU.
105,8,"QUANTUM REALM Scott Lang is on house arrest. Hank and Hope are mad at him for joining Cap in Civil War. There's some villainy, ghostly looking thing around,,, and large ants,, a couple of large ants.Evangeline, Evangeline,,, I'm so glad they gave you a better hairstyle that suits you so well in this movie (could not stand what they did to her in the first Antman,, while she still looked amazing, that hairstyle did not look good!!)"
106,8,"Fun superhero action These comments assume one has seen the first 'Ant-Man' film so don't need introductions to the characters or the technology that they use.As this film starts protagonist Scott 'Ant-Man' Lang is under house arrest following a misadventure with Captain America... he has only days before his sentence is over but inevitably circumstances force him out sooner. Dr Hank Pym and his daughter Hope 'Wasp' Van Dyne believe they have found a way to rescue Hope's mother, who was lost when she shrunk to the quantum level many years earlier. Of course it won't be easy; crooks are after Pym's technology to sell to the highest bidder; the FBI are after them and a former colleague of Pym's needs the technology to cure 'Ghost' a girl who has become unstable at the molecular level.I rather enjoyed this film; it never takes itself too seriously but still manages to avoid being silly. The story is solid and provides plenty of excuses for action. Thanks to impressive special effects the action scenes feel real even though characters, and even vehicles, are changing size. This size changing leads to a highly original car chase through the streets of San Francisco. The characters are solid with fine performances throughout; notably from Paul Rudd, as Lang; Evangeline Lilly as Hope; Michael Douglas, as Pym and Michael Peña as Luis, a colleague of Lang's. While the story is linked to other Marvel Superhero films the story is such that it can be enjoyed without watching them first... although obviously seeing the first 'Ant-Man' film is certainly a good idea. Overall I'd recommend this to those looking for a fun superhero film."
107,3,Not good The acting is terrible in this movie. Try and avoid at any cost.
108,3,"Nice action, weak men A lot of strong angry women and bunch of apologetic men, all asking permissions to do stuff around...."
109,8,"Much better than the original I am surprised by the reception of the Ant-Man films. I didn't like the first one but I love the second one. It seems that for everyone else, it is the other way around. To me, this is what the first film was trying to be. It has good humour, relatable characters and gripping action. The villain Ghost was interesting."
110,4,Waste of time... Such a forgettable movie. Mild humour - lame action. Only the post credit scene has any value
111,5,"First one is sooo much better Very disappointed by this movie. The first movie I rate higher than most MCU fans, I loved it.Antman and the Wasp is probably the weakest MCU film of all. Strange considering the same cast is involved. Best the movie offers is the schrink and grow action. Its done well, although even here the 1st movie felt better.In A&TW the plot is finding Pym's wife in the quantum realm. How to do this? A lot of talking to explain it. A machine with flashing lights. We dont see the lady untill the end of the movie when she cheaply also seem to have solution for the other plotline in the movie. Ghost is a very weak villain. She is not fleshed out, has little screentime and is not even intimidating really. She is emotionally weak and psysically so so. The other threats to our heroes are all too goofy to be taken serious. ' Why does everybody want the lab asked my 7yrold son?' Well because it has cool technology in it I replied... yeah...Our heroes were all very strong characters in the 1st movie but I struggle to feel for them in this one. Michael Douglas seems bored rather than inspired here. Antman/ Scott is almost a side character for comic relieve. In fact I see a movie full of side characters. And on top of it, to my adultbrain most of the humor doesnt even really land. Scotts friends were a lot funnier in the 1st movie. This movie feels very hollow. My young kids had fun with some of the scenes. I give the film some credits for that. Often the dialogue drags. The emotional weight here feels undeserved as we barely saw anything of the characters that need saving. Even the quantum realm disappointed me. I hoped they would really make it a character on its own. But we barely get to visit it and its visually not very creative.In most MCU ranking the films rates somewhere just below the middle of the list. I really dont see how Iron Man2 can me ranked lower than this to anyone. Yes that movie is flawed for reasons mentioned, but at least it has a strong maincharacter that really develops. At least the villains really stick in your brain. And when they are goofy then they really are.. Antman's first movie had a surprisingly well balanced mix of emotional weight and humor. All heroes get fleshed out, and the sidecharacters were funny while serving the plot. Even the often critisized cliche villain is a lot more rich than this poor poor Ghost-lady. He is woven a lot better in to the story and does feel like a real threat.Had to get this of my chest :)"
112,8,"Ant man and the wasp Movie was a lot of fun and a nice, comedic break from the dramatic heights of infinity war. Very funny with great action scenes and does a good job of further diving into the ""quantum realm"". Storyline a little inconsistent but over all great marvel movie!"
113,9,Awesome Sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp did a good job of taking the characters and plot from the first movie and expanding it to an even more interesting premise. A lot of the movie focuses around finding Hank Pym's wife and about the mysterious character Ghost stealing from Hank and the Wasp. This movie goes in an interesting direction making for a satisfying and lighthearted film after the more serious Infinity War.
114,7,Good movie This movie is related to other movies of the avenger series.This may give you some happiness.
115,7,"Marvel does... Snatch? I don't want to say Ant-Man and the Wasp is a mess... but it kinda is. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Ant-Man and really wanted to like this film. But the plot is just all over the place. The hardcore science and physics themes are forced into every scene and the word ""quantum"" is thrown around a load. Yet the writers fail miserably in helping us to understand even remotely any of the ""science"" that underpins the plot so crucially.The charm of the first Ant-Man came from its function as a heist film disguised as a superhero movie. This sequel lost all sense of that entertaining gimmick. With the inclusion of at least three different factions of bad guys it felt as though Ant-Man and the Wasp was trying to emulate the feats of a Guy Ritchie flick. Maybe I'm looking too much into that. Maybe Ant-Man and the Wasp wasn't trying to experiment in any other genre - maybe it was just unique nonsense.After all that harsh criticism, I still can't help but rate this sequel a respectable 7/10. Scott Lang genuinely makes me laugh, and a lot of the action scenes involving size shifting are great fun. An honourable mention must also be given to the post credits scene, which is shocking and incredibly effective in generating hype for Infinity War.I look forward to the third instalment in the Ant-Man series, which I hope steers away from the theme of incomprehensible science and serves the characters justice."
116,7,"Fun sequel Like the first Ant-Man film, this movie is fun and light, and I like it a lot."
117,7,"Not bad Greetings from Lithuania.I kinda enjoyed ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" (2018) more then i thought i will. It had cool characters, some legendary actors, nice special effects and pretty good pacing. This movie is not the biggest in this series, far from it, but not the worst either. Humor was OK as well its good intentions.Overall, i liked first parts a bit more, but this one was OK as well. Nothing that great, but not bad sci-fi adventure flick for a boring evening."
118,8,Successful Sequel!!! This sequel definitely lived up to what a sequel movie should be. The cast and supporting cast is just as good as the first movie in my opinion if not better. I love how Scott Lang aka Ant-Man is trying to redeem him self in the eyes of Hope and Hank throughout the movie. I also like the story line which takes place after Civil War. Even the villains in thus movie are great. All around this is an awesome sequel with great amount of action and comedy that we needed in this movie. Grade A movie!
119,1,it sucks This movie sucks only because of Evangeline Lilly. she is not the woman to play the hope character. she is so annoying and unloveable
120,9,"Super Dooper Fun Antedote in a Post-Infinity War World MCU is a work of genius. 3 Phases stretching back what seems like a generation. Phase 3 comes in two parts, which is a whacky idea in itself but I digress. Ant-man & The Wasp enters the scene after Infinity War but the action takes place at the same time. Releasing it after IW provides a moment of light relief following the tragic events of its predecessor. Michael Douglas & Laurence Fishburne have a few great moments, sparring with each other for laughs. Rudd pitches the comedy just right. He could've gone for over the top excess but he keeps a lid on it and so strikes a good balance between the moments of seriousness & the comical. Evangeline Lilly, is a particular fave of mine. She's a good choice for Pym's daughter. My only complaint is, the scenes of Lilly on the beach in her bikini were cut, supposedly to get the 12 cert (only joking). The supporting cast have a few enjoyable comedy scenes. Pena & Goggins play their parts with aplomb. The former is his usual over the top self and the latter plays the likeable baddy. Hank Pym is an abusive wife besting egotist in the comic books but here Douglas drops the abusive trait and plays up Pym's cantankerous, grumpy arrogant side. It all works really well. From the over officious, incompetent Feds and characterful giant ants, to great SFX and a fast paced screenplay. I wouldn't normally find anything for 12 year olds remotely funny but I found myself laughing at all the right moments. If you like good fun action movies with a comedic sensibility them this movie will tick all your boxes. The kids will love it too so what's not up like?"
121,1,"Mindless, style over substance, no story, going through the long dragged out motions. Don't waste your time. They just want your cash and perhaps to waste your time (and I like bad movies. This is just pretentious new-age garbage)."
122,9,Not as Good but still Good The need to make this a Wasp centred movie means the plot suffers but I get it and I like the sub PlotI miss the guys and the extend family a lot and the into of the missing is not goodThe new characters are all fantastic though and definitely bring the movie forwardThe CGI and FX/Stunts are on a whole new level really its mind blowing to watch and truly surpasses anything else including Thor and CapThe first film flows better here we have two/three ideas nicely meshed but the Wasp back story very necessary but it doesn't flow as well as the rest of the ideasBut this is a winner up ther with Black Panther and Thor Ragnarök
123,6,"Not as good as the first one. Another good film from Marvel, but not as good as the first Ant Man. The jokes seemed too similar to the first movie and made it hard to stay funny again, e.g. Michael Pena retelling stories with too much detail. Jokes aren't funny when you know what the punch line is. So the movie didn't seem to branch out from what it had already established.Evangeline finally sorted her hair out, that wig was a bit outrageous.A big problem also with both movies was how ridiculously quick all of the superheroes put their costumes on. Literally in seconds, to put on skin tight leather. If Ross Geller from Friends taught us anything it was that getting in and out of tight leather is no quick fix. This would be a matter of minutes not seconds like the movie seems to suggest!This movie is okay not great"
124,6,Hannah John-Karen is a awful actress Both female leads in this film are so bad. They take a somewhat okay script and beat it to death.
125,3,"it sucks Euw it was so boring and the chick that played the wasp was to old, they should've cast a young woman. it would make more sense"
126,8,"Funny After the depressing bloodbath that was Infinity War, we needed something lighthearted to make us feel better, and this film delivered. It had all the humor of the first one, but also knew when it needed to be serious. Some of the running jokes do get old after the 4th time, but some still work. The action sequences are some of the most fun I've seen this year. The villain, while very cool, did some kind of generic in terms of motivation, and I saw the twist coming. Many people were worried this was going to be SJW propaganda, but it is not. It does what ""Incredibles 2"" should have done. There were too many villains in this movie, too. I think Marvel, in terms of villains, is starting to suffer from DC-itis. Overstuffing the movie with too many characters just for fanservice. There is also one moment in the film where there is a race against time, and when the time runs out...nothing happens, thus rendering the stakes useless. Overall, it was about on par with the first movie, and still had lots of great humor. If you want to see a superhero movie that's borderline parody, but never quite that, than this is the film. Grade: B 8/10 4/5 stars"

128,10,"Really a joy to watch So many things to like about this movie. 1) I can take my kids to see it. 2) The humor is really funny. 3) The interaction between characters is both believable, and sometimes goofy. 4) The action and fight scenes are very good. 5) A character is given a moral dilemma and makes a positive choice (Fishburne). And more. The physics is way off - duh. But we don't see Marvel movies for their adherence to physics. :)"
129,7,"It's only entertainment and I like it, yes I do... Simple, mindless, fun, action pumped entertainment. What else can I say. If you liked Ant Man before, this will rock your boat as well.Anything special worth mentioning? I loved Michelle Pfeifer's contribution. She even looked 30-ish again through computer youthification. Great.Watch out (again) for the several added scenes that can only be seen during the end credits."
130,7,"The film relies on the perfect timing for Paul Rudd's comedy, even more at ease as the hero and the fighting skills of Evangeline Lilly and brings some advances to the Marvel ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is the first film after the acclaimed ""Avengers, Infinite War"", and is a breath in the midst of so much megalomania of one of the greatest super-productions in the history of cinema. Here is the big question - Was the decision to star in a movie with those characteristics right now? Not that we could expect anything very different from what was presented earlier. Humor and scenes playing with the proportionality of objects is the main feature of the previous film, which remains even higher in this production. However, it is inevitable to think that there has been a decline in the quality of films, from a major historical blockbuster to a ""minor"" comedy film, without memorable action scenes. There are no global threats, let alone intergalactic ones - the motivations here are personal.The film fits very little into the universe of ""Avengers, Infinite War"" - the link here is much more intense with ""Captain America, Civil War"". Convicted of breaking the Sokovia Treaty in the emblematic airport battle, Scott Lang has been under house arrest for two years, with three more probations. Thus, he had to take a break from his life as a superhero until, with just three days left to leave the house, he had a strange dream about Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), the original Vespa, who was lost in the world quantum for thirty years. One call is enough and the trio formed by Lang, Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) is reunited.The film shows how Scott Lang seeks to make up for time behind bars and increasingly seeks to bond with his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), even under house arrest when he was forced to put aside the life of a hero. It is important how this relationship is portrayed and how Scott's daughter sees him as a hero, being very important to her father during the time he was trapped inside the house. When Scott is not with his daughter, he spends his time playing drums, reading, learning magic, singing in karaoke. Meanwhile, Hope already makes her first appearance as the Wasp, making a super creative rescue at Scotts home.The Wasp, incidentally, is the first heroine to put her name in the title of a Marvel movie, and is just as important as Ant-Man. The heroine stars in good action sequences, in addition to building with her father a tunnel with a direct connection to the quantum kingdom, in which they hope to find and rescue her mother after decades, for this she negotiates the purchase of the materials she needs for the construction of the tunnel with Sonny Burch, who works on the black market for technology. The action sequence that takes place in a restaurant in which she struggles with the Burch gang is one of the best ever seen and the Vespa shows that she has everything to be one of the main female characters for future features in the Marvel universe.Director Peyton Reed makes this sequence a great comedy film. Now participating since the beginning of the sequence and not entering as a last-minute replacement as in the first film, the director manages to print his brand adding many layers of humor, but ends up forgetting the action. We have some isolated action scenes, but very creative and well built, where the idea of ""increase"" and ""decrease"", already explored in ""Civil War"" in an intelligent way, is also well used. The sense of scale was already one of the positive points of the previous film, this improves in the continuation: the miniature world has its rules, as well as gigantism. The visual effects are so well used that they either cause admiration or make you laugh at the ingenuity of the situation, like the first reduction in Dr. Hank's laboratory; Hello Kitty that turns into a big weapon; the car that throws another when it grows; and the giant Ant-Man on the hunt in a bay.From the connections between their different nuclei of characters. Whether it's Scott and his daughter Cassie, Hope and his parents (Hank / Janet), and finally, Bill Foster and Ava - Ghost's real name, there is a constant concern on the part of the writers to develop palpable emotional relationships that, in fact, captivate the audience. With the total absence of a great villain, the script for Ant-Man and the Wasp has the cleverness (here yes) to dilute the antagonism in three completely different axes - but all with the same objective: to steal Dr ""portable laboratory"" Hank Pym.The first has the bow of Dr. Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne), Hank's former disaffection, and the Phantom (the one who in the comics is a man and here is very welcome in the interpretation of Hannah John-Kamen), who seeks a cure for his painful powers; the second is led by an underutilized Walton Goggins as criminal dealer Sonny Burch; and the third led by agent Woo (Randall Park) - who never appears on the scene with any seriousness, having his arc of tension impaired. Complementing the cast, as in the previous film, Scott's friend Luis (Michael Pena) steals most of the scenes in which he appears. Another of the retired criminals, Kurt (David Dastmalchian), also gains hilarious moments.Overall, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" relies on the perfect timing for Paul Rudd's comedy, even more at ease as the hero and the fighting skills of Evangeline Lilly and brings some advances to the Marvel universe, with a story which presents pieces that should be important to solve the questions that the events of the end of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" left open. The film, if not thrilled by the action and the seriousness of the situations presented, it certainly amuses and expands several aspects presented in the previous film, now without the need to ""waste time"" to introduce the character. In the post-credit scene, we have practically the film's only link to ""Infinite War"", which will certainly have an impact on the future appearance of the character in Avengers, Endgame""."
131,6,"Another unnecessary sequel Ant-Man was an interesting surprise. Marvel tends to be caught up with its main characters, and it struggles for relevant side characters. It would've been nice to have a Hank Pym early storyline, and saved this for the sequel. This sequel is only setting up the storyline for Avengers Endgame. The villain is not that interesting, and is another one note villain. The film was fun, just not as fun as the previous film."
132,7,"Pretty entertaining movie This movie was a decent one time watch. Even though on its own, it's not as good as its prequel but since it's a part of Marvel universe you wouldn't regret watching it."
133,5,It just stole things from the first one This movie stole things from the first wonderful movie. The only thing it did different was give us Morpheus as a forgettable villain. No one was invested in either the heroes or the villain
134,7,"Mostly good, but had its moments... This movie is so cute, funny and adorable. After seeing Infinity War it kinda brings your spirit up a little bit.This movie has so many dad moments from Ant-Man, they're absolutely adorable. The humor in this movie is pretty good. They overall concept of the movie is thought out and the visuals are amazing.However, I feel as though the bad guy (Ghost) is down played so much. The conflicts are solved too fast: The bad guy and and good guy fight for no reason to only end up wanting the same thing. There should have been more conflict."
135,7,"Ant-Man and The Wasp is everything the first film should have been and is better in every regard. That doesn't make it anything more than a minor entry and a rather slight film, but with that come the advantages of being able to be a light, warm-hearted reprieve from the necessary bombast and drudgery of Infinity War. And while Ant-Man was a terribly good film in any way, the fact that his film excels it completely is a welcome surprise. The idea behind some scenes are hilarious (see: Truth Serum) and it manages to add Lawrence Fishburne to the MCU, it doesn't overuse Michael Pena, and it allows Evangeline Lily to kick ass without seeming to be cloying or misguided like some other superhero films with strong female characters. I laughed a lot, some of the gags and some of Rudd's line readings had me in absolute stitches. Peyton's chops as a comedy director are finally fully swinging here and Dante Spinotti manages to make every plain and every day setting feel rich and sumptuous alongside the effortlessly superb production design. Ant-Man and The Wasp, despite the titular Wasp now, actually feels like Paul Rudd has some breathing room and focus this time and although it never seems particularly expensive, it never strains against its budget like some other CGI heavy Marvel entries. All in all, against all odds, Ant-Man and the Wasp manages to be simple, good honest fun and in the MCU, that already puts it up in the bottom of the top pile. I'll definitely be seeing it again."
136,8,"Grand Opening of a new reality the quantum realm entanglement in the Multiverse Hypothesis Still reeling from events from cival war. Scott lang is enlisted again by Hank Pym for an urgent new mission .As Scott Lang balances being both a superhero and a father, Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym present an urgent new mission that finds the Ant-Man fighting alongside The Wasp to uncover secrets from their pass So with a new machine been built suits that absorb the Multiverse and quantum So as fbi and others after Pym paticules so as we see Pym tech can shrink building miniture car chases around San Francisco and large ant man throwing the office around as ghost looks for a cure. As the fbi chase lang there is giant ant man pushing the van around the streets as ghost wants the machine that has shrunk as she battles with wasp and ant man He must once again put on the suit and learn to fight alongside the wasp as they join forces to defeat ghost and being home a loved one from the quantum realm Ghost was a baseline human in the comics who got his powers from the suit. The MCU version is an enhanced human who got her powers from an accident; the suit helps her manage them. Janet van Dyne is a complex example of the trope. In the comics she is a baseline human who later got additional abilities to shoot bio-energy blasts, but here is a baseline human who derives her powers from the suit. Initially, at least. Her time in the Quantum Realm has given her additional powers that she cited as being ""evolution"". This film takes place at the same time as showing the implications of Thanos' actions.This implies that the film is an interquel, taking place during the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018).The majority of the film prior to that, however, takes place several days earlier (possibly weeks): it stands to reason that the final montage, showing Hank and Janet as well as Scott and Hope rekindling their relationships, takes place over at least a few days (not to mention Hank and Janet needing some time to build a miniature quantum tunnel). Enjoy the fun before Infinity War and endgame"
137,6,Solid and Fun Everything you would expect from a Paul Rudd/ Ant-Man film.
138,6,"Fun sequel with inventive action ANT-MAN AND THE WASP is the inevitable come-down from AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, released as the next movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. This one tells a condensed, stand-alone and seemingly small-scale adventure which also serves to explain Ant-Man's absence from the prior epic. The story draws in interesting science and uses quantum physics to tell a rip-roaring adventure yarn with shades of INNER SPACE, FANTASTIC VOYAGE and many others. Paul Rudd dials down the comedy here and is better for it, although the film does suffer from having a generic villain with little presence. Still, Michael Douglas and Laurence Fishburne are solid in support, and the size-changing action sequences never disappoint, particularly the outrageous car chase towards the climax."
139,7,"I Enjoyed It I just rewatched AntMan & The WaspI just love Paul Rudd, and I love him even more as Scott Lang, he is like the Roccky of this Universe!! The little underdog you root for. Evangeline Lilly is good as is Hannah John Kamen as Ava/Ghost but although the movie is an enjoyable palette cleanser after the dramatics of Avengers: Infinity War again it has a weak villain!! After Thanos and Killmonger in Black Panther, it's a step back.Random side note!! Laurence Fishburn is in both Marvel and DC Cinematic Universe's at the same time lol"
140,7,The first one is much better This is good but not great this is 2 stars under the first one
141,6,"This movie was funny, fun-loving and cool story-line (Scott) Ant-man and (Hope) the wasp team up to re-discover there past and they encounter all these obstacles. Hope (the wasp) is a badass nonetheless. Scott (ant man) is brave, insightful and all and all he just wants to make a difference. That's what superheros are for, aren't they? But he was put on house arrest, by a crime he committed while doing his heroic work. Because of this, he had to sneak in and out of his home to fight for what he, hope and hope's daughter, father hank believed in. (Throughout the movie this is apparent.) Because of this incident, Scott was basically thought of as a failure amongst the general superheros of this movie. (Not that this movie was for him to prove himself,) and quite frankly that would have been boring because that's all they ever do in movies that focus on heroism!They focused more on Hope's past, the goal was to find her mother, that whom she found out was still alive after 30 years. Geez if I found that out, about my mother I would be on my knees crying, clapping my hands of peace and joy then having been filled with vast determined determination SPARKKK would have said ""WHERE IS SHE""? ORRRRRRRrr.... ""WE HAVE TO FIND HER!"" and carried ON to find my mother! Bunch of whoohoos!And obviously what comes with heroism is facing the daunting villains and general evil, and with this I gotta to say it was two sided (you'll see). So ant man & the wasp were trying to get this case, the prototype if you will. And It turned out a lot more people wanted this prototype for themselves. A business man who had his hands on it first. Hope bargained him for it, her not fulfilling his extra wishes decided to keep it along selfishly, and intended on keeping her money. But she wasn't going to let this happen. She stole it from him and then a fight brewed out. And she fought for her life! After that, this man continuously tried to get it back from her at all costs, and I mean at all costs. He was a selfish evil man only doing for himself threatening to kill to get his way, you just know he would have done it.The other evil in this movie was one of more lightheartedness if you ask me. This young women had a softer side, and wasn't always this mean. She got introduced by swooping in and fighting vigorously for the prototype. (But she had reasons). She had gotten this let's call it 'cursed', and because of this 'curse' she couldn't feel physically, her body literally was in this fog. She was in DEEP pain because of this all, from her body not truly being there. (That's why she could jet through walls :) cool!). She experienced turmoil from this, and that prototype she felt was the only thing to help her. Some of the characters preferably Bill offered her other options at how to solve her problem, but she recklessly enraged on doing it her way. She attempted to get the prototype the whole movie and because of doing it her own way selfishly, she hurt a lot of people in the process and really didn't care. Her character was reckless and pretty revengeful. I hold compassion for her and her actions, though I do not believe in getting cold and escalating revenge. I understand her actions. Bill helped her throughout her tribulation. Even when they probably went to prison he was there for her until the end!This movie had a more interesting approach, different than most superhero movies I've encountered. While it's more comedic, it's not in a dumb way. The story never portrayed dumb ness in anyway possible. This different approach was introduced when watching this movie.Honestly the acting was phenomenal. The effects of this movie (when ant man turned into tiny male, and made his car go bye bye it was clean) the effects were believable. (That's just me: Typically I find with movies the effects to be irregular or just over the top. Not with this one.)There was a draft of romance here & there, but it was firmly placed. Ant-Man and the Wasp was very comedic. it was very diplomatic and with that being said you already know it was not too cocky. It portrayed in it, a sense of lightheartedness even when the problem arose. That's a real accomplishment especially in the movie business where so many like to make a MOLE out of a mole hole. The romantic scenes were not over the top, (Most movies, I find them entails romantic entries, or movies about romance, they take it too far.) And how they made the scenes that did have romantic attributes was real smooth and not conflicting with the story-line.This had a SOLID story-line. Although this movie can appear boring from behind the scenes (watching the graphics, and the talking and the scenes flash by) there is something about it makes it so watchable, I just didn't want to stop looking.It was a pretty good movie. I would suggest watching this, especially if your into all this superheros stuff, and you want some true genuineness in the heros themselves yet with not all the gushy stuff."
142,2,"Not ResonAnt Marvel's had a good run of films that are visually stunning and overall fun. Unfortunately, neither of these two factors are necessary in making a film stand the test of time, and nothing better epitomizes this than Ant-Man and the Wasp.Where Ant-Man came close to emotional moments that are upended by excessive comedy and a lack of faith in the writing, the sequel fails to have likeable characters in the first place. The main cast has been completely Flanderized. Hank Pym goes from being a grumpy man with heart to being an almost malicious entity. He lacks any compassion or empathy in this movie for the most part, and it's played for laughs because the audience is just supposed to think Scott's this generic dumb TV dad at this point even though he was clever and talented in the first movie.Speaking of bad characters, I cannot sympathize with the antagonist at all. Well, sure, I can at first before she goes sicko mode. The climax of the film is incredibly contrived and there's no reason for the villain to act so villainous at this point, and at this point she doesn't deserve the redemption she's granted at the end of the movie.The special effects are nice, sure, but I don't watch movies for their special effects. We all know bad effects can pull you out of a story, but for me good effects cannot fix a terrible story. I'm tired of people praising these films for their effects. It should say something that no one praises this film for its writing.Only watch this film if you are an Ant-kin."
143,7,"LIGHT HEARTED FUN WITH LOW STAKES Following Avengers: Infinity War, this films stakes were nowhere near as high and was there just to fill up some space before Avengers: Endgame. It may not be a film intending to be one of the bests but it is a very welcomed, small scale fun adventure. Introducing The Wasp in battle was a great addition as was a further look into the Quantum Realm which will later play a big part in the MCU. Bringing back Janet Van Dyne can only hold questions about what might happen in the future of the MCU. Overall this film is very fun to watch but not exactly one that is very memorable."
144,3,"Incoherence reigns You get three movies in one with this, and not a single one of them is terribly satisfying.Scott Lang is in the final days of his house arrest after violating the Sokovia Accords (steep price there) and has a flash of vision that prompts him to call Hank Pym and his daughter Hope. He saw a woman he thought was Hope's mother. They promptly kidnap him because he could be a key in their experiments they are performing to try and get to the Quantum Realm and save her.But wait! There's more! Hank and Hope need one final piece of generic quantum tech to make their machine work (how it worked before this piece of tech...), and this bad guy (played by one of my favorite character actors Walton Goggins) has figured out that Hank and Hope are sitting on a lab full of high tech things he could steal from them and sell to his other customers on the black market. So, he loses the tech to them and then chases them.But wait! There's more! There's also a mystery character dressed in gray who fazes in and out of our level of reality who fights Scott and Hope for the tech (which she fails to get from them). This is a girl who's slowly being torn apart for various nonsense technical reasons (involving the word quantum a lot). She barely affects the plot but shows up a whole lot to give speeches and do cool things in action sequences that don't really affect anything.Sitting through this, I wondered what the story actually was. The only story that actually affects our three characters is Hank, Hope, and Scott trying to get Hope's mother from the Quantum Realm, but they have the ability to get her back within half an hour. They obviously can't get her back too soon because that's the sole central conflict and if they did that then the movie would be over. Instead, they get unrelated problems thrown at them (like Goggins and the ghost) who delay the inevitable. It feels like the original script of this was just Goggins and the core three because Goggins actually does most of the distraction and mischief making. He provides the tech at the beginning, turns on them, chases them, and involves the FBI. The final action sequence even ends with Lang getting a miniaturized building from Goggins. The ghost feels completely extraneous like they looked at the original script, realized it was only 80 pages long, and added in a new character to blow it up to two hours. Instead of fixing the fact that there are no real obstacles to accomplishing their goal by the thirty minute mark, the writers just threw more obstacles at them.It makes the whole affair frustrating to watch. The first Ant-Man wasn't exactly a good movie, but it wasn't the worst way to introduce a new ridiculous character starring a charming leading man, but this follow up is even a disappointment with that in mind. I like Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Walton Goggins, and Randall Park in this. They're charming people and entertaining to watch work off of each other. The problem is that they're just floating there with no story to tie any of it down. Even the bright colorful special effects of the Quantum Realm feel detached from anything else, especially the actors who never interact with anything in it and feel like they're just standing in front of green screens."
145,6,"Nice Ant-Man and the Wasp (in Brazil and Portugal, Homem-Formiga e a Vespa) is a 2018 US film based on Marvel Comics characters Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope van Dyne / Vespa. Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, being the sequel to Ant Man, 2015, and the 20th film in the Marvel Cinematographic Universe. Directed by Peyton Reed and written by Paul Rudd with the teams of Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers and Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, it stars Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña, Tip ""T.I."" Harris, Judy Greer, David Dastmalchian, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, Hannah John-Kamen, Randall Park and Walton Goggins. In Ant-Man and the Wasp, Lang partners with van Dyne to embark on a new Pym mission. The film has the familiar theme, humor and various possibilities involving the objects and the people themselves. However the main goal is to make you laugh: not by chance, the core involving Luis and his huge team gets more space with extended jokes. The script is incomplete and its inability to give any inconsistency to the story itself. The quantum kingdom has beautiful scenes almost the same as Doctor Strange; despite being more exploited by the mysterious tone than proper. In the first scene pro-credits reveal little. So my movie grade is 6.0.Movie seen on April 22, 2019"
146,3,"Cringeworthy sillyness I guess you could just view this movie as a bit of a lark, nothing to be taken seriously, but as a physicist I found that exceedingly difficult. I kept noting the ridiculous violations of the fundamental laws of physics and it largely prevented me from enjoying the film. Suspension of disbelief can only work up to a point."
147,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Ant-Man and the wasp is another fun little film but not on the same level as the first. Paul Rudd is great and Evangeline Lilly heats more to do in this film and she is amazing. It still funny, but the villain isn't too interesting and plot isn't as strong. The film overall doesn't feel as fresh as the first. It's still a good entertaining movie.7.4/10"
148,9,"Solid Comedic Action Movie After the massive hit by infinity war this was a fun light hearted movie, I liked the action and the jokes in the film they are really funny and always Paul Rudd as Ant-Man is fantastic but The Wasp was probably the main focus of this movie but she was still really good! All in all I think it is a entertaining sequal Fun for the whole Family 8/10"
149,9,family In my opinion it's funnier than the first one and it's more entertaining for the family must watch
150,7,"Here's hoping they Taiki Waititi the last installment Ant-Man and the Wasp is a conundrum for me. I wanna love it, but I'm just not into it. The best way to review this movie is this: taken on its own, it's a good enough movie. But as the 20th MCU installment, right after Infinity War and even just as a sequel to the first Ant-Man film, if you look hard enough you'll see its shortcomings. And to a certain degree you can blame the director and the writers, after reading a summary of the movie's development it seemed they have accepted their fate as MCU's official void-filler: the first came right after the highly successful Avengers: Age of Ultron, and now the sequel right after the insanely successful Avengers: Infinity War, which is now the fourth highest-grossing movie of all time.Maybe the decision to work on a scaled-down movie right after the Avengers is a strategy, to bring the tone down again just enough to keep people interested then slowly build it up again until the next Avengers movie comes out. It is hard to keep busting out high-powered movies one after the other and at the same time expect the audience to not get exhausted. And the best person for the job that requires the just enough amount of interest is Ant-Man, so much so that he needed a companion the Wasp (Yay for equal billing.) Ant-Man alone wouldn't have worked the second time around, they were lucky the last time considering they gave us a half-baked first movie marred by multiple production issues.The pros: Paul Rudd is still charming and relatable as Ant-Man, Evangeline Lilly delivered as the Wasp, Michael Douglas is still giving Oscar-worthy performance with barely anything to work on, and they found him a worthy equal in Michelle Pfeiffer. Michael Pena is given again his moment to shine, the ants are still weirdly lovable, and we get to see THE Giant Man for the second time.The cons: Yay for a second female villain, Nay as she was written more as an accessory for the movie to have a villain which they could've actually done away with if the writers just focused on how life was for the protagonists right after the events of Civil War. Unlike the Avengers, these folks are regular people who still need to go back to their normal day-to-day meandering lives. Speaking of Civil War, I echo the director's sentiment about losing a moment for their franchise when Giant-Man made his debut in CW instead of theirs.Here's hoping they Taiki Waititi the last installment and who knows maybe that can be another MCU thing strategy they can use in the future."
151,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) Ant-Man and the Wasp is a typical Marvel movie based on Scheme f. The movie is an entertaining superhero movie with a gigantic potion effect that is good, a forgiving counterpart and an irrelevable plot that is well entertained.7,0"
152,10,Love it way better than the first I love this film i watched it in cinema twice and dvd a few its just so good and paul rudd is the best casting choice for antman cant imagine anyone else playing him
153,4,"Disappointing. I'm going to say right away that I really enjoyed the first Ant-Man. I'm not really a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I've only seen about half of the movies and I've only really liked about half of that, but Ant-Man is up there with my favourites. It was the most fun movie I had seen in a while! That being said, I did not enjoy Ant-Man and The Wasp very much. There were way too many characters with way too much going on for what should've been a pretty simple story, it was too long, everything was all grey, and the action scenes I thought paled in comparison to the first movie. My favourite part of the first movie was all the creative things they did with all the growing and the shrinking in the action sequences. They didn't do a lot of that in the sequel. I don't really know what happened. The same people who made the first movie also made this. What made the first movie so good but the sequel so underwhelming? Was it what was left over from the original Edgar Wright version? Was it my expectations being too high? Are they just running out of steam with these movies? I can't put my finger on it. There were some things that I enjoyed, like the comedy, the performances, and the post-credits scenes, but that's about it. I found this movie very dull and quite disappointing. Check it out if you're a die-hard Marvel fan, skip it otherwise and just watch the post-credits scenes online somewhere. That's all you really need as far as context for the other movies goes."
154,4,Bad Just what the heck it was bad and I just watched it because of the sequels
155,5,"Uninspired I like Paul Rudd and all, everyone does, but this movie was just uninteresting to me. It was cool that they continued the story and were trying to find the mom but in the grand scheme of things who cares? Why is this the movie right before End Game? Maybe if this wasn't in marvel it'd be more entertaining. I wound up only half focused on the movie but I gave it a good shot before I kind of tuned out."
156,6,"Where's the team work? Ant-Man and The Wasp RATING: 3.1/5Ant-Man and The Wasp: Wasted Potential, that's what this movie should be called. I really thought director Peyton Reed was going to be able to cut loose without being constrained to what Edgar Wright had already laid out in the first Ant-Man, but clearly i was wrong. All the action scenes are literally in the trailers, why would you ever do that? It's so bad, that even part of the final post credit scene is briefly in one of the trailers, it's like a total slap in the face after sitting there waiting til the very end. You have Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, Evangeline Lilly, for all intents and purposes, this is an All Star cast who are given almost nothing to work with. Oh, and you can forget about any of the previously established science working like they said it did. Hell, they even establish something in this movie just to contradict themselves later on. The screen writers and directors need to be let go because they clearly aren't interested in making a good film about the Ant-Man and Wasp characters, on almost any level.Let's talk about some of the good stuff. The Quantum Realm is pretty amazing looking, its a little similar to the Dark Dimension in the Doctor Strange movie but with a lot more going on. It feels like you're in another reality that has actual life in it, something i wish they had explored more. The action scenes are pretty good but again, you've already seen them all in the trailers, so there's nothing new to see. The beginning of the movie really plays up the fact that Scott Lang is a dad, who just happens to be a superhero. It helps to frame Scott as kind of an every man, a real underdog, and i think that's where the character's strength lies. Scott even manages to remain friends with his ex-wife and her new husband, cementing what a good guy Scott is. His daughter is a pretty level headed kid and you get a good sense that she really believes in her dad when almost no one else in the movie really does. That dynamic really should have been paralleled better with Hank and Hope's father, daughter, relationship, but again, another missed opportunity. The Wasp is as badass as we were led to believe in the first film. In fact, she's such a badass that Ant-Man feels dumbed down and sometimes even pointless when he's with her... might as well get into the bad now.I remember this movie being sold as a romantic comedy at one point, well it definitely is not. The chemistry between Hope and Scott is non-existent, and they're not really funny together either. Despite the badassness of The Wasp, character wise, Hope really isn't given much to do emotionally. I kept waiting for some sort of personality or genuine emotion to shine through, but Evangeline Lilly was given nothing to work with. You could argue the movie is about family, but everything is set up so poorly that you just don't feel emotionally invested in the search for Hank Pym's wife, Janet, or even the well-being of Scott's own makeshift family. The villains are practically throwaways. Rather than getting a main villain and a sub villain, you're given two sub villains that don't amount to anything in the end. Ghost had real potential to be a solid villain, they show you her backstory and what she used to do and you think she may be a real credible threat. Nope, all the cool stuff she does is in the trailer, nothing more to see. Hell, i saw a tweet saying that Walton Goggins villainous character should have been replaced by Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer, and i have to agree. Hammer is an established, main, villain, which most fans like, and his weapons are apparently far reaching as they've appeared in the Marvel Netflix shows on the Black Market. He's the most organic choice for a villain with the story they have here, but again, this film is about wasted potential and missed opportunities.Ultimately, the film isn't terrible, it's just painfully average, with a lot of poorly thought out story choices. Average wouldn't be bad except that the last 3 Marvel Studios movies were Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, all movies that are working on a whole other level, whereas Ant-Man and The Wasp just reminds you what Marvel Studios used to be, and not in a good way. It almost feels as if Ant-Man and The Wasp got held back a grade or something, while everyone else graduated and moved on to the next. Maybe if i hadn't seen all the action scenes in the trailers, i would have had a better experience, but that doesn't change the fact that the story is spread way too thin despite having a simpler premise and way lower stakes. Hell, the stakes are so low that you're never worried about them not pulling it off in the end. As it stands, there's not much else here outside the action scenes. This really does feel like a step back for Marvel Studios, they're better than this now. Ant-Man and The Wasp is simply unacceptable at this point, and they need to go back to the drawing board if they plan on making another one... painfully average. Smh 😒"
157,6,"If a movie becomes too small it can disappear Ant-man isn't one of my favorites in the MCU: this movie consolidated my position. An extra-chapter that doesn't preclude necessarily to the vision of the followings and at the same time says few things to who have seen the previous. If the general MCU mood is bringing, often, the superheroistic movie more and more on the level of action movies and less on the level of the introspection of heroes in jumpsuit (as did, for example, Raimi's ""Spiderman""), ""Ant-man and the Wasp"" obeys to this tendency. The plot is based on few essential props and we have the impression, sometimes, that the almost two hours of movie are full of stopgaps: the introduction of Wasp doesn't enrich much, I think, what Ant-man alone could already say; instead it falls in the trite couple of lovers that discover the feeling toward the fight. ""Senza arte né parte"": the MCU's prunable branches."
158,10,"Just a load of fun A solid and thoroughly entertaining to Marvel's Ant-Man. Packed with action, humour, romance, great special effects, and sci-fi elements, it is an awesome movie that I highly recommend."
159,4,"It may not be the worst movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it comes a bit close. Ant-Man and the Wasp is yet again one of the weakest MCU movies and proves that Ant-Man can work way better as a character if he's with the Avengers (Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Endgame are proof of that). There is so much potential to make a great Ant-Man movie and explore some very interesting and cool concepts / ideas, but everytime they waste those opportunities, so that they can make the most generic movie of the year, instead of being very original or taking some risks, but that doesn't mean that i hate it. It's just that i feel disappointed by it, like many movies that are coming out very mediocre or bad that i can clearly see what they could have been like."
160,6,An okay time tbh pretty boringvillain is not that greatpremise is there just not well executedfirst one was leagues better
161,7,"beastly without being epic Beastly movie. entertaining and fast paced. fun and funny. some really awesome, low-key action. the MCU is so unbelievably consistent. another strong movie to add to the list. lots of awesome new uses for the abilities. a cool villain that i wish i saw more of (3 viewings, 5/14/2020)"
162,7,Ant-Man and the Wasp 7/10 - fun follow up that offers both laughs and action
163,9,Better than the first Ant-man I love this movie even more than Ant-man 2015. The Wasp is a good addition and all returning characters are great. Funnier than the first one too. Ghost is not necessarily a villain but a foil through out. Love Ghost's backstory and powers and suit. Sunny Birch is nothing special but I love the way Walton Goggins plays him. The side story of Scott trying to stay out of trouble is great and the main story of getting back Janette is great. Love Scott's and his ex-wife's and her husband's and Cassie's relationship. The whole car chase in San Fransico is AWESOME. And that mid-credit scene is so goooooood!
164,8,"Its smaller and better than ever Ant man and the wasp is ant man 2.0. The perfect sequel, upping the humor and the villians. You actually care about what's happening and having a lot of fun along the way. The jokes in this land better than most marvel movies, and the motivations are genuine and interesting. A good emotional relief from infinty war. Pena is a big highlight and the daughter is as cute as ever. 82%"
165,10,"Such A Great Film! Antman and The Wasp was such a great movie!!! A wonderful overall cast and storyline!!! I throughly enjoyed it!!! The same cast came back to portray their characters along with a few great characters. It's funny, it has its dark moments, sadness, love blossoming!!! Great movies do well with those things listed above!!! A++ Film."
166,7,"Funny and enjoyable but too confusing to be a great Marvel entry This is a fun McGuffin story and light-hearted return after the darker Infinity War, but the sad truth is that the jokes are about all this movie has going for it. The story relies too much on a science that no one really understands. It would be one thing to have one scene about quantum physics, explain it in sci-fi terms and move on, but instead the plot hinges on it even into the finale. Despite this the movie plays it off for laughs with Scott being in our same position every time, but instead of laughing, I am just as confused as Scott. This one film that is saved by the Marvel formula of action and quips with great actors."
167,3,An Unnecessary MCU Entry It is really just a placeholder film in the MCU with very little new ideas to bring to the table. Top that off with an incredibly lazy ending and Ant-man and the Wasp ends the amazing streak of Marvels phase 3 lineup.
168,8,Very very good Never been part of the group that loves Superhero craze and never bought into the love affair with America and Paul Rudd and this changed both parts. I do lean towards comedy so all SH movies might not work for me. The other enormous plus in this movie was Michael Pena hated Chips but that was more Dax Shepard and I've liked Randall Park in every thing he has done. This was fun and I watched this only as compromise with the family and tried not to show my enjoyment so I wouldn't be made to watch every SH movie for the rest of my life but failed.
169,8,"The kind of Marvels I like. I think it's a smart move from Marvel to put some funny moments in their movies. Deadpool and Ant-Man are difinitely the Marvel movies I preferred. The humor in those movies combined with the superhero powers works really well. In Ant-Man And The Wasp you have an interesting entertaining story, a couple of superheroes that are both worth watching, and some good special effects. I always preferred the Marvel to the DC Comic characters. The style is also better if you ask me. If you are into supehero comic movies I can't see a reason why you wouldn't like this movie. To me it's one of the better ones, even a tiny better than the first Ant-Man."
170,8,"Another solid MCU entry Ant-Man And The Wasp is a good, fun MCU flick. The wasp is another great addition to the MCU. Paul Rudd is funny as usual and so is Michael Pena. The villain in this movie, ghost is a very interesting villain. However the third act wasn't pretty meh. The mid credits scene is also very shocking as well. Overall, Ant-Man And The Wasp is another solid MCU entry."
171,10,"Perfect movie This movie had everything I wanted. The antagonist's arc is believable and satisfying, the supporting characters are hilarious, and the blend of humour and drama is ideal. Moreover, the visual effects are magical. They aren't just a glittery distraction, though. Antman's theme of resizing objects is used to great effect throughout the entire movie. What might have been a silly gimmick in less experienced hands is a vital component of the movie's action and narrative.This movie lacks revelatory philosophical insight. It doesn't push the boundaries of cinematography into avant-garde directions. It is, however, an incredibly satisfying film that accomplishes every goal it sets for itself. This is a textbook example of a comedy-action movie done right. I cannot find fault with this film."
172,6,"A Great Remake I'm not sure if it was my low expectations or not, but WOW! I liked this movie. It isn't flawless by any stretch of the imagination but it managed to do a couple of things really well that I had felt were failings of the first Ant-Man outing.For one, the humor in this movie works throughout. While I felt Paul Rudd was handcuffed in the first in AMATW they cut him lose to be the sort of funny character he is well capable of playing. Most films would probably make him super stupid and inept because that's how media treats dads in films. Her though, he is sarcastic, smart (but not the smartest), and not a bumbling oaf.Add to Paul Rudd, a real unleashing of Michael Pena's comedy chops and a couple of supporting comedy sidekicks for him, and the laughs just keep coming in AMATW.Another couple of things I didn't care for in the first Ant-Man was that the villain's main plot seemed recycled from ""Iron Man"" and the action sequences weren't that fun. Again, AMATW fixes those errors by involving more characters in the action scenes to make them more dynamic and a truly unique plot we haven't seen in a Marvel film before. In fact, trying to nail down who is the villain in this film is slightly more nebulous than one might think for a Marvel film."
173,8,"Puts the 'ant' in F'ant'astic In the aftermath of a failed mission in Germany with Captain America whilst assisting the Avengers, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) finds himself under house arrest and tries his best to bond with his daughter without leaving the house. However, when Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) learn that Pym's wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) can send messages to Lang as a result of his last visit to the quantum time vortex they recruit Lang to help locate Janet whom husband and daughter believe is still alive. But their rescue efforts are hampered slightly by a rogue group who want to steal their technology and a 'ghost' whom blames Pym for her life-changing characteristics...Peyton Reed is back in the director's chair for this sequel and once again 'fun' and 'entertainment' are the primary objectives here and boy does this film do a great job on both fronts. Yes it takes a bit of time to get going, but once it does it literally is a blast and the time really does fly by fast when watching this film. Both Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are note-perfect here and their chemistry and interplay is second to none.One thing I thought was funny was the subversive way the film seemed to mock modern technology and society; the idea of Lang's suit being temperamental and the technology repeatedly failing him and the scene where giant Ant-Man is skidding along a road trying to stop a truck whilst passing a group of people inside some kind of establishment who are so absorbed by their laptops that they fail to notice (whether it be work or social media) really highlights the blissfully unaware and self-absorbed society that we have become - it's like all these idiots you see day in and day out who are pratting around on their phones and walk out in front of cars or bang into things etc. I presume that this mockery was intentional, but either way I thought it was both saddening and hilarious.Reed is an excellent director and in many ways this is a brilliant film; the special effects are great and in many ways this film is bigger in scale than the first film and as with the first film Reed uses a lot of modern technology to enhance the viewing experience to his audience. Unfortunately where the film stumbles slightly (like with the first film) lies with narrative cohesion; the film is a little more busier than it needs to be and a lot of the characters are either superfluous, underdeveloped or just uninteresting; for example the group trying to steal the technology are not developed well and aside from Michael Pena Lang's other cohorts might as well have not been in the film at all (for all the purpose that they served). The girl who plays the 'Ghost' was a far more interesting villain whom at least had a decent backstory and it has to be said that she also gave a very strong performance.Despite a slightly problematic narrative and poorly developed villains, this film is so much fun that it really doesn't matter. I was laughing my head off a lot (particularly the scene where Ant-Man's flying ants were repeatedly eaten by seagulls which made a rescue mission much trickier than it needed to be). Of course, a cameo by the late Stan Lee is always welcome and was very funny in this film.In summary then, narratively it could have been a bit stronger and a bit more focussed, but in all honesty this really is nit-picking as you'll need to be missing a funny bone and have a general hatred of cinema to not find this immensely enjoyable."
174,9,Great Fun I really enjoyed the first Ant-Man and enjoyed this one even more. Very Funny and great acting. Iron Man used to be my favourite character in the Marvel films but quickly being taken over by Paul Rudd's Ant-Man. Thoroughly enjoyable 2 hours.

178,5,"Quantum Leap reboot... 334. Ant-Man and the Wasp. Well I had to watch it, just to understand where Scott Lang was during ya know... So this is pretty much filler. To explain how they do the whole sha bang in EndGame. But for me, I know what it really was: a reboot of the series Quantum Leap. Obviously what happened is Dr Sam Beckett leaped into Scott Lang, which was a pretty sweet upgrade from leaping into a janitor as explained by Always Sunny. So what is Dr Beckett's task in this leap? Well it seems that Scott Lang's girlfriends mom, Quantum Leaped herself right into Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, and needs to get out, also the Avengers need this device or Endgame just doesn't work, and its up to him to get her out and strive to put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home.

179,6,"Not as good as the original (or any phase 3 film) While Ant-Man & The Wasp is an ok film it just doesn't live up to the Original film. There are some okay things about it, Cassie Lang's role isn't big while her screen time is about the same. The story is good but just doesn't live up to its potential. Janet's powers are never explained. The comedy is mostly forced. The best part about this film is that is leaves a lot of possibilities for the Quantum realm in ant-man 3."
180,5,"Not sure on which level this plays to... but it's worth watching for the humour... I'm really trying to like this more than I did.You just can't deny that in the whole roster of films released by Marvel etc, this is a bit of fresh air. The leads are not heroic in the traditional sense of muscle-bound or geniuses etc, but are good fun with a great sense of humour. You go alone with this for the fun & gags.The story builds on the first story, and I enjoyed the first film but this time the story just lost steam for me towards the last third. We have a long lost mother lost in some sub-atomic world from long back, yet they now think they can get her back (don't worry if you're confused by what I have just written, much of what they say is confusing science-speak).Watch it for the laughs, the myriad of likeable characters and the break from the comic book norm.It's a fine enough film, but I just think they could have easily done so much better with the script, and then we would have so much more to write home about."
181,5,Terrible acting Michal douglas is a terrible actor. He ruined the fun of the movie. Don't understand how he even able to get this movie. However storyline and the plot is awesome but type cast was terrible.
182,8,Underrated I LOVE Paul Rudd in this role. He's perfect for it and the rest of the cast is also very good. It's a fun movie and more lighthearted than other Marvel films.
183,8,"Another fantastic outing for Ant-Man, with the Wasp along for the ride! Ant-Man and the Wasp was great fun. Even though it came right after Infinity War which had the most devastating ending, this movie comes along and cheers everyone up! This dominated the UK box office all summer and for good reason.Paul Rudd returns to the role as if he's never been away, Evangeline Lily returns as Hope Van Dyne and this time she gets to put on the Wasp suit, in this movie, she really kicks ass!This movie also sees a brand new villain in the form of Ghost who is one of the most sympathetic Marvel villains I've ever seen and Lawrence Fishburne is pretty fantastic as well. Even though they don't really turn out to be the real villains in the end and Ghost gets cured at the end of the movie thanks to the Quantum Realm particles.Speaking of which, I love Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne. It was quite weird casting to me as she's also played Catwoman as well but who am I to complain, she's such an amazing actress. Even though she barely appears in the movie, they made her addition worthwhile, with Marvel Studios showing off their de-aging effects on both her and Michael Douglas who as always is a magnificent Hank Pym.Michael Pena returns as Luis and he's as funny as he was in the first movie and the additional side characters really sell me, especially Cassie. Her chemistry with Scott Lang is really nice to watch. The chemistry between Ant-Man and the Wasp is really good too, this really makes the movie enjoyable, it's funny, charming, warm and witty. Possibly one of the best superhero combos ever.Overall, this is a fantastic movie and really fun to watch. It's a shame that people weren't really hyped for it just because Infinity War and Endgame. This really is a gem and it shouldn't be overshadowed as it's a really enjoyable ride, as a movie should be."
184,7,"Second go-around brings more to the table A refreshingly cheerful, energetic and light-hearted Marvel entry, Ant-Man and the Wasp buzzes along with the right comedic vibe. On another note, it's sequel gold; it's unchained by origin constraints, the villain is worthy and it's free to do it's own thing -- so long as you're down with goofball science and fantastical escapism. And here, it's hard not to be.For such a peripheral character, Scott Lang has seemingly come from behind and is one of my favorite MCU players. Rudd and Lilly make for a great team."
185,6,"Funny, but lacked a good story Loved the humor, and light side of the movie, but i felt like there was no real villain. Even the main problem of the movie was minimal and the villain and main characters basically wanted the same thing. His suit not really working during the whole movie was funny at the start but it just kinda made ant man feel like an even more weaker character than he already felt."
186,6,"Unoriginal and silly - but essential to the MCU One of the final entries of the Marvel Comic Universe's third phase, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp,' is a necessary film when viewed in the Marvel continuum. It doesn't pack a sting like 'Captain America: Civil War,' which is where things left off for Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and the crew. It's not flashy like 'Guardians of the Galaxy, nor does it have the flare of 'Thor.' But that's not the role of 'Ant-Man,' so it should be considered its own kind of superhero movie.Peyton Reed returns to direct the bite-sized good guy and his partner in crime, the Wasp (reprised by Evangeline Lilly), as they try to save the Van Dyne matriarch (Michelle Pfeiffer) along with Dr. Pym himself (Michael Douglas). The cast is once again the best aspect of 'Ant-Man,' as enjoyable performances from the likes of Michael Pena, Laurence Fishburne and of course, T.I., make for a fun ride. That said, it's hard to say this film is not a rehash of the previous one. Despite some interesting plot twists and the inclusion of another baddie (Hannah John-Kamen's Ava/Ghost), things more or less feel stale.There are some cool, creative scenes thrown in here and there (particularly a car chase in the streets of San Francisco), so it's not a complete disappointment. The humor is not totally off-brand, either. Sure, it feels a lot sillier than most Marvel properties, but it's true to Paul Rudd's image, and much of the film rides on his ability to pull off his role.So is 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' a future classic? Absolutely not. But it's essential viewing for any Marvel fan."
187,6,A solid Marvel Title This was a strange choice and place for the marvel time line story but in all was a fine film. The story seemed confused as to who their bad guy was. The lack of a real bad guy threat for the hero's to duke it out with hurt the film but wasn't a huge issue for me personally. Strange and different not unlike the original Ant-Man though some of the charm is lost as the more comedic approach becomes common for some MCU films.If you liked the first one you will probably enjoy this one.
188,6,"Light-Hearted Fun After the ending of Infinity War, I guess it may have been necessary to go back to the ""roots"" of Marvel, which is a movie about heroes kicking some ass with some good light hearted comedy. For the most part, Ant Man and the Wasp in a fun, entertaining movie, especially when it comes to the action set pieces that involve getting smaller or larger. I especially liked the car chase scene. The villains in this movie are fine, they're serviceable villains for an OK story. Paul Rudd is good and so is Evangeline Lilly. I think Michael Douglas is kind of phoning it in at this point, though and I thought the girl who plays Cassie wasn't particularly good. I found the editing slightly bizarre, like cutting scenes very quickly without letting the audience have like adequate time to savor each moment. The quantum stuff was good, although I would have liked to see more of that. I thought some of the writing, particularly concerning the humor was very hit or miss, at least for me. Some scenes, especially with the FBI agent who's in charge of Scott did work pretty well, though. Overall, though, this movie is exactly what you would expect. It's not like it's gonna break new ground or anything and it also shouldn't do that. It's a movie about the adventures of Ant Man and the Wasp. It's supposed to be a light-heated comedy/superhero movie. And in that sense, it gets the job done."
189,7,Movie Review By MsClashKing YT Ant man and the wasp took a lot of things from the first Ant man and made it better but the villain's are disappointing and the main story is a little weak. 7.5/10 B
190,6,"Great entertainment with a lesser plot I found this to be a decent follow-up to Ant-Man with this second installment, where we are nearing the end of Phase Three of the MCU.Paul Rudd is even better than in ""Ant-Man"", but the plot in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" suffers from less significance than the first rendition, which like most of the MCU films is about saving the world. Here, the plot is essentially about saving one person, and we don't have anything near believable villain(-s) in this film.Still, very entertaining with excellent use of MCU's signature CGI effects, albeit with a non-significant but humerous script."
191,7,"Ant - Man and the Wasp (GOOD) I gave this movie a 7/10 which for me is Good, and it is a good movie. I love the comedy in marvel movies and this has plenty of it. Paul Rudd is fantastic in this film and doesn't disappoint. The story is simple enough to follow and is interesting with all the quantum realm stuff which I believe will be a big part of endgame. I definitely recommend giving this film a go, I watched it with my wife who's not a super hero fan and she really enjoyed it."
192,7,"A Fun Sequel With A Great Cast In revisiting Ant-Man and The Wasp this week before Avengers: Endgame, I caught something I had missed. There were bits of dialogue that brought questions to my head, also I found a lot of things I really enjoyed about this sequel. This is going to be more of analyzing the film and maybe speaking about things that might come to pass in the future. I'll be spoiling the film a bit and doing less of my normal review. So, if you haven't seen Ant-Man and The Wasp yet, stop reading now, go check it out (because the film is fun) and then come back to read my thoughts. That was your warning, if you read on without seeing the film first that's your own fault.While I was upset that the first film put Evangeline Lilly on the sidelines for the action, this film rectifies it in spades. Every action is like the title, it's Ant-Man and The Wasp because like Cassie says near the end of the film maybe Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) just needs someone watching his back. Hope aka Wasp is a badass all her own. And I'm sure plenty of people would love to see her get her own film. Or at least Marvel can you give an A-Force all female Avengers film. I really love how Lilly embraces the superhero role and sores. She's more of the lead sometimes than Scott is. Speaking of Scott, Rudd is great as Lang, the hopeless but heart in the right place hero just trying to make sure his daughter is safe and has a father that is three for her. I know in the comics he's not portrayed as well. But MCU Scott Lang is one we can all get behind.Michael Douglas is great again as Hank Pym even getting to suit up in this. I was very happy about that. I'm an old school cat when it comes to comics and I want to see superhero Hank Pym not just scientist Hank Pym. Laurence Fishburne makes for a great foil Douglas' Pym as Bill Foster (aka Goliath). They feel like old friends who had a falling out working together, each with their side of the story. Every scene that features them two at odds is excellent. My one (of two) complaint about the film is a personal grip because being a huge fan of Michelle Pfeiffer is that she's not in the film enough. But I understand to the story she is the key, the ""item"" (I really hate to put it that way) that everyone is trying to attain. But when she shows up she damn near steals the show. Here's me crossing my fingers that she can play a much bigger role if there is another Ant-Man and The Wasp film.My second complaint would be Ava/Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). She gets the typical villain entry into a superhero film. Her family dies because of an experiment and she is imbued with super powers. The time with her isn't spent well. I don't feel her character earns the ending she gets. I don't even see a redemption arc in her story. She's a selfish character out for only one thing. And she will do almost anything (including harm to a child) to get it. Her character needed to be fleshed out more. It's also a bad analogy for people dealing with a debilitating illness and chronic pain. She's more henchmen than big bad. But it's played like she's always lurking because of her abilities and training.Walton Goggins is also kind of wasted as Sonny Burch a dealing of weapons and technology. He has one goal, will do what he has to get it. But he doesn't pose a real threat. At the end of the film, he and his men are dispatched fairly easily. I would think if they got such a good character actor as him they would let him really dive into the villain character. Outside of those qualms per the characters and writing, there are many elements of this film I enjoyed more than the first. I like the action sequences because we get more one on one combat. They also many more ingenious ways to use Pym Tech during action sequences. One of being the film chase at the end incorporating a giant Hello Kitty Pez dispenser and Scott Lang actually becoming Giant Man.I know this is a full-on comedy superhero film and some of the jokes land really well. But there are moments where joke after joke doesn't land as it should. Also, you can get taken out of a scene by a joke that was meant to hit but just falls flat. What is fun about the film is that it's a bit different from the normal MCU film. This is a rescue mission film where the main point is to track down and save Janet Van Dyne. Ghost and Burch happen to be ""villains"" in the way of that. There's not a huge villain to stop, just a character to hopefully save. I really like that. I'm kind of done with origin films from Marvel. Just intro the characters in on film and then make their solo film a story where they already have their powers. (Spider-Man: Homecoming does this so well) I wouldn't say I liked Ant-Man and The Wasp more than the first Ant-Man film but there are plenty of elements in this film that stand out for me more than the first film."
193,9,Hugely entertaining Great script. Funny. Fantastic special effects. A-list actors.
194,6,"Fun but a missed opportunity for Marvel. The first Ant Man had zero expectations on it and turned out to be a great heist movie built into a super hero film. Ant Man & the Wasp is another side jaunt into the wider Marvel Universe that doesn't add to the developing Infinity series. The big villain is Ghost, a tragic character who I felt more empathy for than Hank Pym. Her storyline as an exploited child for a Shield weapons program was more interesting than the overall rescuing Janet Pym and the search for the lab shenanigans that take up most of the storyline. Paul Rudd is likeable and funny as always, humanising a plot that is basically just about adding the word Quantum to everything as Rudd wryly points out. Evangeline Lilly is excellent as the Wasp and Walton Goggins makes for an effective side villain as Sonny. It's also fantastic to see Luis back and Michael Pena gets some great screen time. Along with the ever dependable Michael Douglas, Michelle Pffeifer, Laurence Fishburne and Randall Park, the cast doesn't miss a step and raises an average plot beyond what it deserves. Overall Ant Man and the Wasp is a fun addition to the Marvel Universe, but as Ghost could have made for a brilliant surprise Marvel film on her own, this feels like a missed opportunity."
195,6,"Disappointing but servicable I enjoyed the first movie quite a lot, even though it didn't do well at the box office. It was a fun heist movie which was a nice change of pace after Ultron was a bit of a letdown.I'm sad to say that this one was a bit of a letdown overall. It's not terrible, the plot just was a bit too much and didn't workThe gist of the plot is pretty much that Scott has been put under house arrest after the first movie and has pretty much parted ways with Hank and Hope. But when Hank finds a possible way to find his love who was long lost in the macro-verse, Scott again finds himself in the Ant-Man suit to help them.That start is promising, but soon they throw in the baddie, Ghost, who is a really weak and poorly written one at that. Her back story involves someone negatively effecting her life with stolen Pym tech and used it improperly. She is after the gang to try and use their tech to cure her ailment.Also on their tail is a gangster who wants to steal Pym's Ant-Man tech after Hope enters a deal gone wrong with him.It's got some really creative moments with the shrinking and growing aspect of the technology, but those moments unfortunately are stuck in a really uneven plot with too many characters chasing after the Pym team.Between Ghost, the gangster, and the crew trying to save Hank's wife, there is just WAY too much going on. It could have worked with maybe just Ghost, but she would have needed to be better established for it to work. I have NO idea how the gangster plot even made it past the original script process. It adds nothing and is just a waste of time.It's not a bad movie at all, it's entertaining and better than Guardians 2 or the early Thor movies. It's just a middling one that should have been as great or even an improvement on the first. It's a shame that Edgar Wright wasn't able to create his vision of Ant-Man despite the first movie being pretty good, it just sucks that the same creative team from the first made this mediocre movie."
196,7,"The 20th Film in the Franchise (to Pym; referring to the Wasp suit) Scott Lang: ""Hold on, you gave her wings?!"" Dr. Hank Pym: ""Wings and blasters."" Scott Lang: ""So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me."" Dr. Hank Pym: ""No, I did.""A lighter, brighter superhero movie powered by the effortless charisma of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, Ant-Man and The Wasp offers a much-needed MCU palate cleanser! Just what was ordered after the experience of Infinity War! Paul Rudd is doing amazing in developing his craft as Ant-Man and it shows, he was good in the debut but better in this."
197,10,"Funny, entertaining and good humored. A superhero movie like they don't do them anymore! A 10 for a superhero movie? Well, yes, as far as superhero movies go this is a 10. It's set in the real world for a start, no weird alternate universe, so the the supers are supers vs their environment, not just a complex fantasy character in a fantasy setting. And then it's funny, good humored and still full of good fx! A pleasure to watch."
198,3,"Sorry, could not finish viewing I had to bail at about fifty mins into the movie. Sadly the movie tries to do too many things at once - family, romance, action, comedy, scifi, human drama. And only god-like directors and actors can pull that off. I can think of maybe Arnold Swartzenegger as the only actor who could do all that in harmony. Absent such a force, they should have dropped family and romance like in the other Marvel movies and concentrated on the rest. If you must try, you need to get a more genius of a director."
199,6,The MCU (So Far) Ranked: 18 Meh.Ant-Man and the Wasp is actually pretty good. Paul Rudd is allowed to fully explore his comedic talent making this a very watchable film however the script lacks any focus and it is ultimately difficult to stay invested in anything happening on screen. It's a mixed bag but it's pretty fun.
200,7,"Standard marvel movie with a weak villain When you want a standard marvel comedy to watch after office hour this is your movie. Nothing to deep, fun comedy, funny character just fun time to forget everything. Unfortunately thats it. The villain could be better, the story is too flat, nothing mindblowing."
201,8,"more low-brow action hero coolness A sequel is rarely as good as the original, but this one manages to hold its own! The ""girl power"" factor isn't too heavily part of the movie as they're equals in their own way, the camera angles are once again quite dazzling and although there are a few more bells and whistles this time compared to the 1st Ant Man movie, it still doesn't get over-the-top. I enjoyed it!"
202,3,"Another Boring Sequal Boring. First one was funny. Sequal is not.Even special effects are mediocre.Been there, seen it...."
203,1,Boring I was excited to watch the 2nd ant man movie. Bored to death. Do not recommend
204,6,"Reasonable sequel There isn't much which expected from Ant man and the wasp due to its processor film Ant Man. These both films aren't meant to be taken completely serious and tone of this film is more of the same, and different in comparison to other Marvel films.Featuring many jokes and silly gags throughout, at some points it is over done but other times comes off as genuine. This film is decent for what it is yet at the same time may become somewhat forgettable. Another thing, is this film feels much more childish and aimed towards younger children than others."
205,6,"Movie Review: Ant-Man and the Wasp This is either a pretty cleaver comedy or a pretty dumb action film. Either way it's a perfectly serviceable marvel movie.The biggest positive for this film is just how perfectly cast Paul Rudd is as Scott Lang, his signature fast paced one liner sense of humour really comes through making this quite a bit funnier than the first instalment.Reed was also able to work more of his own vision and so it never feels like he was standing in Edgar Wright's shadow also an improvement on the original.A handful of creative uses of the shirking concept make for some really great action sequences but really some cool action and few decent jokes is all this movie has. It's not particularly memorable and won't be anyone's favourite MCU film but it's enjoyable.The villains are predictably weak and frankly bring the film to a halt anytime Rudd or Peña aren't sharing screen time with them but they don't effect the overall quality too much.I don't have a lot to say about this film, what can I say really? It's fun, it's creative, it's worth buying on blu-ray."
206,5,"Less Satisfying than a Cheap Fast Food Burger (Flash Review)An excuse to play with CGI shrink and grow effects. With a rather weak and thin core plot point, it is barely enough to be a foundation for the lightly entertaining super hero fluff action and effects. Effects that were as good as expected. There is an abundance of shrink and grow effects and light humor as Ant Man and The Wasp try to rescue The Wasp's mother who had been trapped at a sub atomic size for 20 years or so before there was a safe way to resize her. Mix in an obstacle of an under-developed enemy, which was thin on how she became who she is, with a molecular problem and there's your run-o-the-mill super hero movie. It was nothing more than fine."
207,8,Brilliant sequel and a fun Marvel movie Antman and The Wasp a great marvel film and a fun sequel to Antman that's adds more humour with a simple story and a bad ass villain in my opinion.I really enjoyed this movie its better than the first one in my opinion the action is brillaint the humour fantastic the villain is interesting. I love the addition of the Wasp she looks amazing and the action scenes with her alot of fun to watch.The highlight of the film is his Scott Lang Paul Rudd is amazing in this role he brings the humour to this role and his juts fantastic. I love his relationship with his daughter in the movie its such a touching relationship and very well handled.Very enjoyable movie with fantastic action and great humour and an end credit scene that is just shocking DAMM YOU THANOS.Verdict 8.5/10 great movie love Paul Rudd in this role and Antman is always fun to watch.
208,8,"Another great film in the MCU I loved this film just as much as the first Ant Man film. Lots of fun, lots of humour and lots of action. Hope is as hot as ever, Rudd is funny and his daughter is super cute too. Great jokes, great chemistry and great characters. Well worth a watch"
209,8,A nice time out Just what you need when you are leading a monotonous life...... Not something you would expect from MCU but it does the trick...
210,6,"Ironic lack of scale Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun movie with some neat tricks, but lacks the two essential elements of a super hero movie: a hero and a villain.Sure, Ant-Man is in the movie, but he spends the duration either running around in a broken shrink-suit, or racing to get home to obligate his house arrest. These are two repeating tropes of the movie that bog it down and just seem like lazy plot devices. It's actually the Wasp who sines in this movie, carrying out most of the action in style, as opposed to Ant-Man fumbling around with malfunctioning equipment.As for the villain, there's not much going on, it really seems like the producers tried to cram in a bunch of bargain-bin baddies instead of just having one exciting nemesis. At the end of the day, the villains of this movie are really just annoyances who got in the way of our hero's mission, rather than ever posing a threat to it.Finally, the representation of science in this franchise is both cliche and nonsensical. Okay, it's just a fantasy movie, but can it at least be internally consistent? Some things get heavier as they're made bigger, some things get lighter as they're made smaller, and yet what about Ant-Man? When shrunk, he's able to punch with the weight of a full size adult, and in the first movie he broke a floor tile but simply landing on it, yet he's somehow light enough to be carried around by a flying ant?Regardless of it's problems, the movie is still entertaining; it comes with plenty of laughs and doesn't take itself too seriously. I watched it through and, although the plot was just meaningless to me, the value was in the pacing and antics of the characters."
211,8,"gigANTic success. Great hero movie. No this is not an avengers movie, it's a fun heroic ramp through San Francisco and other dimensions"
212,2,Not a film critic 🙄 All I can say is I dosed off a few times. No drugs needed because this is a snooze feast 😪😪😴😴😴
213,5,Just go home Ant Man I loved the first Ant Man movie and was excited for the sequel but sadly it disappointed with a story that shows barely any Ant Man action sequences instead just Paul Rudd wearing the suit and not doing anything with it the Ghost Character is wasted in this movie with no real back story or depth to the character or even any good fight scenes the jokes are all size related which gets old fast all in all its a movie you will watch once and think of as a time filler for Endgame.
214,7,"Thank You Paul Rudd I usually hate superhero movies, but I liked this one. I didn't see the first one, or any of the other Marvel movies that the character of Ant-Man may have been in, so it took some time for me to figure out what was going on. But let's face it, these movies aren't exactly the equivalent of brain surgery, and plot is such an afterthought in most superhero movies anyway (which is one of the things I hate about them), that I didn't have to expend a lot of effort on catching up.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is funny, it's short, and it has the huge advantage of starring Paul Rudd, who single-handedly makes the film worth watching. No, I take that back. Michael Pena deserves a lot of credit for that as well.Grade: A-"
215,8,"Great This film's comedy was outstanding, the acting was brilliant, and the film overall was great. Peyton Reed does a great job adding his style, and the comedy and fun is just what we needed after the tragic events of Infinity War. Great cliffhanger in the mid credits scene setting up Endgame!"
216,4,"Another meh movie in a list of meh movies sadly It's one of THOSE movies where it's just fine until you think of it more. It was obviously going to be a meh movie to me, but I was hopeful though and I wanted this to be more than just a ""New Marvel Movie"". Alas, I was disappointed."
217,5,"Uninspiring with a juvenile tone This is posted after my second watching, but my rating stands. Here is my review after seeing it the day of its release: This will be a minority opinion (of the 8 reviews posted here on Trakt immediatley after the premiere I was the only one who feels this way - the other rating ranges from 7 to 10 out of 10) but as I left the theatre I felt the whole movie was flat and didn't quite hit the mark. The humour seemed more miss than hit. The people around me seemed similarily unamused. During the whole movie there were only two guffaws from audience members at different moments, one from a child during a silly bit and the other from an adult male as a cynical response to a piece of dialogue. I should reveal that I am not a big Paul Rudd fan and found the first ANT-MAN uninspiring as well. Evangeline Lily (who's work I really do enjoy)'s character was at the forefront of this movie but her strength in expressing a depth of emotion (especially internal conflict) was thwarted by a script that didn't allow any depth beyond stoic determination and there didn't seem to be any reason for her character to be drawn to Rudd's Scott Lang. I thought Michael Douglas role and performance was a disaster. Walton Goggins' villain lacked any convincing motivation. However, Hannah John-Kamen (always a good actor) gave us a convincing portrayal as Ava Starr/Ghost. It's always good to see Michelle Pfeiffer (even for the 15 minutes she is in this movie). CGI was great. Adventure was pivotal. Sight gags abounded (as the last post-credit scene attests). I can see this movie appealing to: 1) people who liked the first movie, 2) Junior High males, and/or 3) Marvel Universe purists (by the way, there is a mid-credit and a post credit scene). Although I will always watch each new addition to the Marvel Universe whether in TV or Movie format, I can only give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}"
218,8,"Fun for all sizes! I really, really...REALLY loved this part of the Marvel universe. Likable characters. Funny lines. Creative action. Love it!"
219,8,As good as the first! I enjoyed the first movie and this was just as fun. Wood watch it again.
220,9,"Great! Watching this movie was definitely a relief to watch, after things with infinity war this was definitely a break before the big punches started rolling in. It provides satisfaction to the overall views, it also leans towards the younger adult and children audience, which in my opinion is a good change. Sometimes we all have to have our fun and enjoy a movie with pettiness and laughter, I couldn't name a better evening but watching ant man and the wasp with a group or friends or family.Ant man and the wasp is fulfilled with never ending mystery. Ant man is struggling with the responsibility of being a dad and a superhero, he also has to suffer the burden of being outcast-ed by his team. His team has been working on a secret project, a true mystery waiting to be revealed but not to ant man, but to the memories inside their aching hearts. So many possibilities at the same time to be calculated becomes overwhelming and keeps you at the edge of your seat, waiting and waiting for all the miracles and secrets to be revealed in a gut retching backstory that still needs explaining.Within this movie there are so many little tedious jokes to be heard and snickered at that sometimes you wonder why you're laughing at this marvel movie. An example of one of my favorite kind of joking scenes is when ant man and the wasp were sitting in the van after getting out of the FBI building and they looked at each other like flirtingly and were like ""hey"" her dad like cleared his throat loudly and said ""can you stop admiring my daughter and drive please?"" Sometimes you have to ask yourself ""should I be crying or laughing?"" The movie has so many ways to keep you on track of what you're actually supposed to be paying attention to, rather than flirty dialog or humourous acting. At times in this movie you may feel the sweet feeling in your heart towards ant-man and his daughter but at other times you will be cry laughing and those pity jokes sometimes the kids won't get, or your cry laughing at th jokes that are for a 4 year old and then you start putting yourself into this disappointing state of, ""really? That's what made me laugh?"". So I mean it can go both ways you never know when watching this roller coaster of a movie and series.The ant-man series is very complex by adding certain subject to the story line like Quantum theory, or Quantum physics. During the movie there are scenes that fully explain Quantum theory- a theory of physics which describes the most smallest scales of energy levels such as atoms and subatomic particles. This movie has intertwined these bizarre concepts into a family friendly movie that is easily understood. I believe that it takes talent to find a quantum scientist to dumb down a theory that has been studied since the 1900's. Its very fascinating and interesting to think that these directors took a risk into putting millions into this movie and combining arduous topics into children and teen heads.This movie will remain one of my favorite marvel movies because of its humor and just petty adults jokes that slide in while the kids aren't looking. Once you really pay attention to this movie you start to realize that this movie can be in depth and has a lot of serious issues being presented. The director really did his job in not making it a dark DC movie, but really a child friendly movie that all ages can relate to and I respect that."
221,6,"Watch it only because Endgame I'm really not that into Ant-man, just watched this before Endgame. Villain is meh and plot is really predictable. It has some good jokes (Ant-onio Banderas) but other than that it is pretty mediocre."
222,6,"Too Much Story, Not Enough Space Ant-Man & the Wasp stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang in this second installment of the character's saga. Scott is three days away from the end of his house arrest, but unexpectedly involves himself in another adventure when Hope and Hank find a way to bring back Hope's mother who went missing in the quantum realm many years ago. Meanwhile, a villainess known as Ghost emerges to steal Hank's lab for her own purposes. Ant-Man & the Wasp offers some much needed sunshine to a rather grim chapter in the MCU. The smaller story and heavier focus on humor was refreshing to see after Infinity War. I appreciate the film's commitment to this tone and that it didn't try to be anything more. That being said, I can't say it works as a whole. Though the story is on a much smaller scale, the writers threw in way too much material to fit into one movie. By the film's resolution, it doesn't really feel like these stories concluded rather than stopped suddenly in their tracks. The movie is approximately two hours long and this simply was not enough time to devote to the amount of story shoved into it. As an audience member, I can't say I really cared what happened to the characters by the end aside from the main plot line involving Scott, Hank, and Hope. Though Ant-Man & the Wasp's size is refreshingly smaller, the amount of content crammed into that small space was simply too much."
223,3,More like a kids carton then a movie. This story was silly at best. It's a toss up between the effects and story as to why this was so bad.
224,8,"Better than the first I was impressed by this one. It was funny, entertaining, and had a pretty good story. It was a little predictable but still a good movie. It was family friendly which made it all the more better. I thought it would have had a lot more profanity like the first one but I was glad to see that they cut most of it out. I thought it compared in entertaining me to Thor Ragnarok. I thought it was Marvels best movie."
225,8,"Short review This movie had to be watched before captain marvel...so i did. And it was epic...the growing big and small, the science, everything. The direction and screenplay is top notch. The humour also adds to the fun. Overall a very good movie"
226,8,"Another good addition to the MCU Review for ""Ant Man and The Wasp"" (8/10)""Ant Man and The Wasp"" is another good addition to the MCU, and while it doesn't have as much style as James Gunn's Guardians movies or Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok, Peyton Reed has honed in on everything that made the first Ant-Man so charming and doubled down on it. ""Ant Man and The Wasp"" takes place 2 years after ""Civil War"", and either right before ""Infinity War"" or during. But that doesn't come into play at all (not until that mid credits scene). But that doesn't mean ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" is divorced from everything else that's happening in the MCU; while the sequel succeeds in telling a refreshingly self-contained story, it's clear that the discoveries revealed here will play an integral role in Avengers 4 and beyond. The key characteristic that ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" shares with the rest of the films in Marvel's Phase Three is a focus on family, whether that means your blood relatives or the tribe you form for yourself. The first Ant-Man is arguably the lightest of the MCU movies in both plot and tone, and the sequel has a similar playfulness. It wholeheartedly embraces the inherent ridiculousness of Scott's powers and the predicaments he often finds himself in -- mostly by staging some of the most inventive action scenes attempted in any movie franchise, not just Marvel's. Although it ventures further away from Marvel's traditional villain formula than any film before it, after the universal threat posed by Thanos in ""Infinity War"" it's actually a relief that ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" keeps its stakes personal, rather than galactic. Boasting some of the most creative action scenes and finely-calibrated comedy in the Marvel universe so far, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it certainly knows how to make the ride even more fun."
227,10,"Ant-Man and the Wasp, Teaming up Ant-Man and the Wasp, is funnier and cooler than the first film, in every Marvel step in the way. Ant-Man and the Wasp, team work. Awesome!! And the ending will shock you for a shocking twist.Ant-Man and the Wasp will return?"
228,5,"A movie that ties up loose ends and not much else. I'll be the first to defend Ant-Man (2015) from its detractors. Once I realized it was supposed to be a comedy (mostly due to Edgar Wright's early involvement), I knew the superhero aspect would take a back seat to the laughs. That being said, I cannot defend the honor of its sequel. Sure, a lot of the elements that made Ant-Man entertaining are still present in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), but it's really more of a standard superhero film that's meant to answer questions brought up in previous films.While this film picks up well after the events of this first film and Captain America: Civil War (2016), not a lot has changed. The main characters are all there, but now Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) also has a shrinking suit. This is no surprise, considering the after-credits scene from the first movie, so it was nice to see her get into the action rather quickly. Similarly, due to the events of Ant-Man, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) realizes his wife is still alive and sets out to find her and rescue her from the quantum realm. Essentially, this sequel is wrapping up all the loose ends present in the first film.Part of the problem of this movie being less of a comedy (even with Michal Pena's awesome ""narration bit"" again making an appearance), is that it needs to be viewed as a superhero film. Unfortunately, while the new ""villain"" has a neat power, she wasn't that compelling. Even the mafia-type villains were mostly there for so-so comic relief. In the end, Ant-Man and the Wasp tried to do too much with three different storylines all competing for screen time. Sure, there was an emphasis of balancing personal life with superhero life (a la Spider-man: Homecoming (2017)), but it all felt flat in comparison to what eventually needed to happen based on the events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018).A movie that ties up loose ends and not much else, I give Ant-Man and the Wasp 2.5 stars out of 5."
229,9,"Drew a deep laugh from me. A shallow person will not enjoy this movie. Don't compare it to any other, watch it to get away from your daily life. If you have no sense of humor, this movie is not for you. Acting was on par. Very enjoyable."
230,5,"Lack of opportunity and story I hate Ghost she suck I hate how she is not anonymous and her backstory is boring, 2nd I hate the scene when Hope's mother take controls of Scott is wierd, 3rd Goliath (sorry if I may spe his name wrong) is a misopportunity for him to be a giant hum argue with ghost is boring the only scene I like is luis but I hate the van scene luis and hope together is boring. Agent wu make me laugh but I wish he is a shield agent bu the whole arrest thing is wierd"
231,7,"Meh. I had high expectations that this film didn't quite meet. But it was enjoyable enough, just not up to par with what they usually produce. Maybe because it was a sequel?!"
232,4,"Forgettable, boring, and inconsequential Right off the bat, I like Marvel. Most of the movies this company has released are fun popcorn entertainment, some stand out as well-assembled, exceptional films(GoD, Iron Man). After the enourmous success of Infinity War, it would be extremely difficult to capture the viewer's attention on anything else, since Infinity War ended with a giant cliffhanger.Ant-Man and the Wasp tries to be on a much smaller scale, letting the audience take a breath from the colossal stakes and exciting action of Marvel's most successful movie to date. However, this simply does not work. You could not make me care less about these boring, bland, and one-dimensional characters that fail to provide any sort of entertainment. Michael Peña did stand out, though, for he was just as humorous as in the first one and once again is the best character of the two movies.The story is very forgettable, the villain could barely be defined as one, and the finale is confusing and lazy. The Marvel formula lasted as long as it could, but it is starting to lose its charms, these movies are mostly the same, they fail to provide compelling villains and basic and engaging stories. And while other Marvel movies boast interesting characters and exciting action, this one does neither of those things"
233,4,"Worst Marvel Movie This was by far the worst marvel film I've seen, although still better than every DC movie ever made. The only good part and reason for watching it was the post credit scene. The cool fights and action were shown in the trailer. Pretty disappointed."
234,6,"I expected this film to be just another entry to the MCU. So, what we have here is nothing really special. I mean, it's an okay story. I for one part enjoy the humour this movie provides. I really like Paul Rudd and Michael Peña, they add their own flavour to the scenes and the film overall. The rest of the cast does a pretty good job acting-wise. Nothing for me to complain about in that department. I loved the fact that they brought Janet Van Dyne, seeing as she is an important character in the comics. I wasn't impressed by the villains, although I enjoyed Walton Goggings' character performance.The best part of this film in my opinion, is the post-credits scene. That was one of the best in the entire MCU, at least considering what it represents, in terms of what lies ahead. The fact that the post-credits scene is the highlight says a lot about the quality of the motion picture itself. Nothing that came before can top it. But one has to consider that what came before this film was none other than Infinity War, so that sort of reduced what we could expect about Ant-Man and the Wasp.Overall, it has good comedic moments and some cool action scenes, but nothing more. But I was expecting that, so I wasn't disappointed or anything like that. I felt I was being realistic. Maybe some of you felt that way too."
235,6,"Filler movie. In all honesty, I love Marvel movies, but they are not as great as people talk about them, which is perfectly displayed here. This movie feels more like a filler episode in a Marvel TV Series. It is full with unlaughable jokes, an antagonist which is there, but you never hate her or love her, she is not important at all, you have another party of criminals which are put there so that they can be funny and comical in their decisions, but there is nothing special about them, cars and buildings changing shapes and proportions every 10 seconds, romantic relationship between the Ant-Man and the Wasp that never reaches it's peak, it is just there and so much more that this movie does, maybe not wrong, but way to ordinary.."
236,7,"A fun and nimble place-holder in the endlessley expanding MCU Given my unavoidable sense of superhero ennui, it's clear that best of the type are from the seemingly never-ending Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even so, the makers of the film that would follow Avengers: Infinity War, faced a difficult problem. We're accustomed to these films ending with scenes of city-wide destruction, but we're not accustomed to that destruction including swathes of the superheroes themselves. I wasn't as moved by this as many were - it seems to me pretty obvious that there's a get out coming that will mean they'll all be back in some way - but even so, how do you follow that?I've also grown tired of the aforementioned city-wide destruction; it's lost its tension, its shock and awe value for me. So the wise decision with Ant-Man and the Wasp, to go the same directions as the first Ant Man movie; take it downscale to the intimate and the small scale, in every sense of that. It works very well.I'd summarise the plot, but to be honest I can't really tell you what the plot is; that isn't as much of a criticism as it might be. The film is too busy moving at breakneck speed, being both fun and funny. The plot's incidental; the joy of this film is in the jokes and the set-pieces, where the comic potential of the microscopic fighting the normal size is well exploited. Two supporting turns deserve mention: Walter Goggins, who is never dull and Michael Peña is in fine form - most especially a brilliantly executed scene where he's subjected to a serum which forces him to tell the truth; this is the film's funniest moment. There's some engaging references to Morrissey and The Smiths; I think I may also have spotted some nods of the head to the 1966 Fantastic Voyage (where a crew are shrunk to miniature size and injected in to a live human body). Or maybe I just watched that film far too many times as a child.Anyway, like many superhero films it overstays its welcome - it could easily have lost 30 minutes of running time, and benefit from doing so. But in the ever-expanding MCU, this is a fun, nimble-footed place holder."
237,8,"ANT-MAN AND THE WASP MOVIE IN REVIEW Created by Disney's Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp is joyful sequel that definitely improves on the first, and provides a more lighthearted side of the universe after the latest Avengers: Infinity War movie. Following Marvel's timeline, this movie picks up two years after the events in Captain America: Civil War. Scott Lang, Ant-Man, is almost finished with his house arrest from his actions in the third Captain America. Scott has a dream about Hope's mom, Janet, who was lost in the Quantum Realm many years ago. Forcefully Scott has to help Hank Pym and Hope find a way to enter the Quantum Realm to rescue her. However, they are confronted by Ghost, a villain that can vanish and walk through anything. Together Scott and Hope, the Wasp, must stop Ghost and bring Janet home. There are many aspects that make this movie great, but some are the characters and cast, the social idea, and the credit scenes. Marvel does an amazing job at incorporating many characters while making them memorable and useful. Many times side characters are often forgotten or distract from the main plot of the film. Ant-Man and the Wasp features many side characters, with the most memorable being Luis, Hank, Jimmy Woo, Bill Foster, and Janet. Luis who is portrayed by Michael Peña, is known as Scott's best friend. Luis again shines in this sequel and in my opinion was best character in the film. Michael Peña is able to always give me a chuckle with every line he has, and creates a witty character with the best speeches. Hank Pym is a super genius and Hope's father. He created the Ant-Man suit and all the technology. He has a bigger role in the film over other side characters but he is able to create elder perspective on life for Scott. Jimmy Woo who is played by Randall Park is just an all-around fun character to watch. Jimmy has a great relationship with Scott as they set it up with a fun love-hate dynamic. Laurence Fishburne plays Bill Foster who is a long time colleague of Hank. However they had a falling out due to Hank's ego. Bill creates a great relationship with Ghost as a father figure. Lastly is Janet. She has a very small amount of screen time but is the main focus of this film. Her character creates a presence throughout the whole film and is memorable only showing up nearing the end. These are most of the side characters in the film, there are more, but Marvel is able to introduce them and make each movie goer remember each one. There is an overarching theme and issue in this sequel and the first. There is strong sense of family with more specific theme towards the relationship between a father and his daughter. This idea is reflected through Scott and his daughter, Hank and Hope, and Bill and Ava. Scott is able to continue his life get through many challenges because of his daughter, Cassie. She is the reason he lives and does what he does. ""You can do it. You can do anything. You are the world's greatest grandma."" Cassie reminds Scott of how much she means to him and love she has. Hank and Hope have built a strong relationship over the years, and always trust each other. However, Hope counteracts this idea because she is trying to reconnect with her mother. Lastly Bill has unique relationship with Ava. She is not his real daughter but you can see the two trust each and treat one another that way. Near the end of the film, Bill this shows his care and appreciation for her, as they must escape from the police. This social idea is represented heavily throughout this film and brings good attention for many families. As this is a Marvel production everyone knows about the credit scenes awaiting at the end of each movie. If you watched this film you most likely already watched Avengers: Infinity War, and you would know Ant-Man was missing from that movie. Marvel created a connected universe between all its' movies so the mystery of missing Ant-Man was solved. In the mid-credit scene we see a smaller portal to the quantum realm and Scott enters. However he is trapped because Hope, Hank, and Janet all ""fade"" into dust. It is now confirmed from the recent Avengers: Endgame trailer that Ant-Man will be in it so he must figure out a way to escape. The end-credit scene is more comedic but has hidden messages. We are shown a rather empty San Francisco, and we can infer the effects of Thanos have happened. The camera pans onto the oblivious giant ant playing on Lang's drums which he did throughout the movie. These scenes always add the movie and the most important thing for the next Marvel movie. Marvel has created a way for fans to always be interested and hungry for a new film. All in all Ant-Man and the Wasp is fun family film to watch. It is an overall interesting movie, with a more comedic point of view that other superhero movies. I would give it a 8 out 10. It missed the perfect ten due to minor issues that common viewer would often miss and allow them to enjoy it."
238,9,"Another Marvel Success Three years after the release of Ant-Man, Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Motions Pictures released the sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp. The movie opens with a flashback from the prior movie, Ant-Man, that sets the essential plot for Ant-Man and the Wasp. Scott Lang, portrayed by Paul Rudd, is on house arrest after his violation of the Sokovia Accords from Captain America: Civil War. Upon house arrest, Lang is frequently visited by FBI agents and gets kidnapped by his former partner Hope Pym, played by Evangeline Lilly, to gather intellect on the quantum realm where she and her father, Hank Pym, played by Michael Douglas, intend on manipulating to find Wasp, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer. The gang encounter new antagonists featuring old friends and new ones. Together, Scott, Hope, and Hank go to extreme lengths to rescue Wasp from the quantum realm while simultaneously avoiding the FBI. Ant-Man and the Wasp fulfilled expectations with its cinematography, connection to the Marvel Universe, and supreme acting. Marvel Studios' cinematography is nothing like ever seen before. Specifically to Ant-Man and the Wasp, the scene would constantly switch from the minute scenery, to regular, then to a ginormous scenery. I was very impressed with the minute setting of the movie. The cinematography dramatized the action scenes in the movie. From ants turning into human sized forms and humans turning to ant sized forms, the scenes of the movies are continuously changing to keep the audience sitting on the edge of their seat. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the camera work is able to emphasize the super hero moves of Ant-Man. When he turns small, the camera works to dramatize the miniature setting such as the falling of debris that looks like meteors falling from the sky. On the other hand, when Ant-Man turns big, the camera works by zooming out to capture his entire form, meanwhile making everything else from people to buildings look small. Overall, the cinematography was amazing especially with the way the director is able to manipulate the degree of action in the movie and the reaction of the audience. The Marvel Universe is quite impressive. If you're an avid Marvel fan or simply a frequent watcher of the movies, Ant-Man and the Wasp takes a step to connect the series with other movies from the Marvel Universe including Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. The connecting ties between Ant-Man and the Wasp and other Marvel movies creates a unity between the series and excitement for moviegoers. Despite not having watched the prequel to Ant-Man and the Wasp, Ant-Man, I was still able to enjoy the movie. As a semi-frequent Marvel movie watcher, I have watched Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. The beginning of the movie was a quick recap of Ant-Man which quickly explained the cliffhanger of the last movie that bleeds into the primary goal and plot of Ant-Man and the Wasp. Although missing out on the prequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp was tactically written for anyone to be able to watch and enjoy the movie. The opening scene cuts with Scott Lang in house arrest due to violating the Sokovia Accords. From watching Captain America: Civil War, it felt like two worlds colliding into one and suddenly the Marvel Universe started to make more sense. Avengers: Infinity War was released prior to the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp. In Avengers: Infinity War, the fate of humanity had ended as half the population turned to dust and disappeared. Correlating to Ant-Man and the Wasp, the fate of the heroes are shown in the must see post credit scene. Marvel's marketing strategy is marvelous. The studio strategically releases Captain America: Civil War ahead of time which sets a background to Ant-Man and the Wasp. Meanwhile, Avengers: Infinity War was released prior to Ant-Man and the Wasp, however the storyline of both movies occurred at the same time. Therefore, by the end of Ant-Man and the Wasp, Marvel fans were reassured of the fate of Ant-Man. What makes Marvel movies so popular amongst kids, teens, and adults is simply the way it is written and portrayed. Despite the seriousness behind the plot and the action packed scenes, Marvel writers consistently incorporates all types of humor into the movies. From Tony Stark's egotistical humor to Scott Lang's awkward and childish humor, Marvel Studios never fails to appeal to all ages. In Ant-Man and the Wasp, the acting was what enticed me the most. Paul Rudd's portrayal of Scott Lang's awkward humor clashes with Evangeline Lilly's portrayal of Hope Pym's strict attitude to create an oxymoronic atmosphere. The opposite personalities create a humorous setting. In addition, Lang's childish demeanor fits like perfect puzzle pieces with his best friend Luis' personality which is also light hearted and childlike. The scenes constantly move from serious and tense to comical. Every actor perfectly portrayed and became their character to create a movie that integrates various types of moods to fit the scene best for the storyline and the audience. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a great movie filled with action, drama, and humor. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages who enjoy action and humor packed into one film, especially to avid Marvel fans. Having watched many Marvel movies, I have always loved the cinematography and acting to which Ant-Man and the Wasp without doubt adds on to the list of Marvel movies that never fail to surprise me. Ant-Man and the Wasp definitely proved to be a prequel that was as good as the first."
239,7,"A Sequel as Good as the Original Having run afoul of the law in his latest adventure as Ant-Man, ""Scott Lang"" (Paul Rudd) has been confined to house arrest and in order to prevent an even longer sentence from being imposed upon him must stay there while being electronically monitored at all times. However, when his previous mentor ""Dr. Hank Pym"" (Michael Douglas) requests his assistance to help rescue his wife ""Janet Van Dyne"" (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the quantum realm, Scott feels obligated to help. Also involved in the rescue operation is Dr. Pym's daughter ""Hope Van Dyne"" (Evangeline Lilly) who just happens to be a super-hero known as the Wasp. But as difficult as this assignment what none of them realize is that there are two other groups with different agendas who plan on stopping them-and both have various resources at their disposal to accomplish their goals. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an enjoyable ""Super-hero movie"" which had decent amounts of humor and good special effects to compliment the action. I especially liked the character ""Luis"" (Michael Pena) who was absolutely hilarious. Be that as it may, while in most cases the sequel to a movie is generally not as good as the original, this one is an exception to the rule and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
240,5,"Just skip it. Just skip it guys. Nothing good in this movie. Below avanger as an MCU film. Just watch the end credits or movies explained in 5mins videos, it'll save your time."
241,6,"Very ordinary movies Very ordinary movies, from performances to special effects, from the hostess to the plot, can not pick out the same outstanding."
242,7,"Better than Discovery Channel? One of the clumsiest superheroes of Marvel get his second film after an incredible appearance in the ""Civil War""; this actually sounds like a Coca Cola Christmas truck and signals tons of fun.The background is pretty similar and Paul Rudd has to escape both the police and criminals, however, the means that are use make you hands come together with a clapping sound like ones of a little child that saw a magic trick. Not only we see old gadgets in the situations we wanted them to be used a while age, but we are introduced to some fancy new outfits and gizmos that are exactly the thing why the minification technology should be created. The connection with the global universe as always is in a form of a slight breeze reminding of something bigger but at some point it gives you a shudder you cannot easily forget.It is not an Ant-man movie without the tear-causing jokes that can instantly turn into a cringe festival. The story expands embracing several plot lines that actually intertwine in a nice way but are not sophisticated enough to cause a stroke of education. The main sore point is an unexpected one: in such a good consistency Marvel has been defeating DC in the tones of movies, screenplays and effects that the annoying villain was like a wasp sting in the neck: painful, inconvenient and totally unnecessary. Both Hannah John-Kamen and Walton Goggins performed softly speaking poorly, but HJK still has that irritation plume from ""Ready Player One"" that gives me the urge to scratch my eyes out.Catching my thoughts I would say that the sequel gave me a bunch if giggles and cause more excitement then a Discovery program about insects, for which I can say tapping the shoulder with a movie reel: "" Stand up, Peyton Reed, the knight of Marvel table, you did a good job""."
243,8,"The only negative is, it's not the avengers Great sequel, insanely funny and action jammed you'll have good fun with this one, Michael penã Is amazing and steps it up In the follow up"
244,7,"Nice side step in the universe After Infinity I was kinda glum about the Marvel universe. Don't get me wrong it's an amazing movie and I won't put any spoilers here of that movie, but if you've seen it you know what I mean.And Ant-Man and the Wasp was the perfect side step in the same universe but that reminded me things can be fun too!Always a pleasure to watch Paul Rudd do his thing, and it's a real nice film all together.Nothing spectacular but a good movie to watch to put you in a good mood."
245,3,"Ant-man and the horrible plot! The first one was good. Even with its plot holes and whatnot. But this movie's whole presence is absurd and forced. And just bad. Fun...yes Worth watching..hell no. Adds nothing to mcu, just a really bad movie riding on Paul Rudds acting. Absolute garbage."
246,6,"A Clock-Watcher with a Great Finale A bit of a lack-luster ""filler episode"" of a movie, the film's weak first and second act are almost over-shadowed by an inventive and exciting finale though it falls just short of erasing their memory. Its final act is filled with the ingenuity and fast-paced action set pieces that you'd expect from the best of the MCU series, while the rest is plagued by the forced humour, dull villains, missed opportunities and bloated character rosters you'd find in lesser installments."
247,6,"Four Movies for the Price of One The Matrix, The Time Tunnel, What Dreams May Come, and Star Trek Generations all made an appearance in this derivative film. Marvel must have run out of ideas. Hardly any chemistry exists between the characters except for Scott and his daughter. Even Mr. and Mrs. Pyms' long-awaited reunion seemed forced. While Ghost is not really a villain in the traditional sense, her desperation to live at the expense of others was selfish, not sensible, just like Dr. Soran in STG. Everyone else had someone to live for or save. Seeing that she only needed to wait ten minutes to be saved as well, and was promised as much, her decision to kill the Pyms doesn't seem to serve any purpose, as her character lacks depth. It would have been more noble for her to have sacrificed herself. Once saved, she barely showed gratitude, perhaps out of guilt that the person she was so willing to kill was her salvation.While we were in the reminiscing phase of the film, I would have liked to have seen a flashback to Black Goliath rather than just hearing his name. Those comics, along with Black Panther and Luke Cage - Power Man, were important to us young Black children. This film may have been my only chance to see him on the big screen. I feel deprived.Finally, I'm disappointed that this is not the Ant-man/Wasp I know. Hank Pym is a very complicated character who presented adult-level themes in the 60s about mental health and the responsibility of power. Now we have two characters, Spiderman being the other, begging to be in the Avengers when Pym was an original member. Pym deserves better than a comic-relief role."
248,8,"Another fun ride with charismatic actors The multiverse is not at stake. The future is not at stake. This movie is just about protecting and reuniting one's family. Toss in quantum physics that will undoubtedly play an important role in ""Avengers: Endgame,"" and the adventure unfolds.The effortless charisma and chemistry of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michael Pena carries the film. These characters are so engaging that the world doesn't need to be at stake to create a compelling movie. Lilly's Hope Van Dyne more than earns her title billing, as she suits up and proves to be the superior hero of the duo. While numerous bloggers try to wring feminist importance of every frame of the ""Captain Marvel"" trailer, few have taken note of Hope. Maybe if the third film is called ""The Wasp & Ant-Man,"" they will finally catch on."
249,7,"When my campers told me this was good, they weren't kidding I really liked this one! This movie came out while I was away as a counselor at overnight camp, so I couldn't see it until late August. That was torture. When I finally got to see it, my expectations were met, then exceeded.Compared to the previous one, it less focused on a specific genre of theme. It wasn't a heist movie like the previous, and wasn't really a full-blown superhero movie. This made it feel like one of the weaker entries in the MCU.Paul Rudd was funny in this. I did laugh quite a bit, and don't remember anything falling flat or being downright offensive, so that's a good sign.The new characters were nice. Wasp was very cool, I like her a lot. She is a great contrast to Ant-man, being the straight man to his comedy. Still, I can't help but feel that their romance is......off. It doesn't feel right. There's not much chemistry between them: the two act only as partners, and we're really only told that they're together, instead of shown. If the romance was built up over the course of both movies, that would be much better.Ghost is very interesting, since she is a villain who anybody could sympathise with, despite her actions. I also really love the ghosting(ha) effect whenever she moves. You see frames of her actions slightly before and after she does them, giving a unique effect that I now realize is a bit hard to describe. On top of that, Ghost is another great female character, proving to us that women can be just as cool, powerful, and interesting as men.If I had to complain about this movie, it would be the ending. Yes, opening up the Quantum Realm for future movies is great. But I honestly did not expect them to get Hope's mother back. The MCU has shown us recently that it's not afraid to defy expectations and give us the 'Bad Ending', whether we like it or not. This felt like a forced happy ending. As well, there were quite a lot of subplots and running jokes that just didn't work. As much as I love Luis, he really didn't need to be in this movie. Same with Hank's old coworker, who later is revealed to be working with Ghost. Nice twist, but it wasn't really integral to the plot.Overall, a nice movie with great action, good jokes, and a memorable villain who I'd honestly like to see more from. Ant-man is very much the forgotten middle child of the MCU family. He's a good kid: hasn't had any legendary mess-ups like Thor, or amazing successes like Captain America, which means he lies in the middle and isn't know for anything. Maybe, in the future, we'll get an Ant-man 3. That's going to be spectacular. Well, that is, if he survives Endgame...."
250,10,"a great entry in the MCU If you like movies with comedy and action all rolled into one, then this movie is for you!!! Set after the events of Captain America Civil War and ending during the events of Infinity War, Ant Man and the Wasp features the cinematic debut of Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp, Hank Pym's wife and mentor who must fight an enemy known as Ghost. Michael Douglas plays hank's dad with good results, and Michelle Pfeiffer stars in her first comic book movie since Catwoman in Batman Returns as his wife. The visual effects are amazing the soundtrack awesome and the action nonstop. Make sure to stay until the end for a bonus scene!!!"
251,3,"Boring and Awkward This movie is extremely boring, and highly annoying. We're presented with such a great cast but for some reason 80% if the dialogue is ""loveably whimpered"" by Paul Rudd, who doing the same lame schtick as in every single Rudd Movie EVER MADE!The biggest offender however, is the other 12% occupied by the extremely annoying and not funny Michael Pena, who made me turn off the movie after rolling up to ""help"" with whatever the hell they were doing at the end. Thats right, I couldn't have cared less what happened at the end of the movie because the movie doesn't really make me care. Frankly I was on the ""villian's side"".We get nothing from TI, Walton Goggins, or any other side character.Avengers: Endgame better not center around the dudes who's powers were too lame to be fighting Thanos at the end (ie- Hawkeye, Ant Man, Black Widow, War Machine, and Captain America).Without Strange, The Guardians, Thor, Ironman and Spiderman, snoozefest."
252,7,"Worlds Greatest Grandma I have mentioned before that I expected the first Ant-Man to be a misstep in the then growing MCU. So, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it, and how well they kept the story away from the general MCU with an exception or two. So, although I didn't make my way to the theater for this one, I was kind of excited for it, when it hit the streaming services here. For the most part, it does a good job, and I can say it's a fun sequel that may be a bit less then it's original.The cast is back, the characters are back, the things that made the first one good is back. The issues I have with this movie are more about villain and story. The first Ant-Man had a clear villain. He was evil, exploded sheep and would twirl a mustache if he had one. The Ghost was a bit more...meh. She had a tragic backstory that has been used a lot, and everything about her seemed a bit jumbled. This, in turn, leads the movie to bounce around a bit too much. Also, after the first tangle with them, the random weapon seller guys needed to go. They felt unimportant and added zero threat to the characters. It just felt like there were too many stories going on because of them. I mean it all ties together at the end, but I wouldn't day nicely. Still, everything I wanted to see in the movie was there, and it was nice to focus on Hope, and Hank for a large part, even though they are kind of a bit grumpy for my liking.Overall, complaints aside, the movie is a fun film that doesn't overstay its welcome. I again liked how they barely linked into the MCU which doesn't fit the Ant-Man part all that well. Time to wait for Captain Marvel..."
253,10,"Don't listen to the haters This movie is probably 100 times better than the truly god awful Black Panther, that is one most overrated and massively overhyped movie I have ever seen! Watch Antwan and the Wasp without thinking about it, you'll love it!"
254,4,"@50min and I'm trying to stay awake. Highly doubt this will be any better after this point in the movie. The plot up to this point is no surprise, the lines are cheesy, and the acting is nauseating."
255,9,"A Super Fun Pallette Cleanser after Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fantastic movie with a very well written plot and a terrific cast that shine in comedic and dramatic moments. It is great to see Scott Lang back as the lead character again and his rapid fire, witty dialogue is as good as ever. There are plenty of hilarious moments throughout, but never manages to take away from what is going on or make us care less about these characters.My only real complaint is that the film is trying to do a bit too much at once that it can feel a tad overstuffed at times. It was very ambitious and had a ton of interesting ideas that I was very invested in, but could not help but feel they could have preserved some for later movies.The cast is all as great as ever, Paul Rudd absolutely shines, Evangeline Lilly has an amazing presence and it is great to see her in an even bigger role this time around, Michael Douglas is very effective as always, Michael Peña is a scene stealer in the best way possible, and the overall cast is just a delight all around.The fun and adventure we need after the soul crushing Infinty War. A breath of fresh air from start to finish, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a great watch that I would recommend to all Marvel fans.Scott Lang is sent on an urgent mission that soon leads to the unveilment of huge secrets.Best Performance: Paul Rudd"
256,10,Fun movie to watch! I was so sad when I missed this movie on the big screen. Ant Man and the Wasp are two of my favorite superheroes. Amazing cast! There are a lot of funny and suspenseful scenes. I recommend it highly! I can't wait for another Ant Man/Wasp movies!
257,2,Better Bring The Fly Swatter Weak story and lacking in entertainment value.I have a hard time understanding what Marvel fans see in this movie. I badly wanted to see Ant-Man eaten so this underwhelming movie could end peacefully. My favorite part is seeing a three-story Ant-Man walk around the pier and not one single person notices the enormity of the situation.Two Hours You Will Never Get Back.
258,5,"The most average movie of all time There's absolutely nothing special about this film.The action is what you except. There are some lines that are funny, some lines that aren't. There are two villains that are halfway developed, but two half villains do not add up to one whole villain.You won't even remember you watched it the next day."
259,5,"Juvenile entry into the MCU franchise Having returned from the quantum realm, Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is channeling Janet van Dyne (the original Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer) who was lost in the sub-atomic limbo decades earlier. Hank Pym (the original Antman, Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope van Dyne (the new Wasp, Evangeline Lilly) want to use the info embedded in Lang's brain to bring her out. Complicating matters are gangsters and a quantum-shifting 'Ghost', all of whom are out to steal Pym's technology (conveniently stored in a portable lab). The plot is loosely thrown together and doesn't really make much sense (but involves many BDMs, flashing lights, and techno-babble), and the film is played mostly for laughs, mostly. Humour is a very individual thing but unlike 'Guardians of the Galaxy' or 'Thor: Ragnarok', I found the constant 'comic banter' in this film banal, forced, and not particularly funny, which may be due to the lack of talking racoons, overly literal 'Destroyers', or po-faced deities. None of the characters in 'Antman and the Wasp' are particularly novel, interesting, or engaging and I found their interplay to be flat, repetitious and predictable. Like Bugs Bunny or Popeye cartoons, the physics in the MCU requires a great deal of suspension of disbelief, but the Antman franchise really pushes the boundaries, especially as the 'rules' seem to vary with storyline requirements (e.g. the effect of size change on the mass of the object). Lack of internal consistency is, to me, usually a sign of lazy or sloppy writing in fantasy or science fiction stories. Disney, not Thanos, is the ultimate power in the MCU and this film seems to be made for the studio's youthful target audiences: with lots of cloying daddy: daughter bonding, puerile barf jokes, goofy side-kicks, and silly sight gags. Being decades outside the Mouse's crosshairs, the movie wasn't aimed at me, which may be why I found it neither interesting nor entertaining."
260,1,"Writers no longer know how to write a good story I collected comic books for over twenty years. I was a huge Marvel fan (I liked DC too, but Marvel was my favorite).There are very few adaptations from comic to big screen which I liked; even less are the movies which attempt to squeeze too much in to one movie. The reason why I dislike it is because my imagination is better than any CGI or other special effect which is used today to bring the supers to life.My imagination was used more when reading comics because you sort of had to fill in the empty spaces. Comics usually had 20-30 pages of scenes and as a reader you would get bits and pieces of the story. The filler was the imagination while the art work gave you the key components of it.Ant-Man and The Wasp are OK heroes, but only in comic form. This movie is filled with too much filler. There is too much gunk stopping the story from being interesting. My imagination is blocked from working because the writers have created the filler and it isn't good.The bad guys (bad girl) in this movie are really weak characters. They lack any interesting background and they also are boring. They don't have any purpose. It would have been more interesting to watch killer ants attack the human population and then the heroes would have to stop them. Instead we are left with a really illogical back story from a character who isn't really a villain anyway.I'm glad I didn't watch this in the theater. I would have felt like I blew $12 on a movie which isn't worth $1. The writers need to go back to school and the director too. They obviously have no skills in creating a great super hero movie."
261,10,"Family Night Must See... It does not matter what age, This is a great movie for a fun family night in. Age appropriate for all, so grab the popcorn, blankets, and SHUT OFF ALL DEVICES. 💡#DeviceFREE #Family Night... 💜 @Luckeedesigns"
262,9,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile! Great dialogue, great scenes and visual comedy and action as well...but wow, some funny lines in this. The last scene between the FBI agent and Scott will go down as a classic...had to watch it 3 times...LMAO, indeed. And the whole movie is full of great lines, but it beautifully manages to not be cheesy at all. The MCU is really honing the art of walking that line between incredible action and story, and fantastic humor without being ""camp""...and I think that is a real art!"
263,7,"Fell short of my expectations I can see this movie is good, certain sequences felt a bit underwhelming tho But boy it was fun"
264,8,"A mostly comical, entertaining super-hero movie straining to be funny It is a personal preference, but I seem to prefer D.B. Sweeney in the role of Ant-Man instead of Paul Rudd. Nevertheless, this mostly comical super-hero movie is entertaining, but perhaps as the script goes it the strain and effort of making it funny seems to show through. And the emotional drama and serious tones seem to be somewhat overly unbalanced. The special effects are cute for a while, but at times seems to wear thin. Unlike Interstellar (2014), the visual design just isn't ready to display the quantum realm in any acceptable, real way. The audience has already experienced Honey, I've Shrunk the Kids (1989) and there have been some very amazing off-beat movies that have really struck a cord in their stellar visual creativity as Tomorrowland (2015), Ghost Busters (1984), Fantastic Voyage (1966), Spiderman 2 (2004), Colossal (2017), What Dreams May Come (1998), Brainstorm (1983), Being John Malkovich (2000), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Congress (2013), Birdman (2014). Overall, the movie was fun and mostly comically funny and delightfully summer super hero action."
265,6,Just okay.... A lot of the film landed flatly for me. Was hoping for more with this one. The visual effects were really done well though.
266,8,"Easy to watch Great movie, easy to watch. No need to think about it to much, love it for a Friday night after a long week on the couch with some snacks.Just relax, enjoy en eat some snacks people."
267,6,"Easy to watch with its pleasing visuals and humor, but ultimately superficial and juggling too many plot lines Ant-Man and the Wasp is a lot like Thor Ragnarok, and honestly I think I liked it a bit more. The humor landed well with me, especially with Pena and Rudd. I really like the visuals - the action sequences seamlessly transition with them shrinking and enlarging, and those transitions are what make the action scenes successful. I did think the movie leaned a little heavily on the action, and inconsistencies in the action sequences abound as always (they are very willing to shrink themselves and the car and risk getting crushed, and the power/mass they have as their size varies doesn't seem consistent at all). Some of the emotional notes land - the relationship between Scott and his daughter is genuinely touching, and the Pym family drama is good. I didn't think Scott and Hope's relationship arc made sense - Hope was extremely upset at Scott when they meet and doesn't want to talk to him, but without any substantive discussion or resolution she's suddenly referencing how they had sex and flirting about how they had success as partners in the past? The script also didn't feel fully coherent because there were so many plotlines that seemed to pop up randomly. In particular, what did the black market guys add to the movie aside from confusion (and parts at the beginning)? I kept hoping for more development with Ghost, but didn't think the acting was great and just didn't amount to much. The ending with Ghost also could not have made less sense - Van Dyke comes back from the quantum realm and just by touching her face saves her? Just bizarre. The writing of the police chief and his interactions with Scott did feel silly and like forced humor. In general, I didn't think the ending gave emotional payoff to the long build that came before it. As often happens, all of the various groups of bad guys are foiled or tamed easily, and everything just comes together cleanly. It's very fun and a movie that can be widely enjoyed, but not a substantive or strong movie as you consider it deeply."
268,3,"Boring bottom feces I really hoped it would be a good movie, but unfortunately the plot is so YAAAWN.It's almost like Marvel thought 'Hmmm, actually we should cover content for every target group, so let's make the Ant-Man series for families, so parents can watch it with their kids.' And that's exactly what this movie feels like. Plot no depth, humor for kids.It tells A LOT if the post credit scene is the best part of the movie. If you are 'a fan' or just watch all of the MCU movies, 'Ant-Man And The Wasp' is probably the most skippable one. You are fine if you ONLY watch the post credit scene if you plan to watch future movies in the timeline and don't want to miss the gist of this one."
269,9,"The Best Marvel Movie of 2018 I really enjoyed Ant man 2 I thought it was a very entertaining movie and miles better than black panther and Infinity war. I know that this is unpopular opinion but I have to be honest about it. Black Panther and Infinity War were too slow and too boring for me. Ant Man 2 on the other hand was a much faster paced movie and in my opinion did have more action. The acting was good the directing was good and so was the writing. I don't see much wrong with the movie, I liked pretty much everything about it.The humour was good and it was funny just like the first movie. I personally feel that ant man is an underrated character. I thought the guy kicked ass in this movie. This movie is a good example of how a character can still be funny and kick ass at the same time. Being funny does not make you any less of a badass in my opinion. Paul Rudd plays the part very well and he is an actor that has grown on me because of these two movies. I definitely like him more now than I used too.The movie does have a couple of slow spots but despite that, its still a great movie. All The main characters were likeable and funny too, Even Michael was likeable despite his moody behaviour. I didn't really like him when he was moody i have to be honest, however Even though he was moody i still got a couple of laughs out of him too. Also i thought his moody behaviour made sense after what happened to his wife in the past. The movie also has good action scenes, my favourite would probably be the chase scenes those were fun and adrenaline pumping. I liked the fight scenes too they were ok. I also liked the emotional parts of the movie. I thought the movie did a good job of making you feel sorry for certain characters. This movie definitely made me feel something and made me care about what was going on unlike the previous two movies did. (Black Panther and Infinity War). Black panther tried to be emotional but it failed in my opinion. It came across as too fake, and also its very hard for me to care about a psycho villain who wants to commit genocide. Why people felt sorry for that guy i will never understand.This movie on the other hand did a good job of making me feel sorry for the main villain ghost. When her motives are explained i actually felt sorry for her. Everything that character did she did to survive and that made her a more sympathetic villain than killmonger, in my opinion.Yes i have probably angered people just by saying that but hey its my opinion right, no one has to agree with me if they don't want to. I should also mention, thumbing my review down because you don't like what I've said wont make me angry or change my mind it will only make me laugh. So frankly I don't give a flying crap if I'm thumbed down lol.Getting back to the review, Ant man and the wasp was a very fun movie. I've seen it twice and its held up very well, and i must say it was very refreshing to watch a great movie after all the Crap movies i saw in 2018, this is definitely one of the better movies of that year.Getting back to the movie, why i think it works are two simple things, its action packed and its fast paced. Those are the main reasons its a great movie. There are many other things i like about it too. The movie was not too long like most movies seem to be now a days. The movie was entertaining and funny and the humour felt natural and not FORCED like a lot of Hollywood humour seems to be. Paul rudd was easily the funniest character in the movie. The actors who play his friends are very funny too, and the scenes when all those guys are together are very fun and put a smile on my face. Sorry Thanos you didn't you just made me want to fall asleep with your boring speeches. Sorry but that's just how i felt, these guys were 100% more interesting than Thanos was. One of ant mans friends may give a speech too but his speech was shorter and it was funny! So it didn't bother me when he did it. Plus the guy was likeable and very entertaining which helps.The movies plot may not be mind blowing or fantastic but it did not need to be. The plot was simple but effective at the same time. The fight scenes chase scenes along with the likeable and funny characters makes ant man 2 a very good movie and its one that i could watch over and over again. There was never a dull moment in the entire movie.When it comes to problems the movie has there really arent any big ones. My only problem if i had to name one would be the villains. I thought they were all lame and not that interesting or intimidating, especially the guy who plays the main male villain, he was very weak and spends most of the movie running away from ant man, or just ordering his men to chase after him and the wasp. The chases were good but the man in charge was not really a threat, he was just all talk and very generic. I thought the female villain ghost was more of a threat than him because she had powers that allowed her to move fast and become invisible. She was at least a slight threat but the boss man and his goons were just kind of lame and forgettable. Ghost was not a good villain either to be honest but i thought she was slightly better than the other guys were but thats only because of her powers. And she at least had the guts to fight ant man and the wasp, and overall she put up an ok fight. Also watching her use her powers was entertaining even if the character was not that strong.Overall the movie was very entertaining regardless of the villains being lame. Even with the weak villains the movie was still great and held my attention from start to finish. I thought it was equally as great as the first movie and the effects were great too just like they were in the first movie. The chase scenes and humour were great especially the scene when ant man becomes jumbo sized lol. I don't know what else to say except watch this movie! its a must see."
270,7,"Fun, But Forgettable There's nothing awful about this movie, it's a canon continuation of the marvel cinematic universe, but nothing pops out about this movie. Comedy was great, plot was ok, but there's something missing. Not that I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie, but just a heads up before seeing it."
271,10,"Best Sequel to a movie I loved this movie very much and surprisingly it is way better than the first part. I recommend this movie to everyone whose into action, storyline and comedy. MCU brings another great movie with amazing CGI effects. ITS A MUST WATCH IF YOU ARE INTO THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE."
272,9,"Ant Man and the Wasp Doesn't Shrink Away From Other Films in the MCU Although an Ant sized film when compared to other Marvel movies such as Avengers: Infinity war or Black Panther, Ant Man and the Wasp brings a well balanced film to the table. Ant Man and the Wasp ain't as flashy as its country parts in the MCU, but it stands out as a much needed reprieve from our typical superhero romp, it brings a solid amount of action, enough to keep the audience focused, a solid amount of comedy, something that the Ant Man movies have always had over other Marvel films, an outstanding acting performance and a excellent supporting cast, but more importantly the plot of the movie doesn't full revolve around a good vs. evil concept like so many other superhero movies, it shows us that it's not always black and white there's some gray in there to.Ant Man and the Wasp starts Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) explaining to his daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), how her mother, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was lost in the quantum realm when Hank and Janet had to stop a missle launched during the Cold War. Fast forward or present time and we Find Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) his under house arrest for his actions as Ant Man in Captain America: Civil War, at the tail end of his sentence he has dream of Hanks wife Janet, which prompts Hank and Hope, for all intents and purposes, to kidnap Scott to help them find Janet in the quantum realm. Problems arise when their lab, which can be shrunk to the size of a briefcase, is stolen by the elusive Ghost, who has the ability to phase through objects, which causes Scott to redawn the Suit to help Hope, who has become the Wasp, and Hank get the lab back and save Janet from the quantum realm.If Ant Man and the Wasp boost about one thing it's an excellent supporting cast. Scott Lang's, friends and now cow-workers Luis (Micheal Peña), Dave (Tip Harris), and Kurt (David Dastmalchian) make recurring appearances through the the film to both help move the plot along and provides some nice comic relief. Akin to the first film Luis has a scene where he narrates over past events with a comedic tone and dialogue, he is described by Kurt as a ""human jukebox"", the scenes like this really help evacuate the film and keep it entertaining throughout the whole movie.Another positive aspect of Ant Man and the Wasp is that our main antagonist it's a some strictly evil being, like Thanos or Red Skull, rather a character that isn't inherits evil or bad, but someone who feels alone and betrayed and like anyone else only wants to survive and live on. Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) comes as Hank Pym's past come back to haunt him, which isn't uncommon for superhero or any movie genre for that matter, but the character as stated before isn't evil, she changes things up as for the first half of the film she is an enigma, we don't know how she got her power or why she's doing what she's doing, latter we find out she's the daughter of a former colleague of Hanks, who he had discredited and out continued his research in private which caused a horrible accident which gave ghosts her powers and after Shield, which we know was actually Hydra, took her in they turned her into a weapon. So her characters isn't evil by nature, she was changed by the world around her and only wants to live and have a normal life, which, at least to me, is different than most of the marvel films and adds depth to the movie.Now Ant Man and the Wasp isn't the best movie ever, and like all motives there's some things they could have done better, one thing that Ant Man and the Wasp lacks compared to their Marvel films is the scale and ambition, the Ant Man series don't have the same effect as other entries in the MCU, any of the avenger movies feel like there's more stuff going on, as well they should with a larger cast, but it can keep a audience entertained at times when films like Ant Man and the Wasp feel kinda dull in comparison. This flaw is almost a none issue for this movie though, as where Ant Man and the Wasp lacks in action they make up for it with comedy and levity, and unlike some of the other films in the MCU the cast of Ant Man and the Wasp plays really well of each other and all the actors and actress breath life into their roles and each part of the film entertaining to watch. 'Overall Ant Man and the Wasp expands on its predecessor by bringing in the same feel with new life. While not the perfect film, which I can confidently say does not exist, keeps the audience in tune the whole time, with a great plot, great acting from both the main and supporting cast, all of these help Ant Man and the Wasp grow to new heights."
273,5,"A so-so Marvel movie. Well... Certain parts of the movie are unnecessary. The main antagonist is underwritten. There was a great potential to make her interesting and all but at the end, the only thing I will probably remember is it's Ghost suit. The second antagonist is... just... why this ""Walter Goggins's caracter which I forgot the name"" exists in this movie? He is just the script part that will ""cause"" action or joke scenes. That's it. Speaking of those scenes, the jokes works a little bit and the action sequences, despite they keep the idea of down scaling or up scaling objects to increase the possibilities to see the action at different POV's, are not exceptional. In general, the script is not so great at character developments and the story is predictable. Oh, there are some ya-di ya-da quantic science explanations that means nothing for 99.9% of us. And probably some science inexactitudes.Cool... so why a 5/10 instead of a 4 or even a 3/10? Because... not everything in this movie is a complete trash. Paul Rudd and Michael Peña were very funny in the first Ant-Man, and this is the same thing in the second. The visuals are interesting enough; the vfx team did a good job at making the quantic world. The original score accompanies the film well. And... that's it.At the end, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a Marvel movie and the majority of the viewers can enjoyed it. This is the strict minimum. But it is surely not as good as the first installment nor the best movie in the MCU.Final note: 54/100"
274,7,"'Ant-Man and the Wasp' proves without a doubt, that good things do come in small packages. It was a fun superhero movie! Its takes two to make a thing go right. That's for sure. This twentieth film installment of the MCU & sequel to 2015's 'Ant-Man' was an awesome watch. Based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name, the film once again follows Scott Lang AKA 'Ant-Man' (Paul Rudd) on his adventures into the microverse. This time, trying to rescue Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas)'s wife, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the mini quantum realm. But first, with some help from Pym's daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly) AKA 'the Wasp', he must stop, a black market tech dealer, Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) and ruthless intangible government assassin codenamed ""The Ghost"" (Hannah John-Kamen), from getting their hands on their technology. Without spoiling the film too much; it's would probably be wise to watch 2016's film 'Captain America: Civil War', before seeing this movie from director, Peyton Reed. Why? It's because, much of Lang's storyline in this, is entangled with what happen in Germany. Regardless, the film does a decent job of summing all the events, leading up to current day. However, some people might hate all the exposition dump. After all, some of the information can be a bit overwhelming to take. For example, all the pseudoscience mumbo jumbo does gets a bit ridiculous to the point that the movie had to make a joke about it. Nevertheless, there is one thing that the motion picture didn't do good job, explaining and that's antagonist's origins. I really find it hard to believe, that 'The Ghost' was a stealth operative for S.H.I.E.L.D for a very long time, yet she was not use in the Avengers Initiative nor the organization split up in 2014 at all. You would think, she would had some sort interaction with any previous Marvel hero, before, this film. Yet, this is the first time, we are hearing about her. Another thing, the movie doesn't do a good job, explaining, is delving into if her father, Elihas Starr (Michael Cerveris) was a disgraced spy for HYDRA or not. It's really disappointing, because her father had a bigger role in the comics. Here, he is just a toss away character. Despite that, I do like, most of the updates, the writers, Andrew Barrer, Gabriel Ferrari, Rudd, and Adam McKay did with her. They made a character that originally, a one-dimensional bitter old man, into a new compelling sympathetic force of nature. Hannah's performance was great. Her frustrations, rage, and determination are evident in every scene she is in. However, her character does a lot of stupid things, for somebody who supposed to be a highly trained assassin. I guess, showing trouble with her powers to the point, that it is slowly killing her body is a great way to explain, how frantic & clumsy, this person can be, when trying to gain the tech. Regardless, you still really do buy into that, she might go through about any means necessary, just to survive. I just wish, the movie had the balls to allow her to go there. Nevertheless, I felt the Deux ex Machina ending with her was a bit of a cop-out. As for the other villains. I hate that Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) was downplay to the point, that he doesn't pose much of a threat. For somebody, once known as 'Goliath', he's pretty much a minor character. Sucks that there wasn't no two giants fighting it out battle. That would had been cool. As for Sonny Burch. He could had been a decent antagonist. Unfortunately, the movie treat him as a common comic relief. Don't get me wrong, Goggins is hilariously in this typical sleazy role, but a little more overtly dramatic performance could had made him, seem a little more fun to watch than a semi annoying bugger. Talking about villains, whatever happen to the rogue agent that got hold of Pym particles in the end of the last movie? It has never been addressed. As for the heroes. Lilly was phenomenal as the Wasp. She totally kick butt. Glad, they didn't turn her into a villain, just yet. Honestly, I hope, they don't take the Red Queen route. As for Douglas. He was great. Still, I would love to see his character's several split personalities issues come up, one day. As for Rudd; he is great, as the everyday man who happens to be a superhero. Yet, the whole mind possession gimmick acting with Janet was a bit too odd for my taste. Regardless, the most frustrating thing about Rudd's character, was very misguided, weak ass mistake, Lang does with the ex-con buddies that sets up the third act. I found his actions to be, illogical and out of place, for somebody who is a seasonal criminal. It was a bit annoying. I blame that on the writers. The ex-con buddies' part, felt once again, not needed. Nevertheless, most of the characters are likeable. The humor does shine here; much at Scott's expense after his malfunctioning regulator leaves him temporarily stuck at different sizes. However, it does beg the question, how he can quickly recovered in a few minutes, being over 80 feet tall, yet in 'Civil War', he need to three days for 65 feet. Regardless, the hot potato action scenes with the lab were very fun to watch, especially the car chase and the fight in the kitchen. Please, do yourself a favor and see this movie in IMAX 3D & don't forgot to watch to post-credits scene here, it's massively important to the plot of 2019's film, 'Avengers Endgame'. You deserve to see all the awesomeness with the added dimensions these formats bring, including the wonderful Stan Lee cameo. Overall: Despite having no answers for 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War' fans. In the big picture, it was a lighthearted palate cleanser film that was really needed to be seen. It's entertaining to watch. So check it out! It's a small wonder."
275,7,"Perhaps even better than Ant Man (2015) This movie was, like the first Ant-Man a bit funny but did not subvert the superhero genre. Paul Rudd (as Ant Man) and Evangeline Lilly (as Hope/Wasp) play a great role carrying the movie along. They are the driving force of the movie. Michael Luis, along with his two compatriots, area bit of bumbling fools, once again. They are supposed to be comic relief but it doesn't work. There were cool effects like making their lab small and all, and the character of ""Ghost"" as well. This movie, more than the others, directly ties into the Marvel Universe (especially in the post-credits scene), making you want to watch other superhero movies in theory.There is more than this. The superheros in this movie are a bit like Iron Man or Batman in that they do not have superpowers but just gadgets, but are treated on the same level as others. I am reminded of Gil Scott-Heron's Ain't No Such Thing As Superman, where he sings that ""Yes so tell me why/Can't you understand that there ain't no such thing as a superman?/ There ain't no such thing as a superman...You alone consider mercy after it seems like all you get is pain/It seem to me that you have found the courage that others could not find/You alone have the wisdom to take this world and make it what it need to be, want to be, will be, someday you'll see/The day, the day you understand/That there ain't no such thing as a superman/There ain't no such thing as a superman."" That brings us back to this film in that the technology they use is basically being hoarded, not shared with the world, just like T'Challa did not want to share the discoveries made with his magical technology with the world, which has a disgusting, elitist tenor to it. So that perhaps is one of the most disturbing parts of this movie.In the end, I would probably not watch this movie again either but it was a but fun, although annoying in how much it ties into the genre."
276,1,"Completely forgettable If someone ever asks me what is the story of the movie...I honestly wouldn't know what to tell them. The movie has no point. I just wanted to watch a movie with good CG and at least a half decent story. The CG was good but the story was absolutely forgettable. Watch only if you have watched every other movie in the world and can't think of absolutely anything else to watch and don't have anything available to watch. Watch a Logan Paul Vlog instead, but don't waste your time with this."
277,3,"Expected much more from this sequel! 3/10 Review: After watching Avengers: Infinity War, this movie is a right joke. It's more like a Carry On movie than a superhero film, and the jokes weren't even that funny. When the Ant-man was supposed to knuckle down and battle against evil, he still was splurting out these unfunny lines, which became extremely annoying after a while. Also, his superpowers have lost the shock factor, and it didn't help that the super suit didn't work half of the time. The so-called enemy was also pretty useless, but the first fight against the Wasp wasn't too bad. The storyline had way too many holes in it, and there were loads of times that they could have shrunk to get out of certain situations. I did enjoy the first movie, but this sequel really did need a re-write. With that aside, it's still an important movie in the Marvel world because I'm sure that the Quantum Realm will play a big part in the Avengers coming face to face with Thanos again. Anyway, two years after Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was placed on house arrest due to his involvement with the Avengers in violation of the Sokovia Accords, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) briefly manage to open a tunnel to the quantum realm. They believe Hank's wife Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) might be trapped there, after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When Scott had previously visited the quantum realm, he had unknowingly become quantumly entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her. With only days left of house arrest, Scott contacts Hank about Janet, despite the strained relationship they have due to Scott's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Hank kidnap Scott, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park). Believing the message from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. Now, on paper, the concept sounds pretty impressive but the director made the whole film as a comedy, which took away the deep complexity of the quantum realm. Michael Douglas tries to bring some depth to the whole movie, along with his daughter but it's swept under the carpet, because of it's silly characters which include a black market dealer, Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins), who has been selling Hope parts needed for the tunnel. Sonny soon realises the potential profit that can be earned from Hanks research and tries to double-cross them. During a fight with Sonny's men, Hope is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman ""Ghost"" (Hannah John-Kamen) who escapes with Hanks lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase. Hank reluctantly visits his estranged partner Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne), who helps them to locate the lab but the Ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father Elihas, another of Hanks former partners, died along with his wife during the experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Now with all this going on, you would think that the movie would be entertaining..... well your wrong. There is a sense of intensity with Ava, which made her mysterious at the beginning but it doesn't really lead to anything. The same goes for Bill Foster, who was quite important to the plot but he didn't make a big impact. When they finally get the tunnel going, and Hank retrieves Janet from the quantum realm, she helps Ava and they live happily ever after. What poor writing! If it wasn't for the ending, which connects this movie to Infinity War, the whole film would have been pointless. I'm sure that I would have to watch this movie again, once Endgame comes out, but I really thought that it had Disney's footprint all over it. If they release another Ant-man movie, they really need to bring some seriousness to the script because this film really wasn't my cup of tea. Disappointing!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Peyton Reed, who also brought you Bring It On in 2000, Down With Love starring Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger, The Break-Up, Yes Man and the first Ant-Man movie. The only reason why I think he was chosen to direct, is because of Paul Rudd comedic background, but apart from that, I personally think that he was the wrong choice. You can easily add wit to movies without making it a full out comedy, which I felt this movie was, and it always helps if it is actually funny, which this movie wasn't. The fact that there were 5 writers, which included Paul Rudd, might explain why the movie felt like a right mess. They all had there own vision of what they wanted from the character, which is why you have the family element, along with the love element and the saving the world element. Mixed with bad comedy, all of these elements just didn't work in this film but I think that it's the beginning of something bigger, which Marvel is keeping close to there chest. Although it made a decent profit, and the critics thought that it was a much-needed MCU palate cleanser, I personally thought that some of the action scenes were half decent, but that's about it.Budget: $195million Worldwide Gross: $623millionGenre: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi Cast: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michael Pena, Walton Goggins, Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, T.I., Randall Park, Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne. 3/10"
278,7,Much better than the first Worth a watch film. You know what you're getting with these films and unlike all the other films this one isn't so bad so switch off and enjoy a no brain Sunday flick. Don't turn off after it finishes watch till the very end 🤗
279,8,"What's wrong with likable? ""Antman"" was one of the first Marvel films that I saw. It was approachable and fun!Same here! In an age when we're inundated with a lot of brooding heroes, Antman and his friends are refreshing and uplifting. What's wrong about being light-hearted and likable?I've never liked Michael Douglas as much as in this series. The chemistry of the major characters is excellent. Even Scott's daughter's dad-in-law is pretty cool.And moreover, it's nice to see real life consequences to what happened in ""Civil War."" The script and story could have been better, but the actors and their dialogue make up for it.The ending fits in perfectly with Infinity War. Can't wait to see Scott back in Endgame."
280,3,This movie took 2 hours of my life. Bad boring scenarie like many others about superheroes _ non stop all about the same.
281,7,"The Real heroes are not always Big... Continuing on where we last saw our small superhero (after Captain America: Civil War), Scott (aka Ant-Man), is currently under house arrest with 2 days remaining until he can receive his freedom once again. Along with this, Scott is also struggling to deal with being both super Hero and a father, trying to have a balance of both in his life.As Scott kills time by learning new magic tricks, playing the drums and singing Karaoke, he soon comes in contact with both Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who require Scott's help on a new secret mission dealing with their past...Scott will once again suit up and risk house arrest as he works alongside a new partner known as ""The Wasp"". Not only does this film develop the character of The Wasp, but to my surprise it almost makes this new character out-do Ant-man himself. Scott can at times feel like more of a helper or a comedy side kick instead of carrying the main superhero focus that I expected. The film also managed to introduce not only one, but multiple villains and bad guys into the mix, keeping the film's pace snappy.Unlike other Marvel films, Ant-man and The Wasp delivers basic visual effects which are not super bright or colourful (say, like Thor: Ragnorok), but the film still manages to get creative with effects when it comes to our heroes running around as small or large people. It's always entertaining to see some of the creative ideas, such as small cars driving in a high octane car chase. It's moments like these that keep the film different to the previous instalment.While the film take place around the same time as Avengers: Infinity War, I would encourage movie fans to view this film without the same hype of the previous Marvel film. Anything near the same level of excitement as Avengers only occurs more so at the end (and stay for the film's end credits). I also recommend viewers to be up to date, making sure they have at least watched the 1st Ant-Man and Captain America: Civil War before viewing this.As for the plot, it's pretty light and I found many moments rather questionable with gaps in the story. Without going into spoilers, the film will introduce many new concepts about the past and present, but many discussions had with main characters can be so complex and wordy they are hard to understand. But hey, it's a Marvel Movie- if you can accept it and enjoy the ride it can be rewarding. Despite this, there are plenty of questions within the future of our favourite Marvel heroes.Overall, the film delivered pretty much what I expected being Marvel. It's enough of a story line to keep the Marvel universe ticking along. I was surprised to see the so called lead take a slight step back as the film promoted The Wasp character. As a film, it's not up there with the other great Marvel films such Iron Man or Captain America, but it is light and entertaining enough that many will find enjoyment.7.4/10 Walkden Entertainment"
282,6,"No vision, but still fun This movie has no vision, no memorable and creative action sequences and the characters don't evolve. But still is fun and with a solid story and solid cgi. The story is poorly done and the art e style is generic and ugly to watch even in the quantum realm."
283,8,"do not take it serious Guess it's a new style of doing superhero flicks. Don't take it all too serious and be open-minded for jokes added into situations. This flick does great on that part when everything is little in teh normal world. I mean, we do have more situations were outfits have errors and the antman is too big or too small. It do gives some funny moments.But not only that, effects are really stunning and the movie doesn't have any weak moments. People brag about it's the same as the firts one, of course it is, it's about Antman.I enjoyed it and I am more into those superhero flicks with a joke here and there.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1,5/5"
284,3,"This movie is not faithful to it's own universe. I love Marvel movies since the beginning, but this is the first time I felt that the movie wanted me to look stupid. I accepted all the rules of the first one, like the number of the atoms in the object remains the same, that's why it's mass remains the same, that makes Ant-Man so powerful in small scale. But this one jumps over one rule to another like it was a hopscotch... this movie was frustrating. And I'm still not mentioned the other problems that many of the viewers and critics mentioned. This movie is bad on so many levels that hurts."
285,8,"Funny hodgepodge This is one of those movies where they try very hard to make something new. So premises are detached one from another. If you decide not to digest it all, the film will have no sense to you. However, if you, like me, get over it and take the fun for what it is, the film is very enjoyable.Some things do look artificial at first, not naturally becoming part of your, viewer's, angle. The main problem is, new things are not explored, if you have all that power and abilities would you exploit them the way it is depicted in the movie?This is more of a logical gap that is missing, so there is nothing you can do about it. You need to accept it as it is. But the actions scenes, dialogs, characters are funny at least. Far from perfect in any sense, but funny.I am sure that when I watch this movie again I will find these moments of invented physics either even more annoying or simply totally ignorable. I do not have urge to watch this movie again. But I might.The secret ending is marvelous. Do not miss it."
286,9,Fun comes in all shapes and sizes This second installment was as good as the first one...and for Hollywood that's never easy to do.
287,8,Funny! Just a other movie from marvel studios.But this movie make me thing about the universe Marvel and next movie from AVENGERS!
288,8,"Just good and is just a cute little movie I think i overrated this movie the first time I saw it, but upon re watch it still held up. The jokes all still landed and the ending was still satisfying. The plot is not that complex, but as a fan of the MCU I still loved the characters and prefer this to the first Ant Man movie. Not much to say just a fun enjoyable movie."
289,8,Like a loot This is method see how funny is be small . Need to see good Hero Story.
290,7,"As entertaining as the first one, even if maybe not as good. There are obvious logic issues when you think too much about a lot of what is happening throughout the movie but if you just push suspension of disbelief passed what would usually be acceptable this is still a very entertaining movie. The antagonist(s) are not the most interesting but for both the humor and the essential building block towards Endgame, I still recommend it!"
291,8,"Predictable, well made fun It doesn't take any risks or do anything new, which makes it feel like a slight step back coming after Infinity War and Black Panther but it's a fun and fast paced comic book movie elevated by great action, visuals, and consistently funny humour. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Michael Peña and Evangeline Lilly all give great performances and Laurence Fishburne is a welcome addition. Peyton Reed's direction is also great."
292,7,Meh It's okay but the plot is very weak and predictable.
293,6,"Worst film of the MCU so far, but still enjoyable This movie relies on a lot of laughs, sometimes at the expense of believability. The story is also predictable. But with that said, the humor is mostly funny, and some of the action sequences are also very cool."
294,3,"Too Much Ends Up As Very Little Way too much thrown into this film with way too little thought about how to tie it together. There are at least six plot-lines going on (saving Janet, Ghost, bad guys trying to steal the lab, Scott's family drama, Scott's security business, Scott's house arrest & FBI). Throw in the multiple personal relationships that are part of this (Hank-Janet-Hope, Scott-Hope, Scott-daughter, Hank-Bill, Bill-Ghost) and it's way too much. On top of this, the pseudo-science is bad and never explained. When things shrink, do they get lighter or not? If not, you can't carry a building around. (Plus nothing can keep everything inside in place as it gets tossed like a football.) If so, then a bug-sized person can't deliver any kind of a punch. The quantum realm becomes a random do-anything power that's never explained, nor are Janet's powers after 30 years there. (Of course, she's a brilliant scientist like Hank instead of a playgirl socialite like in the comics. And gets smarter after years alone and without anything in the realm. All part of the Disney PC, like the rainbow casting.) Bugs can fly and tiny vehicles can drive faster than speeding vehicles. (Calculate how fast those tiny wheels would have to spin to do so.) Scott somehow made a 'quantum entanglement' that allows a mental (!) connection with Janet across the realm. Etc. Etc. As far as acting, Rudd tries hard to span expectations but gets lost in the shuffle. Douglas has too big a role. Lilly has zero chemistry with Rudd; comes from trying to be the butt-kicking fem-warrior. She seems way too invested in a mom that she knew only 30 years ago as a small girl. Michael Pena though IS hilarious, as are Scott's other security team. Fishburne is extraneous. Ghost only has to act desperately pained. Pfieffer tries to make up for her short screen time by overdoing it. Adds little to the MCU, even the obligatory after-credit scenes with an unnamed 'other' ghost and Scott apparently trapped when the Avengers 3 climax kicks in. See it if it's free and you have two hours to waste."
295,2,Boring movie I lost everything that the movie had to offer within the first thirty minutes. Nothing special ever happened until the ending cut scene.
296,9,Enjoyed it ! Still so much suspense for End Game The Movie revolves around an innocent girl who was heavily affected by a unexpected research that happened in S.H.I.E.L.D . Its was supervised by Dr. Hank Pym. So the girl Ava was somehow recovered and her abilities were turned into capabilities that later turned her into Ghost with her disease - Molecular disequilibrium and hence was appointed as stealthed secret weapon . Also the Ant-Man is still confused about his experience in the quantum world. With Luis there were no time phase to get boredom. So the team successfully found theories for the 4th dimension (Time). And ultimately tries to get back to the world's Timeline.
297,1,"Ouch! What a bad movie. My wife and I waited for something interesting to happen for 20 minutes but all we got was a bunch of distracting disconnected scenes with dialogue that was painful to hear. The plot was hidden so well you couldn't find it, until the end, when the effects got your heart pumping just a bit. There was no build up to a climax, there was nothing I would expect in a Marvel movie. Even the cameo by Stan Lee was uninteresting, unfunny and sort of pointless. This is a screenplay cooked up by a committee that did not have a destination in mind. Good SEs tho."
298,3,"The carefree humor of Ant-Man is replaced with lazy PC tokenism The first Ant-Man was a pleasant surprise. I think the writers knew that audiences would react to the character with an emphatic ""who the F cares about Ant-Man?"" so instead of trying to pull another character from obscurity and launch them into a household name as with Iron Man 1, they decided to have some fun and not take themselves too seriously. And with Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, the formula worked.But SJW-types just couldn't have that for the sequel. The sequel required that Paul Rudd not just share the stage with a more badass and skilled female counterpart, but give up the stage to her when it's painfully obvious she has none of the wit or charm or charisma as Rudd. Furthermore, we're given the villain that Ant-Man must face off against--some college girl in lulu lemon with extremely ambiguous powers and a backstory and motivation crammed into 5 minutes of the cringiest exposition in a marvel movie yet. But hey, her parents are an obligatory token PC interracial couple! (YAY SJW points!).This movie, as evidenced by the poster art even on this website, suffers from ""actors playing masked superheroes who are too good looking and narcissistic to wear their characters' masks syndrome"". Whereas in Ant-Man, when both the hero and villain were in their suits, they were in them head to toe. But surely because we couldn't hide our female hero and female villain behind silly character helmets/masks, any character in a suit or costume is removing their helmet or mask literally every time they have dialog. Superheroes removing their mask or helmet used to mark a significant moment in these movies--either the hero showed they were willing to risk their identity by removing it, or it was so damaged it was no longer useful, or it was removed at the end of the movie for a heartwarming monologue or conversation. But in this movie, it's almost as if they can't wait to remove them, even during action sequences where it makes no sense at all.Finally, the whole plot of the movie is very flimsy and the stakes don't seem very high. Basically Hank Pym, decades after his wife's disappearance as explained in the first movie, decides she is still alive and can be rescued. Besides that, this movie really only exists to remind the audience multiple times that Ant-Man was in Captain America Civil War, and clumsily justify his absence from Avengers Infinity War.Overall it was a disappointing sequel to what was a sleeper hit in the MCU."
299,6,"I can't explain why I liked it I liked Ant-Man and the Wasp more than the original Ant-Man movie and I'm not quite sure why. After all, this sequel's story is overly complicated, pretty predictable and relies heavily on pseudo-scientific babble to move the plot along. Nevertheless, I was entertained, and found myself laughing more than I thought I would. I can't explain it, much like how this movie can't explain quantum physics."
300,2,"Ant-kin Approved Ant-Man was a film I enjoyed at parts, but I felt it was lacking compared to most Marvel origin stories. Many positives were still apparent in it, such as a fantastic cast and interesting interactions, but unfortunately the film always felt it was coming up short from what it should have been. Watching the official trailer, you get the idea the film is going to be a high-octane flick upping the ante on silly, but unfortunately this consisted of a few action sequences.The sequel on the other hand benefits greatly from not spending valuable screen time setting up many new characters and gizmos and instead building on those it had previously set up. Though this film may not be as fun as Thor: Ragnarok or Guardians of the Galaxy, it is a vast improvement over its predecessor, benefiting from witty character banter and creative special effects.Early on, I had a good feeling about the film. Scott is introduced with his daughter as they are navigating their way through a cardboard labyrinth with the aid of a giant paper-mache ant, and it ends with Scott accidentally putting his foot through his front-yard fence, just barely triggering an FBI response. The main element of tension throughout the film is immediately set up in a comedic manner while providing a quality character moment.The character interactions are one of my favorite elements of the film. It feels like what was attempted in the first Ant-Man is now realized, as Hank comes across as more of a likeable jerk this time around, and all of his scenes Scott are fantastic, especially a rather interesting scene in which Paul Rudd must switch between acting as Scott and Janet, Hank's wife, a performance reminiscent of Jack Black's in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.This movie felt much more tonally consistent than a number of other Marvel flicks due to its emphasis on comedy. Inconsistent tone can be seen throughout Doctor Strange, for instance, which starts with a very heavily flawed character and the story has many moments of tragedy throughout it which are immediately followed with an almost rhythmic response of inappropriate comedy which steals from the drama. On the flipside, in this film we have a comedic film with dramatic moments which serve a clear purpose, such as motivating our villain, Ghost, or providing moments to show character depth, as the opening scene showing how Janet gets lost in the quantum realm, and allows us to better understand why Hank is now such a bitter person. I appreciated the relaxed delivery of comedic quips throughout the film as it went on, as it felt confident enough that the jokes would hit often enough that they could refrain from bombarding the audience with an onslaught of dull lines, aside from a single instance in which that in and of itself is the joke. I tend to hate self-aware comedy, but I find cringe comedy quite entertaining. Whereas Deadpool's cliche plot can be safety-netted by it being a self-aware parody of the genre, Luis' vastly outdated ""Wassssup?"" reference could have been objectively unfunny were it executed poorly, despite being a wink-wink sort of joke. Though the humor in this film is far from sophisticated, I found myself chuckling much more frequently through this one than I did through the first.Special effects are vastly more impressive with this film, as there are numerous visual gags involving interesting interactions with vastly scaled objects, and the CGI is polished enough to which there weren't moments that broke the immersion despite the abundance of special effects this time around. There's always objects around to show the scale, such as birds being beside the miniature car as they're driving, and characters often interact seamlessly with objects while miniature, such as when the Wasp runs on the thrown knife, or hides upon the chandelier. The suits never feel underused in action sequences, and there are an abundance of them this time around. While CGI is certainly overused in general, it is rarely interacted with in such an engaging and creative manner.If there was anything that felt underdeveloped in the film, it was Ava Starr, or Ghost. Though her motivation felt adequate, I felt her accomplice Bill Foster made for a much more nuanced character. Ava felt too one-dimensional and too detached from any other character to where it was nearly impossible to sympathize with her despite the fact that she's literally dying throughout the film, and I'm reminded all too much of Matt Damon's character in Elysium being a selfish sociopath with the same motivation. Despite an opportunity for a strong arc by the end of the film, she ultimately seems like nothing more than a plot device as the movie promptly wraps up as soon as the immediate threat is solved, with the last few minutes tying Ant-Man into Infinity War. It's rather anticlimactic as there is a great deal of buildup leading to an ultimately lackluster payoff in the climax of the film. It's a shame that the chaser to Infinity War, the most villain-centric film of the MCU, had a villain who felt like an afterthought with her defining character trait being that she's constantly suffering.Honestly, if you are more concerned about the Avengers, this film is not a necessity, but it certainly works fine on its own as an action comedy. I feel this one's much in line with the first one, but it accomplishes a lot more and the strong elements in the original are more of a focus this time around."
301,5,Both sides are fighting and killing each other for the same thing? Did this make much sense to anyone? Both sides wanted the same thing but kept getting in the other's way. I just didnt care...The movie is very shallow...even though there is a lot of potential with the subatomic world and all...
302,9,"We may well be in the ""Endgame"" Now! Paul Rudd, now teamed up with Evangeline Lily, both become the dynamic duo of the MCU. They both exceed to high-expectations as the MCU's two partners in crime, with a great time-travelling, looking heist movie. The antagonist is a bit flat, but it really IS the two-shrinking superheroes the movie carries.Michelle Pfeiffer delivers an exhilarating surprise as Janet van Dyne, and she is fantastic how she appears, i.e. the Quantum Realm says it all. The Quantum Realm is a fantastic use of opportunity to bring something eye-opening to next year's Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame. It's brilliantly told!The movie's synopsis; to learn secrets of the past, and to save Janet van Dyne. It's a splendid 2hrs of brilliant fun to the MCU. Could Ant-Man be the key to victory next summer? We'll have to wait and see! So watch this movie, it's fun! And the MCU once again, never disappoints!"
303,9,"Perfect Action Comedy!! Witty, fast paced, all actors are top-notch and fit perfectly into the ragtag, zany team. Michael Douglas is just a pleasure to watch. His constant father/son-like bickering on Rudd is hilarious.The script is interesting and what's double great: it's not about saving the world and still has a very meaningful purpose. Loads of human interaction and condition going on, i don't even understand how some people say it's shallow. In my opinion it's one of the least shallow movies of mcu.It was a blast in the cine, constant snickering or laugh out loud moments of the . I had some parts where i had troubles catching breath. Which is good :-)So, I'm very happy with 2018 cinema: with Infinity War and Ant Man we got two Superhero flicks that did not suck!!"
304,4,"An okay movie It was an okay movie however I found it a bit boring for the following reasons: 1. It was a bit too predictable and so it dragged in places. 2. The humour wasn't that funny. 3. The antagonist wasn't scary; in fact I just felt sorry for her. I don't know if that was the intention, but it made the movie bland."
305,3,"This was so stupid I felt like I was watching a kids movie the entire time. The humor was just dumb and the acting even dumber. I'm actually a fan of Paul Rudd's, but his lack of acting skill in this flick just brought the entire mood down. If they ever make another one, I'll skip it."
306,8,"Better Antics than first movie Like most, i have been sucked into the MCU, for the past 10 years, they have entertained me for the most part(wasnt a fan of Incredible Hulk) up until Ant-Man. Paul Rudds original outing did not sell it to me. I like Rudd and the films director, Peyton Reed, but for me, Ant-Man was missing a certain appeal. The appeal that made me fall in love with the Cap, Iron man, Thor, Avengers movies. I left disappointed and when the sequel was released, i was in no rush to watch. After buying this title for my son, i can say that i regret waiting to watch this. Ant-Man and the Wasp was an absolute joy. Funny, smart, action packed storyline. It was a fun ride and honestly i would not mind another few sequels. I dont know why i didnt take to Ant-Man, but it doesnt matter, because Ant-Man and the Wasp more than made up for it for me.I would recommend this as a Marvel must-see. For me at the moment, so close to the end of the MCU story, this holds a place in the top 5 films of the franchise."
307,1,Bad movie with no outcome Didnt have more words for this movie didn't know where they going like Tom-com or action one villain in movie don't know why he is there lol there cringe worthy movement and also good is amazing visual effect for no use
308,10,"An Honest Review As with the last one...Michael Peña is still the best part of the movie. He's the heart and soul of the Ant-Man movies. Unfortunately this time his stories aren't made with the same hysterical blunt finesse they were in the past. But that doesn't take away from his delivery.And unfortunately that goes with the rest of the movie.It's fun to watch and entertaining, and that is what matters, but the wind was sort of out of the sails here. Blame it on the script, the acting and direction were fine, they just didn't have a lot to work with."
309,9,"Great Loved it.Great story, great special effects.Better than ant man for me."
310,7,"Great movie! Just one major flaw! Great movie, really enjoyed the story line, acting was excellent and overall action/suspense was perfect! Only one little flaw, when Hanks wife comes back, she totally aged the same 30 years as Hank did, yet everyone who knows anything about sci-fi or quantum physics can tell you that TIME is not relevant in the quantum realm, so why did she age? 😂 Morons lol"
311,2,You don't care for the characters Liking the first movie so much gave me high hopes for this one. Sadly the story is shallow there is no real villain and the humor was weak. Would it be a good kids movie? YES! But not a good superhero movie if compared to others.
312,1,"Not even any good as background noise..... I only signed up to IMDB to review this film. AWFUL. I suppose it is like a PG version of deadpool, but without the humour, the wit or the quality of soundtrack. Michael Douglas didn't sign up on the basis of the script. I gave it 1 star......which is about fair. I like the early Spiderman films, loved Deadpool and was sort of hoping for something inbetween. Unfortunately not. Bit gutted - could have watched the first round of the darts instead........"
313,6,"Sometimes smaller is better... While I can't really claim to be a fan of superheroes or the Marvel universe in particular, then I still do watch these superhero movies when I have the chance, solely because they are entertaining - despite me having very little interest in superheroes, their powers and their adventures.I enjoyed the first ""Ant-Man"" movie because it was so different from the rest of the superhero movies that flooded the movie market. So of course I wanted to watch ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" as well, though I didn't traverse to the cinema to do so.The storyline in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" was a little bit more spaced out than the storyline in the predecessor, for better or worse. I must admit that it was a tad too much for my liking. I am not saying that ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just that the first ""Ant-Man"" movie was far better.Paul Rudd returns as Ant-Man and he carries himself so well in that role, and he really is a nicely casted actor for this particular role. Evangeline Lilly - playing Wasp - was also doing a fair job. They had some nice major acting talents popping up in the movie as well, such as Michael Douglas, Lawrence Fishburne and Michelle Pfeiffer. I must admit that it was a blast to see Michael Peña in the movie and his role was just hilarious. Now, I must admit that I think that the Ghost character - played by Hannah John-Kamen - was severely neglected. That character had so much potential.The special effects in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" were, of course, grand. As they always are in these major Marvel productions. So prepare to be blown away by an array of special effects.All in all an entertaining movie, just a shame that they opted to got a bit overboard with some of the events in the movie and parts of the storyline."
314,6,Just Amazing They mastered the balance between comedy and superhero. Was not expecting that ending though
315,8,Everybody tips the spoon up when losing consciousness... Baba Yaga rears his head again.What is that kind-of out-of-place pray hands with a lean back and a smirk?That was a horrible fake vomit.Whas up :)Time to buy a ticket is correct. I've ridden that boat and even with reservations it talks a long time.I like Agent Woo.
316,9,"I Love Marvel The graphics in this movie are astounding. It's a work of art. I do love Marvel and always have and I'm always happy with what they produce. I found there was a lot of good humour in this one. I don't understand why people whine about the storyline of a comic book movie, for heavens sake these people never had any childhood. If you want a complicated engulfing story go and watch Othello. I love Ant Man and the Wasp. Performance was convincing. it had everything needed for good, funny, light and gripping entertainment."
317,7,"Alright sequel Not the most original or astonishing story, but a well written and entertaining one. It doesn't miss the beats, it delivers what it should and you will definitely crack a laugh or two.I enjoyed the visuals, the enlarging powers of Ant-Man, he first got grasp of in Civil War, were fine addition to his shrinking ones and the filmmakers made great use of them. Villain (not really) in the form of Ghost wasn't really outstanding, she could be replaced with many other Marvel bad guys and the story wouldn't change. The same applies to generic guy in a suit, commanding an army of goons, who will stop at nothing to achieve their masters plan (like we haven't seen that before).Don't think about the physics too much, it won't add any plus points to the movie.My personal favorite moments were delivered by none other than Michael Peña, who got more screentime as a sidekick than the last time.Overall a solid movie, nothing too great but an alright flick to spend an evening with."
318,6,"Better than the first The second Ant-Man movie is not a great part of the MCU, it´s important for what´s going to come, but it´s not a good film.The villain was pretty weak, but we are used to it... The movie really tries to be funny like GotG, but he totally fails. I grinned two times in the movie...But why is it then better than the first?The most important thing is that it does not try to be funny no matter how, like the first part. The gags in this one just didn´t work for me but the best thing about the 2nd part is, that there is no tank!All in all this flick is a very average MCU-Movie, but not one of the top spots. Watch it, because it´s important for the next ,Avebgers´, not because its entertaining."
319,8,Focused and comfortable This movie for me was better than infinity war in many ways. People are celebrating infinity war as a genius movie but it was the event that was crucial. The movie was bad. I mean who jokes around when a massive threat comes to earth. The movie was like porridge and for that i was skeptic for this one(other than that the movie was fine but i will say its overrated) ant man and the wasp is quite good. Some people only hate it only they expect it to be something that this isn't.
320,8,"Better than part 1 imo Gonna make this short - I found this film a lot better than the first one. This a lighthearted unique action hero film focused on family and friendship that has a lot more added than the first movie. There is a lot more excitement and there are no full moments. Part 1 was okay, but something about it felt dull most of the time. This one was a lot more exciting and immersive"
321,9,Lots to think about I think this movie has alot to do with the next avengers. You have to watch end credits in every marvel movie. Ant Mai at the end of this movie gives us a look on how all the people come back from dead
322,7,"Quality I rewatched most of MCU before Infinity War and after IW was in the books decided to take a little break with Marvels. Feels good to dive into MCU again, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a good one, I'd say better than the first. A lively script, good humour - Ant-Mans are probably the quirkiest films in the series.Tried to do a ranking of MCU, but it turned out there are just too many films pretty much tied so I'll just list the big three for me at the moment:Iron Man Spider-Man: Homecoming Avengers: Age of UltronRating: 7/10"
323,10,"LOVE BUG I have to admit upfront that I'm a fanboy when it comes to comic book based movies. The room goes dark, the screen lights up and the images flash across the screen taking me back to those days when I put my dine and two pennies on the counter and walked out with the latest issue of whatever comic book caught my eye that day. Now when the familiar opening of a Marvel film opens with images of the various heroes flashing by I find that thrill kicking in once more.The latest Marvel film to arrive on disc is ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. Picking up after the events of AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR we find Scott Land (Paul Rudd) on house arrest after violating the registration laws and working alongside Captain America. Spending time with his daughter and obeying the rules set in place for him he only has three days left before his ankle monitor comes off. But things are set in motion to threaten his ability to stay on the down low.The opening of the film shows the past, in particular the story of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), two scientists who've donned the roles of superheroes as the original Ant-Man and Wasp. When they try to stop a missile heading into a populated area they can't get inside to defuse it. Janet shrinks to sub-atomic size to stop the missile but the end result is being stuck in the miniature quantum level world.In the previous film you may recall that Scott traveled to this same realm and successfully returned. During that time he made a quantum connection with Janet and now has visions of her. Contacted Hank and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) who are also on the run, they kidnap him and place a decoy in his place. They explain that they've been working on a way to bring back Janet from the quantum realm and need his help due to his connection.Stopping to pick up a piece of equipment from a criminal tech dealer named Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) Hope goes in to get the part only to find he's discovered who they are. A fight ensues, she gets the part but then a new player emerges. A wraith like figure able to transmute through walls and people alike who also wants the part. We later find her name is Ava but due to her abilities they call her Ghost. Why she stole the part, what her link is to this family isn't revealed until later. Also introduced is scientist Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne), an ex-colleague of Hank's with an ego to match.Encounters between bad guys, hiding from the FBI and disentangling just who is who fills out the rest of the film. Of course the overabundance of special effects are frequently on display here but unlike the poorly done CGI images one would associate with a SyFy channel level film these are done to perfection. Sure you know they're special effects but they're done so magnificently that you never even find yourself thinking about it.But the movie wouldn't work if it was only about special effects no matter how well done. It is the story that makes this movie, a rare combination of action, heroics, self-sacrifice and comedy that works on every level. The action runs from start to finish in the adventures the group finds themselves, moving from fights with street level thugs to super villains to dodging the FBI. Here again special effects combines with some of the top stunt men/women who are stupendous here (and still deserve their own Oscar category).The heroics on hand walk hand in hand with the self-sacrifice stories. First is the loss of Janet Van Dyne at the beginning of the film, an apparent loss to both Hank and Hope. Then there is the loss of freedom for Scott. The scenes between Scott and his daughter are touching but not syrupy. She is the one who inspires him to become a better man and thus a better father. And later his affection for Hope drives him to make a decision that could cost him his freedom once more.But the humor here is what balances out the whole film. Everything from quick little jibes to full on life size images like a giant Pez dispenser used as a weapon make for some laugh out loud moments. None of these jokes feels forced or uninspired and all of them work, every single one. Rudd is the perfect actor for this part, able to play the romantic lead and equally adept at tossing out jokes that take place at his character's expense.On the whole this movie is among the better of the Marvel films. It's one I know I could sit down and watch again right now having just watched it and still enjoy without the need to have one finger on the fast forward button. My guess is you'll feel the same way and I can't recommend this one enough. Of special note, as with all Marvel films there are two sequences in the credits, the first tying the movie into the AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR film and the last just a laugh."
324,5,"It tries to be fun an funny, but is very little of either They try to crack a lot of jokes. About a few of them actually work.The try to have fun. The actually get very little.About the only thing good is that it's not boring, which it easily could have been. Ah, yes, we can also be thankful that the whole ""Wasp is a better hero than Ant-Man"" doesn't feel nearly as ""mad feminist"" as a lot of modern mainstream movies.Paul Rudd tries his best, but, it just doesn't work very well. Evangeline Lilly looks very good for her age, but, doesn't play very good. The little girl is OK, but, not as cute as they would like her to be. The ""big guns"" (Michael Douglas, Michele Pfeifer and Laurence Fishburne) seem just to be ""in for the buc... ehm, ride"" and provide very little.Story is even sillier than most comic-book movies, the big ants look more like robots than animals and in several situations you just see/feel that it's a ""CGI movie"".None of this raises to the level of terrible, it's not very bad either, but, it certainly ain't good. The bigger problem is that there's very little it's good at, which makes it not worth your time, unless you're an Ant-man fan."
325,4,Weak I found the storyline to be pretty weak. There was really not much of anything in it. Hank and Scott's joke was really fun to watch but apart from that the movie doesnt have anything else to offer.
326,10,"buzzzzzzzz Having not watched any marvel films really until Avengers infinity war came to the big screen and then this one came along it made me fall in love with the series, i have since got every movie and worked my way through them one by one.This was then my second dip into the marvel world and i fell in love, this one is funny, adventurous, action, tense and a great thriller. It was kind of like Deadpool 1&2 with its humour, The main stars work so well together and the story is understandable, not too complicated and as it should be.it was not too long a film and kept me hooked all the way through, no long winded scenes either.overall a good film with plenty of funny scenes and action along with a great cast"
327,10,Hilarious! What a fun movie! There were several times that I laughed out loud at the many shrink and resize stunts that really entertained the audience! This is a keeper! Great job Marvel!
328,8,"Fun MCU fluff. If you are looking for deep and serious MCU look elsewhere. Ant-Man teams up with the Wasp and Hank ( the original Ant-Man) to find the original Wasp while fighting Ghost and an ambitious industrialist. It's fun, exciting and lighthearted stuff."
329,8,Could be better! I think the Ghost inspired from The Twins in matrix II !
330,10,Awesome Movie Its Crazy & Comedy is too Good. Kitchen Action Scene is Awesome. This Movie my Favorite Scenes 1. kitchen Fight 2. Chasing Road Fight 3. Got Lab on the Ship
331,5,"Lightweight and Inessential; Perhaps a Tension-Breaker for the Post-Thanos Age Why didn't Scott Lang and his incredible resizable crew appear in Infinity War? The answer lies within this, the sequel to 2015's surprisingly charming Ant-Man, and it's... not very convincing? While the universe was literally at risk, his pals on the Avengers struggling against impossible odds, Lang and the Pym family were engaging in a small variety of relatively inconsequential side quests. There's a push to rescue Hank's wife Janet, presumed dead for decades, and an under-explained foil who keeps getting in the way at inopportune moments, but neither of those feel like headline plot points, let alone something that would supersede the call to lend a hand against Thanos.The film also struggles to match its predecessor's easygoing sense of humor and impressive eye for scale or wonder. We get some inspired re-sizes, like the shrinking suitcase building with wheels and a handle, or the Pym family's carrying case of Hot Wheel-sized vehicles, but those are easy wins which don't take my breath away like the bathtub / dance floor scene did in the first film. Inessential at best, it'll fill the need if you're just dying for more giant ants and don't particularly care about what they're doing or where they're headed. I don't feel like I wasted my time, but I also don't think I'll ever need to watch it again."
332,9,My favorite Marvel Movie!!!! Omg I loved this movie.. Right from the first scenes this movie pulled me in. Visual effects were brilliantly handled. Loved Paul his comic is great in this movie. Also loved how they showed father daughter relationships in the movie. U might find too much geeky at times but you can adapt to it over course of movie. As in the case of any Marvel movie don't miss the post credit scenes😜
333,5,"Fairly feeble attempt at a super hero comedy. I did indeed enjoy this movie...somewhat. However I cannot say that I was overly impressed.The story was okay. I would not expect a deep and thought provoking story from a super hero movie nor would I want it. It served as a decent enough vehicle for moving things forward.Most of the actors did a good enough job of the role they were given which in some cases was pretty much mission impossible given some of the overly silly characters in the movie. In particular I got tired of Luis almost before the first scenes he was in had finished. He was just so silly that you started to wonder what age the target audience was. Jimmy Woo was not far behind.I think this leads to my main gripe with the movie. I expected a super hero movie but what I got was a fairly lame comedy with super heroes in it. It was just too much comic elements in it for me. I could probably have liked it if the jokes were somewhat intelligent but, for me, they were not. They alternated between overly silly and stupid characters, slap-stick and simple fall-on-your ass jokes.What about the bad guy? Well, first off, there was not really a distinct bad guy but a hole bunch of them. Unfortunately none of them had any real bad guy charisma. I assume that Sonny was supposed to be the main bad guy and he certainly had enough evil lunatic air about him to fit that but again...too silly. Then we have the lame Jimmy Woo who was just annoying. The Ghost was probably the best one but then she was not really a bad guy was she?I did like most of the action and the special effects though. The playing around with shrinking and returning to normal size, or greater, was both cool and funny. This shrinking business is of course a difficult theme to work with from a science and logic point of view. For instance, if you shrink a car to the size of a toy car it still weighs like a full size one and you cannot just pick it up. And what about the lab popping up and down all the time? Why weren't everything shaken to bits inside when they started to run around with it? And don't get me started about electricity and plumbing. But then, in this kind of movie I would say just just have to turn off that part of your brain. It made for some cool scenes after all.I also did like that the story was more of a down to Earth story. No overall galactic plot, no snapping of fingers to make...well you know what. Okay, there was the post credit scenes which was a bit of an annoying tie in. Perhaps best of all though, I could not really feel much SJW or other form of politically correct preaching being showed down my throat. Today that is a great plus for any movie.So, to sum up, I did enjoy it but it was not great and I was indeed a little bit disappointed at the end."
334,5,"Ok but nought special It's ok but a lot of this film is pretty flat. As others have said, the jokes are flat, the baddies are flat, the story is flat, even the characters are flat. Compared to the first Ant man (which was a lot of fun), this film is just by the numbers. I honestly didn't care who won or lost by the end. At the end of the day, it's ok but there's no depth to this film thus making it pretty bland. 5/10."
335,8,"Movies are SUPPOSED to be fun! Way, way too much hate being thrown on this movie. Not every movie needs to be a cinematic masterpiece of deep philosophy and layered plots. Sometimes it just needs to be entertaining and fun. And this movie delivers on those points. If you can just let go and have fun, you'll enjoy this as a short escape from real life. Like movies should be. Enjoy."
336,5,"The worst Marvel film since Thor: The Dark World There's a lot of seriousness at play in Marvel film's, so it's always nice to get a silly and throwaway entry into the comic book giants film offerings.Sure there's hearty laughs to be found in most Marvel films, there's the oddities of the Guardians gang and teenage sass in Spiderman but the property of Ant-Man offers up a genuinely family friendly caper that's absolutely made for laughs more than thrills and spills.The first Ant-Man (seemingly against all the odds after behind the scenes issues) became a likeable if forgettable outing, that once more established the easy to like charms of its leading man Paul Rudd, yet while Ant-Man and the Wasp takes a very similar approach to its proceedings, this sequel is the movie giants most forgettable film since Thor: The Dark World from 2013 and feels rather tired when compared to its counterparts.The charm of Rudd is still evident, the jokes come thick and fast (but don't always land), Michael Pena is still around to play a hyperactive support and the film tries hard to re-establish jokes around the universe of becoming ant-sized or giant sized (Paul Rudd as a school student or whale sightings) but getting bogged down in a rather uninteresting story of Michael Douglas's and Evangeline Lilly Hank Pym and daughter Hope/Wasp trying to enter the Quantum Realm and find their long lost wife/mother Janet, Ant-Man and the Wasp isn't as fun and frivolous as it should be.With such a loaded plotline that also includes for no real reason Walton Goggins black market dealer Sonny Burch, Laurence Fishburne's one time S.H.I.E.L.D employee and scientist Dr. Bill Foster and Hannah John-Kamen's ""villain"" of the piece Ghost, the playful nature that made the first Ant-Man offering such a blast is often lost around tiresome plot threads and uninteresting diversions while the whole science behind the gangs mission to find a way to bring Janet back isn't all that exciting, especially when compared to many of Marvel's recent cinematic offerings that found entertaining ways to tell intriguing and gripping comic book like storylines.With this effort, the Ant-Man series as a stand-alone offering appears to be in an interesting place and while highly unlikely that this will be the last of the Paul Rudd solo outings and perhaps just the beginnings of a Wasp standalone universe, it feels as though there's not a whole lot more for Ant-Man to give the Marvel movie universe as a solo player, more so a hopefully well used member of the larger universe where his unique charms and playful nature can shine in a more condensed version.Final Say -Not taking itself too seriously goes a long way to making Ant-Man and the Wasp is a sporadically fun piece of throwaway entertainment but this feels like a film trying a little too hard to make things work and a step-backwards from the surprisingly solid first outing, that seemed to suggests Scott Lang was set to be a new key player in the Marvel landscape, where he now feels like more of a bit player at best.2 ½ Pez dispensers out of 5"
337,7,"A fun MCU ride with low stakes is...refreshing? ""Ant-Man"" has always been that outlier in the MCU. Sure, ""Guardians of The Galaxy"" made a huge splash with a lot more goof and fun than doom and gloom, but Ant-Man really spoke to the every man. He just wanted to see his daughter. And Paul Rudd, just like Robert Downey Jr., is perfect in the role. Charismatic and hilarious, he drove the first movie on that alone. Now, with the sequel having been out a while, how did it stack up? And with a release close to Infinity War, what answers does it have?First off, it jumped the shark a bit. While a fun ride, ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" feels...weird in a way. It's refreshing to see a MCU movie with low stakes. And chuckled, giggled and smiled throughout the movie. But at the same time, that complacency and formulaeic plot hinders the movie from being anything BUT a fun and forgettable MCU entry.""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" picks up 2 years after ""Captain America: Civil War"". With the Sokovia accords in place, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, ""Ant-Man"", ""Captain America: Civil War"") has been sentanced to 2 years house arrest after the battle at the airport. Scott is just days away from finally being free when he has a weird dream. He's back in the Quantum Realm and sees a blurry vision of Janet Von Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer, ""Murder On The Orient Express"") the previous Wasp, who had been lost to the realm years prior. He immediately calls Hank Pym (Micheal Douglas, ""Ant-Man"", ""Basic Instinct""), who after the battle had to go on the run because of Scott using his suit, together with his daughter Hope Von Dyne (Evangeline Lilly, ""The Hobbit"" franchise). Scott realizes how weird his dream is and hangs up after leaving a voice mail.Shortly after, he gets knocked out only to be face to face with Hope. She tells him that his dream wasn't just a dream and that it could be the key to saving Janet. Together, they need to extract whatever information Scott has, while a mysterious figure nicknamed Ghost (real name ""Ava"", Hannah John-Kamen, ""Ready Player One"", ""Black Mirror"") is stalking them from the shadows, with her own agenda, all the while a black market tech dealer named Sonny Burch (Walton Goggings, ""Justified"") is trying to get ahold of Hank Pym's technology to sell to the highest bidder. Despite the monologue in the trailers, this is a very small scale movie, with mentions of the Sokovia accords and the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" serving as the reminder that this is indeed a MCU movie. It is also one of the most lighthearted movies in the franchise to date, with more jokes and quips than ever, which works against the movie in a few places.The biggest problem with ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" is the plot itself. When they teased Janet's possible survival at the end of ""Ant-Man"", I was intrigued but wanted it to remain what Hank kept working towards. Now with the whole plot centering around Hope, Hank and Janet, it feels like a wasted opportunity to have it as the unattainable goal for Hank (which would have been more compelling in my opinion). Nevertheless, Paul Rudd, as previously mentioned, steals the show and carries the film, with his best friend and partner in crime Luis (Micheal Peña, ""End of Watch"") coming in at a close second. And Micheal Douglas has more to do this time around (and more quips to throw too). The most disappointing of the cast is sadly the main antagonist, Hanna John-Kamen's Ava. While given a stereotypical but compelling backstory, there is very little good to say about Ghost/Ava in general. John-Kamen gives her all with what she had been given, but she feels out of place, like a wasted character sadly. Apart from her, the returning cast (the two other newcomers, Laurence Fishburne and Walton Goggings, do a fine job as well) are just as good as the first time around (T. I's Dave and David Dastmalchian's Kurt are criminally underused). Scott's daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) even has some cute and insightful conversations with her father about partnership and saving the world.The jokes are less fun this time around, making me chuckle instead of laugh, and some fall flat or are dragged out too long (one in particular towards the end of the film is excruciatingly cringeworthy) and the action scenes are a joy for the viewers, if lacking slightly in the effects department. The very entertaining, mindbending shrinking scenes using special lenses from the first movie are missing here, and it sticks out like a sore thumb. It's a bit disappointing, but not enough to subtract from the movie overall. What is enough, however, is the laughably obvious ""McGuffin"" padding to Janet's character. I will keep the spoilers light, but the finale and answer to Ava's predicament is just lazily written and executed. Which is a shame, because I was invested up until the reveal.With the release being close to Infinity War, are there any questions answered? Well, a few but I can't talk about them since it would completely spoil them. But they are there. Not bad but certainly not needed either. Overall, the movie is still refreshing. Low stakes, a fun and lighthearted tone, great cast, and pretty effects, ""Ant Man and The Wasp"" knows what it is and doesn't try too hard to be something more. Still, a little more effort writing the plot would've been welcomed. Is it great? No. Is it awful? No. Is it an entertaining, forgettable entry in the MCU? Yes and yes. But that doesn't make it a bad movie in itself. The actors seem to have fun and enjoy what they're doing. And I had fun too. So, it did its job. Not well, but decently enough."
338,5,"unfortunately, this not What I Expected !!?? The story was little boring and stupid, I must admit I fell to sleep in the first hour .the acting was ok but I think they tried to make this movie funny like (DEADPOOL) but they fail miserably , and speaking about the music !! omg !! it was so awful .so if you were bored and had nothing important to do and you want to kill some time, then , go watch it , but don't expect to see a great thing . in my opinion this movie deserve less than 7.2 .5/10"
339,5,"It worth 5, but not because of Hannah The story is very hip-hop like. Like the ant-figth. Hannah's null-mimic, the FBI agent's foulness and that constant extortion through the movie is horrible. Rudd's simple character could compensate a bit with its big-heart attitude. The reference at the end to Thano's solution to the problem of the galaxy is a bit unlikely, but believable. But Hannah John-Kamen's (so called) casting is horrible. It seems she graduated on the Hulk department of the Steven Segal's actor school."
340,6,"It delivered Ant-Man and the wasp did not dissapoint the story line happened during the avengers fighting with thanos, 70% of the movie they are trying to bring back the mother which was bad for the movie because they forgot the main story a little bit. The villian in this movie was not the best you kinda feel bad for the villian then the villian in the end turned good so in general the movie is not bad it had some great scenes and good acting especially from the new villian."
341,7,"Humor, Action, & Large Ants I liked this movie in terms of it's comedic side. The shrinking cars, and buildings are cleaver! I was not a fan of the large ants. The ending caught me by surprise! Looking forward to Avengers 4!"
342,1,"Stupid A** movie They are to busy doing face time,when they should be practical.I feel the script is written by a bunch of preschoolers.Than just fixed here and there,by the actors agents The story is boring,the characters lame and uninteresting. And you really don't care about any of them.Which is also the movies biggest problem. Not to mention the chemistry between the leads just isn't there. They may have been best friends off screen,but they can't make it on the big screenWhen the heroes,would be better of hiding in the suit,and wearing heir mask. They constantly take of their face mask,just to market their face.Which Is ludicrous,since everyone a side form Michael Douglas is B list. And When wasp would actually benefit from being small,they make her be humans size.Just so they can do close up on her face. Her Unmasked face. In almost every other scene , they demask and do close up.Not to mention that when she can stop the bad guys,she never actually does. She only do temporarily stuff so she can get away.and they can chase her. And make problem for her later"
343,7,Fantastic and hilarious. This is one of the best movie of marvels.great fun and story and good technology and amazing little creatures are shown in this movie. truly loved it and enjoyed it with family and yes that scene in the end when they vanish is truly shocking scene for the avengers infinity war..can't wait for part 3 and also for avengers 4 .
344,8,"Simple but great. I didn't expect this one to turn out a great movie. But yeah, it did. The plot is simple but visual effects still work. If the contents are better, it'd be better. But still, it's enjoyable."
345,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: On par sequel I love what Marvel have done in the creation of their ""Universe"" it's an overwhelming triumph and despite my fears they managed to slot Antman in there perfectly back in 2015.A heavily comedic character is was heavy on charm, humour and elevated by a fantastic charm. Truth be told I found myself really hyped for the second movie, more than any other (Except GotG).With every cast member both big and small returning a fantastic villian and the one and only Laurence Fishburne, the stars were aligning for another fantastic addition to the universe. And it is................kind of.Regarding the previous films I've enjoyed them all with the exception of two. I didn't see the appeal in Dr Strange and thought that Black Panther was one of the most overrated movies in the history of the industry.Antman 2 delivers, it does just not to the extent I hoped. Rudd, Lilly and Douglas are excellent once again and the story is fantastic though I think much of the impact of some of the story is highly lacking.Our new villian delivered more than I'd ever expected, Pfeiffer was a great addition and Pena managed to annoy me less than usual!The first movie got a solid 7/10 from me and this sequel is recieving the same. What that means is I consider it a good film, it's just not exactly groundbreaking stuff. I feel the movie played it a tad safe and didn't meet its potential.Regardless it's funny, it's action packed and it's likeable and therefore it's another Marvel success in my book.The Good:Incredible castGenuine laughsFits into the universe wellThe Bad:I still don't like PenaSome of the impact was lostBit genericThings I Learnt From This Movie:Lilly is a very clever actress who picks her roles wellSomeone still needs to explain to me how they do that age regression thing sfxWalton Goggins has friends in high placesThe size shifting has all kinds of bedroom possibilitiesTruth serum IS a thing"
346,7,Too Predictable It is enjoyable movie with great special effects but the story line is too predictable.
347,9,"Ant-Man and the Wasp The movie is good, fun and exciting. Tho the villian could have been better. Otherwise you must see it"
348,9,Very good I enjoyed every minute of it. Michael Peña gets lots of time to shine and the supporting cast proves as important as the main cast. This is a team movie. I've watched it 3 times already and may just watch it many more before it stops being enjoyable.
349,8,"I love how people think that the MCU has a standard Why is everyone so bent out of shape that a Marvel movie has some humor and good acting instead of being stacked with explosions, terrible CGI and non stop action. This movie was laugh out loud funny and only a good group of actors like this can pull off such a ridiculous concept like Ant-Man. I think it's just as good as the first one. I love the big action/small action sequences. I don't know how people hated this so much and compared it to the other Marvel movies as if they are any better. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one."
350,8,"Surprisingly enjoyable Ant-Man & The Wasp Review 3/5It's insane to think all of this started with Iron Man back in 2008 which by comparison is more grounded and realistic. Now we have a hulk, talking raccoons, gods, witches, walking trees, giant men/tiny men, giant ants, aliens, robots and wizards. But it's based off comics so all of this crazy surreal stuff is normal. The great thing about the MCU is all of these crazy characters are set within our world and they manage to make it work so well (even if some of them go overboard with the comedy).Two years after the events of Civil War, the Sokovian Accords have made it difficult for superheroes to operate and our characters once again have to go rogue. With just three days left on his house arrest Scott Lang is approached by Hope to help bring her mother back from the quantum realm.It's complicated to explain but if you have seen the previous film you'll know that the quantum realm is a very microscopic place she has been trapped in for thirty years. Anyway scientist Hank Pym has made his own device to extract her but he needs a final piece to finish it. They have to buy it from an arms dealer played by Walton Goggins and naturally things go awry. It becomes a chase thriller where our characters are constantly being pursued.Ant-Man & The Wasp takes it to even more ridiculous outlandish levels. All of this shrinking/enlarging technology is quite implausible but at the same time amusing - There are giant ant assistants, Hank Pym has a collection of cars which he can enlarge to regular sized cars and their lab can shrink and turn into a pull along case.The action scenes are so entertaining and with all the size changing mumbo jumbo it just makes them more visually engrossing. It's not as intense as Civil War or Infinity War but with its lighthearted tone and some comedic moments it's in the same league as Guardians of the Galaxy.With various story arcs and characters the plot gets a little thin from time to time as it relies on exposition to push the story forward - ""Do you guys just put the word 'quantum' in front of everything"" utters Paul Rudd, and it's the self deprecating humour like this that makes all this exposition almost forgivable.It also requires you to have seen both Ant-Man and Civil War as it references those storylines quite a lot. If you haven't already seen those films I really recommend them, I recommend all of the MCU films (except Thor The Dark World and Incredible Hulk).Ghost is an interesting character with a good backstory, she just wants to save herself from dying but she sometimes goes to extreme measures to get what she wants. However she doesn't really get much focus because of other characters like Walton Goggins' character who is just there purely for no other reason other than to pursue our protagonists.It's one of the least memorable of the series because it mimics a lot from the first film and requires you to be upto date with the films, it doesn't really stand well as it's own film because it gets too concerned referencing the others. But if you can see past the flaws it's a wildly entertaining chapter to the MCU franchise with some great special effects, action and humour that even pokes fun at the previous films. Oh and the de-ageing effects used to make some actors look younger look flawless."
351,9,"Fantastic This film had lots of humor, heartfelt moments, and action! The triple threat in my opinion. Absolutely loved this second installment of Ant Man! Marvel can do no wrong."
352,10,Regret reading bad reviews first I am usually very picky when it comes to movies. I read the bad reviews before the good ones and decide should I watch the movie or not. But this time I was totally wrong. This movie is much better than the original Ant Man movie. I don't remember when was the last time I had such a good laugh watching a movie. Although this is not a comedy movie its funny and hilarious. I didn't notice time from the start till the end. An hour a half gone so quick. Many of those laughs comes from the silly looking sci fi plot. Even the serious looking Professor Pym made me laugh. Too much science fiction combined with jargons sometimes turn out to be good comedy. With that said its not that silly plot the actual idea of quantum shrinking and stuff was very interesting. A good movie after a while. I am glad I watched it.
353,6,"Good CGI The CGI carries this story. The acting was humorously passable. A bit too formula, but what else is there to do in super hero movies that hasn't been done countless times before. Evil vs. good; car chases; kick-ass martial arts. On the positive side are guest appearances by Tardigrades which are the true super heroes of all living things. On the negative side is more dumbing down science such as taking advantage of pop interest in quantum anything (with lots of meaningless associated terminology tossed in to make it all passable) though as depicted it was utterly utter nonsense. Fantasy doesn't have to dumb us down. Even middle schooler science students would know that if you shrink/decrease the volume the mass isn't going away so good luck dealing w/that problem."
354,7,"fun, inconsequential action comedy Less stupid than the original Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun little comedy with some action here and there. It's breezy and fun, and if the story is occasionally janky and the number of antagonists large and messy, it still all holds together reasonably well if you don't think about the, let's call it ""science.""Both Ant-Man movies were directed by Peyton Reed, who has directed a lot of comedies, and I was surprised by how weak the humor in the first movie was. This time Reed shows his comedy chops, and the movie has a heavy focus on comedy, much of it successful.The strongest part of the movie is the action-packed final quarter. It was almost enough to get me to rate this an 8, but I'll stick with 7."
355,7,"Humorous and Original With a delightfully humorous and original approach to the source material in this second outing, #Antmanandthewasp proves to be a welcoming palate cleanser for the increasingly homogenous pack of titles in the MCU -- and at the same time shows that sometimes smaller IS better."
356,2,"Fell Short I actually liked the first Ant Man. I was going into this movie expecting some good action sequences, humor and mostly to be entertained. I have to say I was disappointed on all levels with this film. First of all the acting and story plot were very underwhelming. Most T.V. action shows had better acting, chemistry and story telling. Maybe, too much blue screen? There were some actual good action scenes, but most were so ridiculous looking I was shaking my head. The special effects were good at times and then extremely bad at times. Did they forget to edit this movie? The main villain in this movie was not well developed and poorly acted by the actress and most of all the other actors couldn't act and didn't seem to fit their parts.. The more known actors and guest stars ( Michael Douglas, Laurence Fishburne, and Michelle Pfeiffer), were all were very underwhelming in their performances. Definitely, no oscars in this movie. The humor in this movie was very predictable and fell flat. I found most humor in just how ridiculous this movie looked and was edited. Poor film with terrible acting, one liners, predictable plot and humor and forgettable villain. I give it 2 1/ 2 but could have been lower with out a decent performance from Paul Rudd and his relationship with his daughter which was a strong point in this movie. I never gave less than 3 stars for an MCU movie. I have to blame it on the director on this one. MCU, you can do better!"
357,6,"Light, fun, and easy to follow I watched this with out watching the original or reading the comics, so I didn't that much about the back story or characters. It didn't really matter all that much though, because it doesn't rely to heavily on other stories. The plot isn't overly complicated, and doesn't try to be some 'it's going to be the end of the world if you don't do this in a certain amount of time' movie. At its core, it is about finding and re-connecting with the loves ones you haven't been with in a long, long time. It's sweet, and funny, and a toned down family film. The action scenes are pretty exiting, with things growing and shrinking, and other things disappearing and appearing. It does pale in comparison to other better, more sophisticated marvel movies, due to its familiarity and no long term lasting impact."
358,4,"Wow, high ratings NOT AT ALL justified The movie is weak, story is basically infantile, even for a sci-fi. Acting borders sledding downhill in a shovel, towards a busy street. Jokes are abysmal and not funny. Action is transparent, weak and unconvincing. I REGRET paying for seeing it on iTunes! The best part of the movie are trailers, but, those are free. Therefore, choose wisely, grasshopper."
359,8,Suitable sequel This is a good sequel to tie up the last movies where Ant Man had taken part in including the Avengers and Ant Man part 1. We had to find out the story behind Hope's mother so its good that they told it and work that into the sequel since it was mentioned in part 1. Its as entertaining as the first one.
360,6,"An enjoyable but unsatisfying action flick that pales to more recent films of the genre. This isn't bad but it ain't great either. Action movies have been having a successful few years and the genre has upped its game when it comes to combining action with humor. This movie holds much potential but alas, mostly unrealized as it has neither the laughs nor the story to challenge the best of these movies. Perhaps it's because Paul Rudd's shtick is becoming predictable and repetitive. He needs a female counterpoint to keep the dialog snappy and keep our attention. Evangeline Lilly proves to be just a face, without the compelling screen magic to elevate the script and keep us glued to the screen. The rest of the cast saves the movie, especially Michael Peña, Hannah John-Kamen and the ever-reliable Laurence Fishburne."
361,3,"Best for ages 5-15 This was a rental sale so I rented it for $2.99 and felt I would rather have kept the money. Having enjoyed the original enough to watch it twice I had somewhat high expectations but really just wanted some fun entertainment.As for the glowing reviews: Are they being paid by Disney?To be honest, after the first 40 minutes it was so excruciating that I fast forwarded to the middle but after 15 more minutes the pain didn't abate so I moved forward to the last 30 min.Due to my limited screening I won't comment on the (likely numerous) plot holes but will just stick to the tone. I did chuckle once but mostly grimaced at the attempt at humor.The intro scene with the daughter was amusing and original enough and then it just collapsed into mediocrity.The characters seem like caricatures and the attempt at levity doesn't mitigate the stiff acting with Michael Peña offering the best portrayal followed by Paul Rudd.Plenty of high action and quality CGI, if that's what you're looking for."
362,9,"Good and fun to watch Didn't like Paul Rudd actualy that much, but since AntMan I'm starting to see what he can do. Can put humor into his role. Good sequel, story line was good, perfect next chapter. Great special effects, cool moves.. yup overall a very good movie, fun to watch."
363,7,"""Do you guys just put the word 'quantum' in front of everything?"" It's ironic how a movie can be so entertaining and ridiculous at the same time. It's kind of curious to me how no one in the general public in this story would take notice of a huge building springing up or disappearing at the drop of a hat. How would you explain that? This film is probably a bit more sci-fi than comic book super-hero, what with all the quantum entanglement between quantum states going on. A lot of it is difficult to follow, and maybe we're not supposed to follow it, because a lot of it is as ridiculous as my building analogy. But the action is slick and the special effects add to the credibility of a sub-atomic world lurking around in the vast recesses of time and space.Once again, a shout out to Stan Lee, creator of Ant-Man and a host of Marvel comic characters, with his cameo in the latter third of the picture as an old man about to get into his car which is miniaturized by one of the shrinking gizmos. He had a cool reaction - ""Well, the Sixties were fun, but now I'm paying for it!"" I also got a kick out of the drive-in movie feature near the end with Scott (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) enjoying a clip from 1954's ""Them"", about giant mutant ants threatening civilization.Last but not least you had the clip during the closing credits that sets up another Ant-Man sequel as Scott gets stranded in the sub-atomic world while Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hope get caught up in the aftermath of Infinity War. You can take it on faith that everything will turn out just fine."
364,10,raised the bar In a word 'AWESOME' ************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
365,10,Great Action Film with a touch of comedy Really impressed with the movie. Just what we needed after Infinity War. Post credit scene was a real cliffhanger.
366,6,"A repetitive Sci-Fi that offers little to add to the traditional making A regular Sci-Fi movie with visual effects and burst of technological know-hows. This was meant to perform well after the 1st part failed to deliver the quality expected of a Marvel movie. But, unfortunately this successfully repeated the regular Sci-Fi stuff. A burst of technological terms and effects gives little to delve into the story. The comic part was average. An interesting part at the end was the connecting pin offered with the Marvel universe. The turning into dust effects them too leaving Ant-Man into quantum reality. Does he have a chance to change the unfateful state of affairs of Infinity war? This is a mystery to solve."
367,4,"Slooooooooooooooow A race between molasses and a group of crying tortoises has more action than this movie. Anyway, the bond between Ant-man and his daughter is very adorable. I really don't understand why the FBI agent is made out to be more confused than Scooby-Doo....but whatever I put on this movie on while sleeping."
368,4,"Too bad Scott is stuck in the quantum realm First half is completely boring, second half got some action but still failed to do the job as a superhero movie. No villan in the movie so the job of hero is also not there. In the name of villan... just a desperate girl who is trying to survive and cure her disease. There is no story on AntMan at all. The movie is a love story and revolves around an old scientist couple who got reunited in the end with technology."
369,7,"Somewhere between ""Meh"" and ""Ugh"" I feel like the people in charge have really stepped up their game over the last couple of years and that the MCU movies are better than ever. I absolutely loved Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming (I'm saving Black Panther for a rainy/snowy day when I really need a new superhero movie). For me, Avengers: Infinity War was bold and brave and perfectly executed; there was a vision for it 10 years ago and the powers that be followed through on their commitment and did what the average movie goer never expected them to do with many of their characters. Ant-Man and the Wasp had zero impact on the events of Infinity War in the same way that Black Panther avoided the issue of the Infinity Gems, and not having seen Black Panther I can't say if it suffers from the same, but with this movie it just feels like a too obvious sidestep. Knowing what we know going in it's hard to be sucked in to caring about the events contained in Ant-Man and the Wasp, because we know that ultimately it is all inconsequential. The only thing that saves this movie is the Morrissey reference and Scott's ringtone. Although Morrissey himself doesn't care for the nickname ""Moz"", it's very important that our children learn about him. There is an entire gneration of sullen, eternally sad kids that might not realize there is a voice out there that speaks to them, understands what their going through and cares about them. They're so used to listening to music DJ's constantly play that says nothing to them about their lives, and I think it's wonderful that someone took the time to them to tell those unhappy kids and teens that they are human and people understand that they deserve to be loved just like everybody else does."
370,7,"Good, fun entertainment. Solid follow up Ant-man and the wasp gave me exactly what I came for, entertainment. Fun, not too heavy and just entertaining to watch. Enjoyable characters, a few new additions and a post credit scene to tie it together. I honestly didn't expect to be blown away and I wasn't, but I still, really enjoyed the movie. PS Michelle Pfeiffer still looks amazing!"
371,4,"Kids movie Your time is more valuable, watch something else. Your time is more valuable, watch something else. Your time is more valuable, watch something else. Your time is more valuable, watch something else."
372,5,"Honey, I shrunk your brains This movie has absolutely no respect for the basic laws of physics or science. This is just a cartoon with real people and if they happened to include a cartoon version of Bugs Bunny or the Roadrunner it would probably be more serious. Hank Pym has quiet literally solved the problem of world hunger and the all our limited resources, but instead of using that technology for the good of humanity he's using it to play superheroes. Just saying... The rules in this movie are always changing and inconsistent. I can't make sense of it. In the first movie, they say that the mass of an object remains after shrinking, yet in this movie Hank is able to move buildings like toys after he's shrunk them. He's able to turn an ant into the size of cow and there's no problem but when he turns into a giant he needs a bunch of Z's to make up the ""energy wasted"". I somehow think and believe that Ant-Man is going to use some silly time travel ploy to undo Thanos damage."
373,7,"it's ok! It's entertaining but not meet the expectation. simple plot, simple type superhero..... overall good!"
374,8,"Two is better than one And I don't mean the sequel is better than the original. No you have the Wasp here (it's in the title) coming and aiding our Ant Man. I still like the first one better, but that does not take anything away from the sequel. Now since I've seen all the MCU movies, it's tough to say how someone who is not up to date will feel about this.Don't get me wrong, I think it works even without having seen the first one, let alone all the other movies. If you don't mind superhero movies, I don't have to sell this to you. I know that some have a sort of fatigue when it comes to them. After over a decade of very succesful making of an Universe (Marvel Cinematic Universe that is) that is not really that surprising. Especially because others try this out. And not just DC with their crossovers, but also the classic Monster crossover that almost happened (or maybe will happen, The Mummy was not succesful enough I reckon) and the Conjuring universe, with Annabelle and the Nun, right now.This is a ""in the meantime"", while Avengers Infinity War was going on. I for one can't wait for the next one ... Fun, light and of course with some holes, but always makng fun of itself too (the Quantum thing for example)"
375,10,A Underrated Movie with Wondrous Experience Well I liked it. It was hilarious in some parts while heart aching in others.It was enjoyable and I think that it is underrated compared to Marvel's other films.
376,8,"Funny, fast moving, and good special effect There is no boring moment in this movie. And it is funny in many ways.If you wonder why Antman was not in infinite war because the antman has to be in other movie.Marvel Comic is about continuation of all previous movies. This movie offers fun, fast moving, and good special effect. Forget about asking why things can change big or small. Forget the logic behind it. Just watch this movie.... you will love it"
377,7,"A good sequel... ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is another Marvel movie in which we watch Scott Lang / Ant-Man trying to balance his superhero life with being a father. The main topic of this movie is their new mission which is to uncover secrets from their past. In order to succeed on it, Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym will need the assistance of Scott Lang.I liked this movie because it combined very well action scenes and good CGI's with the adventurous part of it. I also enjoyed the fact that it explained to us why Scott Lang / Ant-Man was not in the last Avenger movie and showed the reason from his perspective. The interpretations of Paul Rudd (Scott Lang / Ant-Man), Evangeline Lilly (Hope Van Dyne / Wasp) and Michael Douglas (Dr. Hank Pym) were absolutely outstanding. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Laurence Fishburne's who played as Dr. Bill Foster and Michael Peña who played as Luis and once more he was hilarious. Peyton Reed did a very good job in the direction of this movie as he did in the first Ant-Man movie.Finally, I believe that ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is a good sequel and it will give you some new information about Marvel Universe and the role of Ant-Man on it. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much and you will have a lot of fun."
378,5,"Just to keep you busy.. Didn't feel invested at all in this movie. I love Paul Rudd, he's great. There were a couple of really funny moments. But the story fell flat. Emotionally I didn't care at all. This really brings a new meaning to marvels popcorn movies. A cheap formula that keeps you ""entertained"" for the movie length but you don't really want to see it again. Great background noise. It's nice.I wanted to love it. I hate disliking movies with great potential. Soundtrack was repetitive af... I know I sound bitter. But this movie was boring."
379,8,"I don't understand the hate for this movie I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and i absolutely enjoyed it so did most of the movie critics who gave positive feedback. The story is good, the action scenes are amazing and it also has a few funny moments. IGNORE THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK if you loved the first Ant-man movie because you will also love this sequel. I'm so glad to hear that Ant-Man will be in the Avengers 4 movie because i think it is good to have unusual types of hero's in the movie such as Ant-Man in the movie rather than having hero's that are all basically the same."
380,5,"Had some laughs, some action, but not great. To keep it short and sweet, better than Thor 1, not as good as Iron Man 3. Not a great Marvel movie overall. I watched this strictly to keep up with the overall Marvel storyline, which it had little to do with. If you watch throughout the credits (as Marvel fans know to do) you'll see why. I enjoyed some action scenes and it had some funny moments, but it was pretty weak overall. My rating of 5 is pretty generous."
381,8,"Probably the best Marvel movie Usually I don't like Marvel. And after a while stopped to watch anything Marvel. So my assumption about that this one is probably the best can be wrong, because I haven't watched much of Marvel. Marvel movies are usually very pathetic and dumb. Like ultra dumb. The Ant Man and The Wasp stay away from this because it is comedy. And doesn't have to deal with all that ""serious"" things. What I especially like is that every character in this movie has a clear motivation and they are all working together for the whole plot. It's really well thought out. And it has a lot of characters. It's a great action comedy for any age."
382,3,"This movie could've been good. I feel like this movie could've been 100 times better - Edgar Wright I wish that's something he'd say. This movie didn't feel like a movie. It was a filler for something they'll introduce in Avengers 4. Nothing stands out in this. Nothing relatable. Nothing noticeable. Nothing cool. The movie only has one dimensional action and characters. I could've thought of these action scenes in the comics I made when I was 9. And to go with it, the dialogue I made when I was 9 too. Just so cringy and choppy. Also the ""We must save ___."" It's a basic plot from 101 academy. And it's Wasp as the main hero. Who cares about this Antman fellow? Nah, it's the Wasp. With her basic action scenes! To save someone! Who would've ever thought of this original idea!? I like movies even if they have such overused plots only if they do it different. This says no. Even with the effort looking like it was none in this movie. I feel the aura inside me that this movie probably did have effort in it. In some interviews, the director sounded like he was invested in this Antman and Wasp story. I saw the movie, and I knew this guy tried to style his movie. Like he tried to so hard to be a god at directing like Edgar Wright. That did not work. When scenes in movies just try to so hard to be cool, it's cheesy and cringy. That's what this turned out to be. A cheesy thing. Cheesy action, dialogue like I said before. This shouldn't have been made until there was an actual good storyline for these two characters."
383,7,"'Ant-Man' continues its run as Marvel's smart change of pace If you're sick and tired of all the Marvel movies, who could blame you? The formula is abundantly clear by now, and the pace of 2-3 films a year is exhausting. Yet the Marvel Cinematic Universe is so smartly realized that it even has its own antidote-the ""Ant-Man"" series.Every Marvel movie has a sense of humor, but ""Ant-Man"" is that humor at its broadest. Paul Rudd's choice to play Scott Lang as ""the superhero who is just happy to be a superhero"" works delightfully better than it ought to, and director Peyton Reed has found ways to let Rudd's energy trickle to the rest of the cast and other elements of both productions-2015's ""Ant-Man"" and now ""Ant-Man and the Wasp.""The creative choice behind these films has painted Ant-Man as the black sheep of the MCU, making this sequel the perfect follow-up to the devastatingly self-serious ""Avengers: Infinity War."" The investment level is much lower for this movie and its ambitions ant-sized in comparison. Too some extent, it might even be too light and breezy.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" sees Lang under house arrest following his excursion to Germany during ""Civil War,"" but he's soon plucked out of it by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) when the two realize that Lang's time in the Quantum Realm in the last film might be the key to allow them to locate Pym's wife/Hope's mother, Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who was lost in the realm decades earlier.Although the trio finds its plans in jeopardy due to some competing interests, the plot being a voluntary mission takes a lot of the stakes out of the film. We have no attachment to Janet Van Dyne, even if we can empathize for why Pym and Hope would want to find and rescue her. And given finding her requires a machine built inside of a size-changing MacGuffin that runs on suspension of disbelief, the script requires some artifice to stay interesting.In other words, the story that the joyride of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is built upon (which saw contributions from two writing duos plus Rudd) isn't all that solid or interesting, which doesn't derail the viewing experience so much as generate indifference. The fun to be had lies mostly with the size-changing gimmick, which continues to be smartly deployed as it was in the original ""Ant-Man."" The heist conceit that powered that film, however, gave it more of a foundation and a focus that this movie is missing.So the relaxed attitude of the film is both a strength and a limitation. The strong group of main characters, bolstered by Lilly's expanded role (even if she feels an awful lot like Black Widow), keeps it engaging, though the fun, humor and creativity seems to have an obvious ceiling. That's a shame, because Ant-Man feels like a character with a lot more potential than a light change of pace.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
384,9,Ant man is back and he is with wasp I enjoyed it. Its a stand alone Marvel film. Just shows you they dont need Cap or the avengers to support this film. Wasp is good in this aswell. So ant man gets a suit goes small and big. Wasp helps him and Hank is still smart old Hank. Good jokes also.
385,9,"Awesome and the wasp This is maybe the greatest solo marvel movie ever made! It is a good humoured family film with everything in it. The action in it is exciting, it's really funny without being over the top. Every joke hits its mark. Paul Rudd captures the essence of the character, as does most actors in this flick. Thoroughly enjoyed it, don't let the ant Man haters put you off watching it! 'thats that truth syrum bro'"
386,6,"The third Marvel movie in a row to make me root for the villain What makes Spider-Man, Captain America, heck even Iron Man and Batman who they are? If you ask me, it's an interest in helping others. Is the execution always perfect? No. Is helping others always their number one priority over fixing their own problems? Well.. No, not really. But at least it's still somewhere in the back of their heads.Is Ant-Man supposed to be an Antihero? I don't think so. So is he supposed to be a hero then? My answer would be ""I guess?"" Or has the Marvel Cinematic universe made way for JUST superpowered guys, with no incentive of going against the greater good or for it?Over the years Marvel Disney has created blockbuster upon blockbuster and I for one have been a huge fan since I found out about the first Iron-Man movie. Now, I am not a comics reader myself but ever since the cartoons in the 90s I have been hooked to everything Marvel. The MCU has brought so many great movies, and yes, a lot of flaws have to be overlooked if you want to be able to call the protagonists of said movies 'superheroes', or 'heroes'... or even 'the good guys'. But these last couple MCU movies are pushing it a bit too far for my taste.BLACK PANTHER RANT Marvel's Black Panther was a movie about a country which had both superior technology and materials compared to the rest of the world and were too greedy to share it with anyone. Cue the 'bad guy' who wants Wakanda to share their knowledge. Obviously, this guy was right, no person or country should think they are God and keep knowledge for themselves.INFINITY WAR RANT Next up: Avengers Infinity War. Thanos is the protagonist of the universe in my opinion. Were his ways a bit wicked at first? Yes. Did he murder millions and millions of organisms? Supposedly. Did he kill enough? As a matter of fact, no, I don't think so. Thanos saw that living beings are destroying the universe and the only way to postpone said destruction, was by eradicating half of them and therefore slowing down the inevitable end. Since population growth is exponential however, taking away 50% of the population will probably not be enough (it took us 46 years to double from 3.7 to 7.4 billion humans). Anyway, I digress.BACK TO ANT-MAN & THE WASP Ant-Man and the Wasp has a likable 'bad guy', Ghost. She has had a miserable childhood and is trying to find a way to stop being in physical agony every second of her life (small note: is she constantly in pain? She doesn't seem to be hurting but that could just be me) on top of being a mental train wreck. Yes, she could have just gone to the person most likely able to help her and ask politely, but she decided to take the rogue path. I guess, after seeing him as the villain for all your life, you don't expect he will be the person worth reasoning with. After finding out about her, her pain and that they can probably help her, Hank and the gang decide to basically say ""Well, your problem isn't as big as ours, we just figured out that maybe we can get someone dear to us back who we thought had died yeaarrsss ago."" Hopefully, they were thinking that after that, if they felt like it, they might look into her case. But this is unfortunately never said. And luckily enough, miracles apparently come around to save the girl. Good going guys.What makes this movie way worse than the other two movies I mentioned, is that it lacks ambition. Now as I said, I never read the comics and I don't know if this is simply staying true to those. But for example, a girl with quantum phasing as an ability and the only gimmicky power she has is going through objects? What about being in several places at the same time, entanglement with her other selves, even a joke about being alive and dead at the same time would have been nice. The sleezy bad guy salesman has no added value if you ask me. I actually kind of forgot that he was in the movie until I read about him somewhere else. What was he doing? Was he comic relief? Was his reason to go after the lab, because he thought they were making some quantum computer, like he said when we first met him? If so, why did he not get scared when he saw people, cars and building shrinking and growing all the time and figure out that they were in a business that he should not want to have anything to do with?In conclusion, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a movie about a dumb guy who doesn't care about others. Oh wait Hank too, oh and the sleezy guy. And Hope too I guess. So it's about three guys and a girl who don't care about others and just want to help themselves while others are quite obviously in more need of help.Please, Thanos almighty, let Captain Marvel be good again."
387,7,"Overall a good movie Its a good movie, not the greatest super hero movie, but does the job, has an interesting history, a litle bit predictable ending but enjoyable. Would reccomend."
388,7,"Better than first part! Actually better than part one , and at the end you will find something about Avengers"
389,6,"Team or partner New technolgy are included. I like this movie. I like the transformation of small to big and vice-versa. I love the stunts,fight etc. Overall, the partnership of scott and hope worked"
390,8,"still kinda fun Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has three more days of house arrest after the events of Civil War and is working with Luis (Michael Peña) in a struggling security start-up. His mind is connected to Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) since his excursion into the quantum realm. Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) are hiding from the Feds and need Scott's mind to locate Janet. They get into conflicts with underworld dealer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) and the mysterious Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). Hank reluctantly reaches out to former partner Dr. Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne).First of all, I like these characters. That's half the battle in this type of movie. I care about them and therefore, I care about their adventures. The villains are fine although Ghost's story should be presented first instead of a nothing scene with young Pfeiffer. The villains are often the least developed in these MCU movies. As for Pfeiffer, she doesn't need to appear until the climax. This is generally fun with a comedic Rudd at the helm. It's a little below the first movie but it's still a joy."
391,10,"Do not get the negative reviews. Very enjoyable movie, if you liked Thor ragnarock you will definitely like this movie, the only weak aspect was the baddies, but it was nothing major. a real fun time , one of the better mavel movies."
392,3,"It is a comedy This movie is one I will only watch once. As one reviewer here posted, this movie has no depth to it. Almost the entire movie is full of jokes. Visual effects were very good. But the storyline was boring and disappointing. Definitely not of the caliber and at par with other of the recent MARVEL movies."
393,8,"A nice ride! Great actors, nice special effects will keep your interest for the whole movie.Highly recommended for all the Avengers fans."
394,9,"Better than the first Beetter than the first, This ones alot funnier, the story is pretty good and Rudd is a great actor, definitely watch it again."
395,1,"What a truly awful film in very conceivable way! How and why I sat through that, I wish I knew.Go and do anything, rather than watch it.Life is too short to throw away 2 hours of it you'll never get back."
396,8,"Chill vibe This is a less intense, more fun superhero movie. It's pretty good - not the best of all of the Marvel movies, but a very welcome addition. The bad guys aren't that bad, the stakes aren't world-ending. And the ending is maybe the best of all of these movies."
397,6,It was a comedy. The number of people who didn't realize that this was a comedy is frightening. I understand not liking the jokes. But complaining that the script was too jokey makes me do a double take.
398,6,"It's a marvel movie Not much more too say it's decent with a good script and funny dialogue but a weak villain and poor action scenes, still, an enjoyable instalment that cleanses the pallet after infinity war"
399,8,Pretty fun!!! This movie is hilarious and very fun! The ending is a little weak but overall it's a good movie!
400,10,"Amazing Movie! This movie is one of the best marvel (Stories) and movies ever, and for my opinion it is even better than Ant-man part one, never expected to be so exciting with new great potentials and capabilities and new material factors rather than part one, great job."
401,6,Sticks to the same formula as the first but falls flat The first movie was a pleasant surprise and this tried following the same formula but was lacked the originality of the first movie. The main villain in this movie had a cool character design but did not carry the necessary weight and danger of an antagonist. Evangeline lily did a convincing job in her role as well as Michael Douglas but the story was a crutch of the film.
402,8,A good marvel film that's not too serious With all the politics from black panther and sadness from infinity war comes antman and the wasp a film that you can just switch off and enjoy. I wasn't expecting much beforehand but this film was better than I thought it would be. If you want a Sunday film to just chill with the family then this is it.
403,1,"I desperately wanted to enjoy this. Watching this was painful. I enjoyed other MCU movies (even Thor 2 and Age of Ultron.. yeah, I got low standards). But even I can say that this is garbage. I was able to suspend my disbelief in other movies (no matter how bad they were). But in this, I couldn't stop thinking about the flaws with the concept of Ant-man. There are too many issues.1) Weight issues: I couldn't understand how their weight keeps on changing. I mean, would they be lighter when they get small? They were able to carry the building, so yes. But if so, how are they able to kick or punch while being so small?2) Boundaries issue: I thought that the suit provided a boundary within which everything gets shrunk. But no, that does not seem to be the case. How do they define the space within which they can shrink? When Wasp shrinks Ant-man, his clothes got shrunk but not his ankle bracelet? How?3) Strength issues: Do the objects which get shrunk keep their strength? When the Van got de-shrunk under a car, the van just lifted and threw the car above without any damage to itself.4) Breathing issues: The mom-wasp and pops-antman take off their helmets at the quantum level. But how are they getting oxygen? They should be dead.5) Search issues: Mom-wasp go lost in quantum realm of a missile. They would need to get the missile to start searching within it. How did they find her somewhere else? Was she floating in the quantum realm?6) Speed issues: When the cars were shrunk they still maintained the same speed; How?7) Ghost issues: The ghost girl was shown as not being able to control her phasing problem. But her clothes stay on, she sits on the bed without going through it, she walks on the ground; but how?8) Stupidity issues: The villain, who does all his research on his targets, doesn't have the decency to hide when he was trying to escape on the boat?Ok.. I guess I'm entering the nitpick realm. I'll stop now. But it's a miracle how this garbage got this high rating; hell the comedy wasn't good, not one laugh (okay, they guy explaining the flash back in his voice was good). I did not want to hate on this, but if you don't criticize the bad, you will keep on getting the bad."
404,1,"Snooze This movie was not good at all. Seems like it was put together to try to hold us off for the next Marvel movie. The storyline was weak and the script is awful, my kids laughed bc well that's the level of humor it was."
405,2,"Boring, Empty, More Boring I delayed watching this movie for like a week or so, thinking that it was a masterpiece and one should watch it when in a perfect mood. So I watched it today. 10 minutes goes by, and there is almost nothing. 20 minutes, still nothing. About an hour, and the things I saw in the trailer are the only interesting images that I got so far. An emptiness after emptiness, absurdity after another, and the boring level keeps accumulating... Shortly put, this movie is painfully boring, extremely boring and .. perfectly boring. 2/10 and bye bye for ever."
406,8,"Genial Buena trama, me gusta el guión!!! Superó mis expectativas"
407,6,"Looks like a superhero movie, but feels like a chickflick Neill D. Hicks ranks movie genres along a continuum, based upon the stakes - what is at risk for the protagonist. Near one end are chick-flicks, where the protagonist is simply trying to get on with their life, following a divorce, the loss of a loved one, a disease or amputation, etc. The stakes are paramount for the individual, but don't amount to a hill of beans for anybody else, beyond a very small group of intimates. The stakes become increasingly larger for rom-coms, road trips, heists, police procedurals and war films. Superhero and adventure films fall near the opposite end of the continuum, where the stakes are the survival of mankind or a significant portion of the population.Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) looks like a superhero film, but feels like a chick flick. It has a lot of fights, car chases, cool visuals, big machines and scientists with unconventional views. And yet, the stakes are quite modest - of critical importance to six or eight people, but of little concern to seven billion others. Scaling down the stakes is not entirely bad, as recent Marvel films and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 elevated the stakes to absurd cosmic levels. But the stakes in Ant-Man and the Wasp feel too trivial, more suited to a Lifetime TVM. Both chick flicks and action films use child characters to add warmth, but action films also often use them as victims to increase tension. A-MatW has two cute, precocious children, but neither is ever in any real danger.It has a lot of good elements. The humor is great. Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas play well off of each other. Michael Peña, Walton Goggins and Randall Park are amusing. The visual effects are stunning. The action is sufficiently fast-paced. Cinematography is good, with a refreshing absence of jiggly-cam shots. Performances are good. Special effects are top-notch.However, the science is ridiculous. At one point a character asks if several scientists simply put ""quantum"" in front of every term they use. The plot is pleasingly Byzantine on one level, but absurd on another and probably requires vivid recall of Ant-Man and Captain America: Civil War, as well as familiarity with the Ant-Man comics and Marvel universe to fully appreciate. The denouement strays into science fiction territory.It's a fun movie to watch, if one doesn't stop to think; however, it isn't entirely satisfying. Hong Kong films, such as Kung Fu Hustle, and some Bollywood films successfully merge elements of disparate genres into films that are satisfying on multiple levels. Ant-Man and the Wasp offers disparate elements that are effective individually, but don't quite coalesce into a satisfying whole."
408,5,"Not Bad A good time pass movie.It's not fair to rate this movie 1-star or 2-stars, and please do not exaggerate in your ratings to give it 8 or 9 or 10 stars"
409,6,"Hiya, champ, how was school today? The original Ant-Man was light and airy: Marvel popcorn. The hero rose from the ashes of being fired from Baskin-Robbins, not from a tragic origin story involving the loss of both parents and/or mentor. It was a gulp of micro-sized fresh air in-between the various scuffles of the wider cinematic universe that had the potential to end in planetary devastation. But the latter would catch up with the franchise sooner or later. The prologue of the sequel sets the tone for this adventure, to search for the long lost Janet van Dyne, wandering somewhere in the quantum realm. Likewise, Scott Lang's story begins near the end of his house arrest, a sentence earned from his gigantic cameo in Civil War.What really was his motivation for fighting on Captain America's side, anyway? One of the most egregious errors of the finale to the Cap trilogy was to mar what could have been an intriguing political conflict with how superheroes usually solve their problems: punches, kicks and laserbeams. What's worse was dragging in characters that had absolutely no business being that invested in the whole affair. T'Challa was fighting to avenge his father. What was Scott fighting for, a bit a fresh air and fun after getting itchy feet from playing his drum kit for the hundredth time?So while the first chapter in Scott's story had the benefit of playing out before all the universal threats in Marvel starting throwing things at each other, the sequel can't plead the same ignorance. Yet it continues to chug along as if it was completely removed from the rest of cinematic universe, as if the apocalyptic mood of the Avengers storyline dissipates as soon as it reaches the sunny beachfronts of San Francisco. No scene better exemplifies this than when Randall Park (perpetually stuck in sitcom mode) squats down next to Scott's daughter and gives an explanation of her father's criminal charges that is essentially baby talk. You might as well be erasing the lasting significance of Civil War altogether (not that the other movies don't do a good enough job of that anyway).Sure, it's funny in small doses, but the humour isn't unlike that of the rest of the Marvel cast anyway, all quipping in the same wisecracking, inoffensive tone of voice. In the Ant-Man franchise it's especially watered down, free of grim consequence; we're here to have fun, remember? This is the fun one. But Feige and Peyton Reed want to have their cake and eat it too. The charm of the original now has to squeeze itself into the MCU's bigger picture, but it's not that type of movie, and Paul Rudd doesn't have that kind of leading man gravitas. That's probably why the best part of his performance here is that simpering impression of Michelle Pfeiffer, and why he's made the most out of his career in Apatow bit-roles (where he would have actually laid a kiss on Douglas).There's something universal and organic about Thor swinging his hammer, or Captain America punching a Nazi in the face - you can almost see and hear the comic-sized POW on the screen. In the same vein, there's a simple joy in seeing a gigantic man in a red suit pluck a villain from down below as if he was just an ant. We've all played the same games as toddlers, stacking blocks to resemble cities, only to knock it all down. But start getting into this business about quantum particles and quantum entanglement, and you lose the audience. Why should we care about Ava Starr, when she didn't even exist until 30 minutes into the movie, jarringly inserted via exposition dump? Why should there be an ounce of tension as Janet and Hank race back to our quantum realm, when the rules are theoretical and all made-up anyway? Look at how the credits arrange themselves, as minuscule, model-like recreations of the main action, with tilt-shifted snapshots and bold yellow font. They epitomise the playfulness of this franchise, much like how Scott and his daughter bond over a makeshift cardboard adventure in their own home. Sticking to those outlines, Ant-Man can be plenty of fun."
410,5,"Mumbo jumbo unleashed The Ant-man series was weak from the start, unable to comply with the rules of physics it set itself. But at least in 2015 the idea of a sloppy shrinkable/inflatable superhero was fresher, so you were more willing to close your eyes on some inconsistencies.This time though, this mess of a premise went beyond any tolerable measure. With no ""real world business"" available for Ant-man, the film sets course for the unknown of the quantum realm, dropping pseudo-scientific nonsense as often as the Tarantino characters drop F-bombs. And the deeper the film goes in order to somehow explain what's going on and why all these people do what they do, the less logical sense it means. So towards the end we go from at least an illusion of some science to an almost Red-Witch-like magic. Might just as well have worn cloaks and waved hands all along the way.Paul Rudd and his comic relief/family values theme are still reasonably charming and mostly not overdone. But if Ant-man was supposed to recreate the success of Guardians of the Galaxy and its unserious approach, then I guess it needed something more than just Michael Peña's ridiculous babbling at super speed.With its cartoonish violence and size changing tricks, Ant-man and the Wasp could've been a nice kid flick, bright and colorful and constantly rushing somewhere. But a darker story and lots of uncomfortably long and uncommon words would turn kids off, while the lack of sense and too much silly humor don't go well with someone more adult. So to me this film was more of a miss.Except one thing. A huge drum-banging ant was dope! Makes you think about certain substances and their peculiar effect on the moviemakers' minds."
411,10,"Now this is the Ant-Man/Giant-Man and The Wasp that I read about in Marvel comics Especially on the flipside of special avengers issues, four issues that if you turned them upside down and lined them up, they created a big picture of giant man.Part of that story is in this film and there are elements from many other ant-man stories. The writer brings classic Ant-man into the same storyline as new Ant-man storiesAnd then you have more of the ""that's not a keychain"" happening, except now, Hank Pym has a full hot wheels collectors box of fun things.What irritates me, not about the movie but about walking through the landmine of dog Poodoo in the review section of identical verbatim reviews of this film about how feminist it is and how liberal it is. Go get stuffed, the stories were written before you were born and the writer of the stories wasn't writing a political story, they were writing a comic book.Go back to watching your YouTube so called fan edit of Star Wars the last Jedi that has all of the scenes with Princess Leia removed, you can show it at your Bund meeting.The state of the technology has gotten so good that you can't decipher what is the physical effect in this film and what is CGI. Any good film uses lots of practical special effects, and when you can't tell between the CGI and the practical, that is where success is made. And besides, Game of Thrones does this too, but you rant and rave about how good that show is, right?Unfortunately the ending of this film corresponds to the ending of avengers infinity war. So now the fate of ant man lies with the resolution of that story."
412,6,"Movie for 12 years old kids This is a childish movie probably very watchable for kids aged around 12. The story is utter nonsense as in too many Hollywoord-movies lately (f.i. The Predator). The only nice thing in the movie are the special effects which are really great. As said the story is stupid and with a lot of science hocus-pocus. Off course, all Marvel-movies have nothing to do with any reality at all but this movie is in that respect top of the bill. And the same thing as in the Star wars-movies: an open end so it is obvious that there will be another ant-man movie. I rate this movie a 5.5 but had to make it a 6 on imdb only because of the great special-effects but find it unbelievable that a movie like this is rated a 7.4 here... Watch it if you are into special effects, otherwise stay away and watch another movie or get drunk: both are better that watching ""Ant-man and the wasp""."
413,7,"I have absolutely no clue why the bad reviews ,, probably they just watched this movie without watching the first one !! or any other avengers movie !! The movie is funny ... Paul Rudd is hilarious .. the plot has no strong ""entanglement"" to the last stories ... and the surprise at the credits scene was crazy ,,connecting it to the last Avengers movie ,,.This movie has a strong plot ... really funny and the script to me looked as strong as the first movie in many scenes ... and as i said the last scene in an ""Avengers"" style making us expect for sure a third movie to come .The cast was great ,, Paul Rudd proved again he is the perfect Ant-man ,, the banter and the wittiness was endless ,, and the chemistry between him and Evangeline Lilly was on point ... I loved Michael Peña .. Oh my goodness the scene with the Truth serum was just crazy funny... in general all the characters did well .Final thought ,, there are a lot of weirdly bad reviews ,, but believe me when i say .. this is way better than the other Avengers sequels have ever been ,well maybe not Iron Man 2 .. but it is up there .. so watch it ,, not gonna regret it ."
414,9,Just as good as the first It's fun and entertaining nothing graphic just simple heroic movie for viewers. Great sequel to embark on with good plot; decent action and humor.
415,6,"Entertaining but moronic If you expect this to be Ant-Man doing heroic things against supervillains and The Wasp being super cute and powerful, you are just wrong. What happens is a bunch of people using shrink and wrap tech run around aimlessly like headless chicken and foil and hapless FBI agent, a regular powerless goon (which almost always gets the best of them) and a phaseless RAC agent (you'll get it, don't worry). You almost wonder what the hell are Laurence Fishburne, Michelle Pfeiffer, even Bobby Cannavale in such a pointless movie. Didn't they know they can get outside of FBI jurisdiction just by going to Canada or the Maldives? Didn't they know they can just go inside the goon and then expand until he explodes? And why is a girl who can phase in and out so dangerous when you can get small enough so she can't see you?Bottom line: ""The Wasp"" is merely a supporting character and ""Ant-Man"" isn't doing so much. If there is a hero in this whole thing it's Michelle Pfeiffer's character, who not only survives for 30 years in the quantum realm, but fixes just about everything when she gets back. Oh, and the end credits scene, that's hilarious, but a bit too much. A light comedy with Marvel characters, it's just ... meh!?"
416,4,"Even Marvel Has It's Misses... Aside from the remake of Fantastic Four this is by far the most lame superhero movie produced with such a huge budget. The plot is a hodgepodge of pseudo-scientific dribble that even a child can see the holes within. Every character in this film is 2-dimensional at best. So aside from the non-stop special effects, which are used in a Michael Bay style, there is nothing to bring anyone to the theater.Quite frankly, even Stan Lee's cameo is lame, and that is saying something. I highly suggest that if you do choose to give this film a chance that you go full-bore on the herbal essences prior to viewing as that is the only means by which any enjoyment will be attained via this two hour headache."
417,8,What a twist Brilliant example from Marvel again with a fantastic twist. Thanos strikes again
418,7,"Good part 2 I was impressed with the 1st one. This one didn't let down. This is part 2 to civil war and answers where he was in Infinity War. Glad they kept the hott woman Wasp in it unlike Deadpool 2, smart move."
419,7,"A lower tier MCU , but definitely a fun-to-watch movie! It's truly infuriating to see a movie with a well-constructed, self-contained story that has a completely nonsensical underpinnings. By that I mean the principles and theories of the Quantum realm. Honestly, I couldn't understand how some things are related to the others, and how some actions can affect specific matters. Everything seemed messy and preposterous to me. The problem is neither about how scientifically wrong the bases of this world are, I mean it's a Sci-Fi movie, and there must be non realistic representations to a lot of things, nor it's because the explanations we got aren't convincing. But the problem is that there are almost no explanations, nor what happen make any sense. As a Science Fiction movie, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a total misfire. But what about it as a comedy?The original play it safe, but managed to earn big laughs thanks to the exquisite visual humor, and smart jokes. This one really misses Edgar Wright's touch in the comedic aspect. There are some funny visual gags that landed very well, but they are way less inventive, and less smart than those of the first movie. Unfortunately, these silly jokes are neither hilarious to make me laugh out loud, nor they are plenty to make me forget about the other 70% of the humor that vary between cringe-inducing jokes and failed attempts to recycle some of the best jokes of the first Ant-Man movie, to other jokes that completely missed the mark because of the terrible comedic timing.The story itself is small-scale, and the plot is very cohesive. That made the drama work pretty well, besides that the entire cast was amazing. Both Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly gave a wonderful charismatic performances, and they have an incredible chemistry between each other. This time we blissed to see glimpses of Michael Douglas's great acting abilities; he really shines in this sequel. Michael Peña is good, but his character, Luis, isn't funny at all this time unlike in the first movie. I also likes the character of Jimmy Woo, played by Randall Park, although the humor we got from him was hit-or-miss for me. The father/daughter relationship between Scott and Cassie is so warm and sweet. It's even better this time, and Abby Ryder Fortson is fantastic!The action set-pieces aren't extraordinary, but they are truly fine, especially when it comes to the use of visual effects, which were spectacular, by the way. The final action sequence is the only one that is really impressive, which explains why it was used in fifty percent of every trailer for the movie. Unlike the poor illustration of the Quantum realm from the narrative standpoint, it was visually splendid in every sense of the word. From the creative depiction to the consistent use of colors, I was simply in awe of its look.I don't want to mention anything about the villain, because I don't consider an evil character who do nothing but explains her motives and abilities through some flashbacks in one single monologue as a real villain! I didn't like Hannah John-Kamen's character as the beta villain in Ready Player One, and I hated her in this movie as Ghost I guess, or whatever. I don't put the blame on the actress, though.Surprisingly, I found that all the main characters are three-dimensional and well-grounded. Their characteristics we knew from the original back in 2015 are established in this sequel, and therefore the characters became more developed.Overall, I think Ant-Man and the Wasp is a step back from its predecessor, and one of the most disappointing movies for me this year. But most importantly, it's one of the weaker MCU efforts in the last few years, and this is not a good sign at all. Nevertheless, this sequel is by no mean a bad movie, and definitely a fun to watch popcorn flick as all other MCU entries.(7/10)"
420,3,Movie for kids It seemed like i was watching tv children movie. next time i will show this movie to mine 6 year old daughter.. for me it was big meh...
421,1,"It is just very bad Bad, silly and unfunny movie! A wast of time. Don't understand why is so overrated!"
422,10,"easily one of the best sequels ever If you weren't BLOWN away by the first movie and was like 'its a great movie, not my favorite from the marvel universe but its good' then this movie is totally gonna change that opinion. As in the first movie, the humor is ON POINT, it just HAS that type of non-offensive HILARIOUS comedy in it and no awkwardness at all in their making. Paul Rudd, as always, really delivers this type of humor efortlessly. The storyline is amazing and you really get involved in the story. All in all the movie is amazing and I can say that 2018 was probably THE BEST Marvel year so far, their best movies were released this year without a doubt (exception for Ragnarok obviously). Congratulations Marvel for this amazing movie. Now go watch it sluts, its awesome and Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne are WAY too underrated in the MCU."
423,1,"Horrible, unless you are under 12 This movie was horrible. I am SO glad I did not pay to see it. It was trying to be funny but everything, and I mean everything, fell flat. Your 6 year old will probably like it though. The worst by far on all the Marvel movies."
424,1,"Couldn't manage to watch more than 5 minutes What a bad movie, poor right from the start. Perhaps the worst movie in the MCU."
425,3,"Funny, not much else Not much to say really, just a Marvel superhero movie that lands on the bland side. Not bad, not great, just stock marvel elevated by Paul Rudd, Evangeline lily, and Michael Peña giving it their all and delivering some great comedy.However, the plot is all over the place, the main villain is fine, the action is fine, the effects are pretty good, but whenever Rudd or Peña aren't on screen, It's painfully dull."
426,2,"Makes no Sense Is this a comedy, a sci-fi or nonsensical movie? I watched about an hour of it and came to the conclusion that I had no clue what I was looking at. It seemed that this movie was going backwards and forward through time without getting to a point or what was to be achieved. I concluded this is a nonsensical movie made for people (kids?) who lost their marbles. How anyone can enjoy this rubbish should all go into the quantum world, which they, no doubt, will thoroughly enjoy.Yet another Marvel failure, which has also poisoned the Walt Disney Studio, who produced this. Can no-one make a decent movie anymore?"
427,8,Great film This is a very good movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. If you like action movies you will like this movie. Spider man Home coming is better. But this see this movie. It is a great movie.
428,10,Very funny and entertaining movie !!! Don't believe those people who have given less rating for this movie. It was pretty amazing movie. I neve expected about the post credit scene. If u have not watched then go and watch the movie
429,5,"Bitterly disappointed!!! Hey after watching the trailer to ant man and the wasp i was generally excited to watch this,but was overally disappointed with the movie the storyline is waverly thin and lets down the first ant man,the only two aspects i found interesting and liked was one of the end credits scene and randall park playing the role of fbi agent jimmy woo which was quite funny,by marvel standards one of there weakest movies.!!!"
430,3,"A big hero with a small film One of the weakest films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has a shallow and uninteresting plot, doesn't cause impact, doesn't try to show something new and falls into the typical mistake of the films of this sub-genre, I mean, presents a lot of enemies, but none of them is well developed. The positive points are the action sequences and humor, this film has nice jokes, doesn't do the mistake of Deadpool 2 that only uses humor based on references to pop culture.I was expecting something better from this new entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after congratulating us with great films like Winter Soldier, Civil War, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther and Infinity War.Rating: 3.5/10 I don't know if Ant-Man and the Wasp is just a mistake from Marvel Studios or if it is a small sign of weariness about the superhero movies."
431,1,Just terrible I tried really hard to watch this movie twice and I can't do it.
432,5,"Can't keep filling voids with jokes Ant Man 1 took cinemas by blast, breathing a fresh wind by making a lesser known hero shine. The low key character with a more modest background was a relief among superheroes, war heroes and gods. In this movie he continues his actions, in an attempt to bring back Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer) from the Quantum Realm.Alas, Marvel continues it's ways in a manner that would make Michael Bay proud. Marvel's strength was keeping a nice and fragile balance between seriousness and humour. But like various recent Marvel movies, this one crosses the line over and over.How long can you entertain an audience by throwing shrinking and growing objects at enemies, and repeating that process as a lame attempt at creating SFX heavy action scenes?The only redeeming factors are Michelle Pfeiffer who steals every scene, and Hannah John Kamen, who is the backbone of this movie, by being the only one who seems to take her acting job seriously. Every other character is only their for reasons that resemble slapstick, and that is what this movie is."
433,9,Great from beginning to end This is the second Ant Man movie and what a sequel it is full of jaw dropping scenes and adventure.Real good inclusion to the marvel universe set of movies.You won't be disappointed and watch out for the giant condiment. Real great special effects throughout won't leave you disappointed.
434,7,"The Vidiot Reviews.... Ant-Man and the WaspThe easiest way to distract someone with the powers of a wasp is to spill a can of Coke.Mind you, the insects in this sci-fi movie are too determined to be diverted by refined sugar.On house arrest since he violated the Sokovia Accords, Scott (Paul Rudd) has been busying reconnecting with his daughter and starting a company with his friends (Michael Peña, T.I.). But when he receives a message from the quantum realm he must illegally suit up as Ant-Man and help Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lilly) locate their missing wife/mother.In the same jovial vein as the original, this side-splitting sequel also adds a new dimension to the fold with Lilly's Wasp, who not only makes an excellent foil to Ant-Man but she also amps up the action scenes.And while Bee Woman was the first choice, she died after firing her first stinger.

435,5,Not the best MCU installment Ant man and the wasp almost seems like a filler movie in the MCU. It does little to advance the story for future MCU installments. It has its funny moments and some decent action sequences. Overall probably the worst title to date in the MCU.
436,10,"Genial. Me gustó muchísimo, para mi por lejos mejor que la 1."
437,3,Ant-man is dead This movie is a failure. It is just not possible to watch if you are grown up either if you are a kid. In the first hour nothing is happening at all. If you are lucky you get asleep.
438,1,"Just bad I always see Marvel as a bad story telling company, but they link movies to give it the action everyone likes to see nowadays, this movie's story is not good and in the end of the movie you tell yourself where was the villain, and sadly you won't find him. Its a funny movie at some parts but it missed the main point of action, where there is non, only link between it and the avengers movie is in the cut scene after some credits at the very end, other than that I would say just skip to the credits because you will waste 2 hours of your life for nothing."
439,2,"Dreadful. Don't waste your time. Apparently Marvel has decided to do away with scriptwriters and use a committee of 10 year olds to write their movies, judging by this horrid example. The CGI was excellent; that's all that was even halfway decent.Paul Rudd is a perfect person to head this failure, since he can't act and isn't funny; the situations he's put into require a good actor and a comedian, but he just can't pull it off. Michael Douglas, Laurence Fishburne and Michelle Pfeiffer can act, but they don't get much opportunity. I'll see them again, in something worth watching; I'm sorry that they are in this incoherent mess, but I assume they've been well paid, and their reputations won't suffer much for this one stinker.The worst part of this film is that every once in a long while I got a tiny glimpse of something that might have been very good; but there's no drama, no suspense, no comedy, incoherent action, the timing is all wrong, and the many forced jokes all fall flat. Even Stan Lee's cameo didn't earn a chuckle. There's a lot of glittering fluff, but I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters- well, no: I did care about Ant-Man Paul Rudd. I wanted him to get lost, and not to be found, and to forget that I'd ever seen him! That might be partly the fault of the writers, who wrote his part making him stupid and having him act like a moron, or maybe it was his idea; it didn't help the film whoever is responsible.If you have the choice of watching paint dry or this movie- choose the paint. It'll be more satisfying and memorable! This film was simply boring, and I was relieved when it was finally over."
440,8,My review on this movie This how can explain it . Honestly it's a mind blowing movie great and simple plot fun and halerous . The action is stunning I really am happy for this movie it really put a smile on my face I am really proud marvel . These word are coming from a very big DC fan but I think mervel are doing a hundred time better
441,7,Good popcorn movie Good cast and and script makes an enjoyable movie thats not as predictable as you think
442,1,"Why this movie has made? I have some questions 1. Does Michael Douglas needs more money or he got bored of sitting in his house so he decided to work in such crap ?? No way this movie can make any money. 2. Why the producers didn't pay more efforts to find good scenario or any good thing to be shown in this movie? 3. Why would Hollywood insists going down year after year and produces such super bad movies? Well ... at the end, I would like to say that I have tried very hard to describe or to review this movie but I couldn't because it is very very very bad movie ... a shallow movie ... a silly and a non-sense movie .... a huge boring movie .... it is a piece of stupidity combined with triviality ..... this movie is a complete crap by all means."
443,5,Not as good as the first one Not what I was expecting. It's plain interesting like it doesn't keep you at the edge of your seat and that us so uncommon for Marvel movies. In short it was like a fairytale. I'm hoping they can do better next time . Tried to be nice because I really love Marvel movies.
444,4,"Good solid 4 star if - You did not see the prequal and did not know what to expect, if you did see the previous one - it's a 3. Mic. Douglas is so tired that really he should stop making films. the plot is terrible, basically most of the movie some people are looking for a tiny building that pass from hand to hand, then there are some computer graphics with lots of colors, and that's about it, wait, did i miss anything? hmm, no, that's about it. Good plot"
445,3,"Incoherent nonsense This film sadly fails Marvel in every way. It's the first one I've disliked. It relies on fake emotions and cliched tropes to draw people in. After half an hour, I failed to care about any of the 2D characters. Zero plot."
446,10,"Brilliant! It was intriguing! I had a doubt after watching the first one, but this movie changed my mind. I watched it because I had such an exhausting ride with 'Avengers Infinity War' This movie is so cool and intriguing from the beginning till the end. It is a must watch. I can't believe Marvels keep pulling it off. I am still not a fan of Black Panther however this one is worth more than Black Panther.This movie is funny and superb in the eye, got so many Wow! moments in it. Well made, fantastic work from Marvel. Rightfully deserved huge success,.. Thank you for the end Credit scene. It made my waiting for Avengers 4 so worthy. I would rate 8/10 for this movie but additional 2* is for Marvels Production. Thank you again."
447,8,DONT LISTEN TO SILLY OVER-ANALYTICAL CRITICS Do NOT listen to silly ppl talking about this movie isnt good! It is SO funny! If you liked the first Ant Man then you will like this one too! I thought his humor was so funny in the first and in this one and it also is NOT lacking in action!I thought this movie was AWESOME! Just enjoy it! It has an interesting ending too! Solid 8 for me!!!!
448,1,"Wow. Written by an 8th grader who saw Ant-Man, twice. Manages to make Rudd look bad... It's generous to call this movie ""predictable"" or flat. It's not even ""juvenile"". Just plain pablum with the same effects as the first, less science, no drama, zero laughs, and even Rudd manages to NOT be his charming self.The saddest part is: that as a Marvel fan I simply HAD to watch it. Maybe sadder: you do too.sorry for your luck."
449,4,"A MCU misfire Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been under house arrest for helping out Captain America in Berlin in Captain America 3. He has spent the time watching television, playing drums and learning close up magic. He also gets to spend some time with his daughter who visits him at weekends.However Lang gets a weird vision and contacts Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) who has been unhappy with him for rushing off to Berlin.Pym and his daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) were doing some experiments to get hold of Pym's wife, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) the original Wasp. She was lost in the Quantum World for some three decades. The experiment Hank and Hope conducted was at the same time that Lang had his vision.As they unite to free Janet from the Quantum World, some villains want to steal their technology and a new entity emerges called Ghost. The Ghost keeps phasing as its molecular structure is unstable and needs to absorb the energy from the Quantum World.The film is a contrived mess as shown by the six credited writers. The stakes might be small scale in comparison to the other MCU movies. The tone more lighthearted and breezy. I did not expect the film to be so inconsequential and the action so repetitive. It really is a series of elongated set pieces to pad out the two hours running time as the script is so flimsy."
450,7,"Not that bad Yes, the first one is better. But looks like so many KIDS gave very low rating to this movie.I suggest they make their own movie by themselves :-DI really enjoy watch this movie, what else you want? :-D"
451,2,"Worst MCU's year ever Damn, this film is boring. It should be action movie but for the 1h30min nothing happen and final action is too pretty lame. Jokes are not funny and villains really sucks. Avengers Infinity War was not bad except for annoying ""ending"" nut Black Panther and AntWasp are really terrible. Hope 2019 will be better."
452,4,Worst Marvel movie by far Dull story.... jokes where childish To much quantum jibrish No more dull storylines plz .. entertainment factor should be high for a marvel movie.Waste of time .. to bad.
453,10,"Mental Health Reading some of these reviews, I'm convinced that there are many people out there with mental issues.This was a fun movie. Anybody rating this a 1 has some kind of weird agenda"
454,3,"Extremely boring and dull Boring, no real story, characters you don't care for, and far, far too long. Full of unfunny jokes and silly one liners. If you are older than 10, avoid."
455,8,"Marvel has the action comedy down to a science So I finally got around to seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp at the theater. The first Ant-Man was all around a lot of fun, so I was very much looking forward to this movie. Thankfully this movie kept everything great about the original Ant-Man and built onto the franchise.The central plot of the movie was fairly typical Marvel storytelling. This of course not being a bad thing, at this point Marvel has making a fun action comedy down to a science. Unlike some of the other Marvel films though the conflic was less grandiose and operated on a smaller scale. This did allow for a less serious plot that allowed character interaction to shine, but made the central conflict feel less developed as a whole.The movie did provide an ample supply of non-stop action and slapstick dialogue to keep me entertained the entire time. The dialogue was all around well done and provided quite a number of genuine laughs. A big part of the movie was the all around likeability of Paul Rudd. He just oozed personality and does a great job playing the slacker anti-hero.The charm and all around chemistry felt between Ant-Man and the Wasp really was the centerpiece for the movie. It was quite a bit of fun seeing the two interact with each other on screen. On top of that the additional side characters were very funny and added quite a bit of comic relief to the film.The CGI and action scenes were also very well done. This of courses is expected from a Marvel movie at this point, but the growing and shrinking scenes were all around pure eye candy. Ant-Man and the Wasp's powers set also made for some fun and unique fight scenesThe movie did seem to have a few too many ideas and not enough execution. The movie could have done away with a few unnecessary subplots. I really also wasn't a fan of the main villain. Not only was she not developed or interesting, but she wasn't a fun villain in the least.At the end of the Ant-Man and Wasp is a fun addition to the Marvel Universe. It provides just enough fun action and slapstick humor to keep you entertained and distract you from the fact that the story isn't that developed. A 8.25 out of 10."
456,9,Great movie!!! Another great and very funny movie!!!! Also the best end credit Scene of all Marvel movies!!!
457,7,"A FUN FILM WITH A MEH-ISH STORY ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" starts strong with funny jokes, beautiful story set-up and CGI young Michelle and Michael. Sadly, after the first action sequence, the story became meh. I don't know who Janet is and I didn't care if she was rescued or not. I wished they told me who she was even more for me to care about her safety. The story started to become good again at the 3rd actAs for other positives, here they are:The CGI antsThe chemistry between Rudd and Lilly.The guy that makes sure Lang is on house arrest was funnyMost of the action scenesTHE MID-CREDITS SCENE!!!!!!!!!!!!Overall: this is an enjoyable movie that is not aa good as the first one"
458,2,"Most childhish acting i have seen in high paid movie I left cinema after 30 minutes ,i just felt ..i cant describe ..it was bad.. I don't think i have seen such Bad acting performance in any high budget movies. Seriously , if u gave the roles to bunch of robots it would have been better acted.. Douglas..seriously man this is not kind of movies you should be acting in.. disaster worse then 3rd grade movie production."
459,5,"Weak story & faulty script considered ends on avg. note. For any movie the story is the soul. When we consider story of Ant-Man and the Wasp it ends on average grounds.When Sci-Fi genre is considered what strikes the movie to stand in crowd is the true nature of Science involved. This is where Ant-Man and the Wasp fail's. In the movies like Jurassic park or Godzilla or recent classic like Interstellar the science is precise. On the other hand when this movie is considered it deals with quantum realm and a structure would survive in that size is quite a faulty notation.One more thing, when something shrinks mass becomes concentrated and on expansion it dilutes. These factors are not taken into account while filming or scripting, for me another drawback.Final Verdict: This movie addresses faulty science with a weak story. For me a drawback but being new or a genre fan may excite you."
460,2,This is extremely overrated By far the Thor 2 and Iron Man 3 are better than this movie.. I couldn't stop rolling my eyes.. it's a Movie for children the age of Scott Lang's daughter.
461,6,"Polarizing Movie? Yep, & I Like It Ant-Man and the Wasp breaks the mold and there is apparently lots of folks on both sides of the fence on this one. It's lots of things except what the DC faithful seem to want. Well, sorry but it doesn't sink it. At least for quite a few of us.First Paul Rudd is imminently likable as Ant-Man. He plays his character in quite a pickle just fine. He brings a lightness with entertainment value to a universe at odds with him. His little business venture has great characters who help with the comedic spin, not to mention the great flummoxed FBI agent. The other worldly science is plopped into the mix often with quite a strain by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly who make the audience root harder as they fight a quantum entangled ghost and a ludicrous gang of thugs. Yep, it's a crazy stew with lots of action too. So, leave the DC aficionados out of the equation and it's just a silly and wild ride. No one expected Gone With The Wind anyway. Have some fun and quit being grumpy and enjoy a different spin on some dusty comic book formulaic characters. Or not?"
462,1,"Tired of Female Superheroes In this movie:Antman and a bunch of girls who can take on 10 musclebound men. Girls who weight 120 lbs dripping wet beating the hell out of 10 men each 1 vs 10. How many times do we have to have this crammed down our throats? I am so tired of female leads and girly-men. Womyn superheroes with no background and who are all of a sudden master martial artists high-kicking 10 guys in a row in the face and knocking them all out ITS NOT FUN TO WATCH. It's cheesy and ridiculous and not at all realistic. Why no strong male leads anymore? Brawl on Cell Block 99 is by far the best movie this year, hands-down. Tired. of. it. Paul Rudd the girly-man is our male lead here... You can see every ""twist"" coming a mile away... predictable crappy movie with an agenda... Really lame."
463,10,Funny and Entertaining Ant-Man was one of my favorite Marvel movies and this one did not disappoint. I took my son to see it for his 7th birthday and he had a blast.
464,10,"To all the people saying this is boring No. No, this isn't what we call boring. This was a great movie and was more of a comedy than a suspense or thriller. The villain isn't exactly the villain. And I think it was very obvious that she wasn't promoted as the villain in the trailers either. The base theme of Ant Man Part 1 was superhero comedy, which in turn was used to fill the gap for the next movie (Civil War). And guess what, it did. Remember Iron Man's conscience talking? I guess this one is too for those fans and MCU geeks who follow the story and appreciate how good Marvel is with the details of each and every character and plot. The post credit definitely left us stunned and made sure that Ant Man is an important character for Infinity War 2 (or Avengers 4). The whole point is, you gotta watch this with a mindset of one who wants to watch some crazy action with comedy. And then with the mindset of one who also wants to know the correlation with Avengers 4. If you're expecting a great story, congratulations my friend, you're in the wrong universe, where alien invasions happen and superheroes save the world!"
465,7,"Enjoyed it, but it isn't Marvel's best A very watchable and fun movie. Doesn't compare well against the more recent MCU movies, but still a good watch."
466,8,"Another hit from Marvel A lighter and more fun take on the Marvel Universe with plenty of gags, slapstick scenes and superhero action. The special effects look great, especially in 3D, and although they lack some of the thrills and suspense of the other Marvel films, the action scenes are still very entertaining to watch. The story is good as although it is a bit repetitive, it manages to mix the humour in without detracting from the plot, and the strong cast of characters are funny and charming."
467,4,"Not Good Enough There are two reasons why you should watch this movie: A if you are wondering who is that ant man that appears in other avengers' movies B if you have watched the first movie and you were hoping that they might have improved this one. And there are two reasons why you shouldn't watch this: A if you find it just rediculous that there is a man who rides ants or is a super hero that the only thing he does is to call ants and grow small or large. If this was only a comedy, or a parody of the superhero movies, than yes, this one will be interesting. But if you think that it takes itself too seriously, than don't watch it. B if you can't remember what happened in the first movie. The first ant man film was actually it's best, so if you find it that forgetable, than this one will be even more so."
468,1,bummed I couldn't even get thru the movie because unlike the previous Ant-Man movie it was boring and just plan sucked. What happened Marvel? Where did all the creativity go?
469,7,"IM READY DADDY This movie wasn't bad. I initially took a point off for Hello Kitty and Hot Wheels placement but later gave it an extra point for one of the opening lines being ""I'm ready daddy""."
470,7,"Fluffy...that's really it. After the amazing and larger than live movie that was Infinity War, naturally it's though to continue on such a high note. Now I totally understand that Ant-Man And The Wasp is not trying to be as good or as huge, but that doesn't mean that this movie should be miles beneath that level right? Now I can say that this movie is pretty much your basic MCU movie, that being a fast, humoristic, light-hearted superhero movie with not THAT much at stake.I wasn't dissapointed with this movie because I knew what I would probably get. I really like the first Ant-Man for being a little bit different but also for having a good heart and very good humor. This movie definitely tries to re-live that same vibe I think, but it does not always work in my opinion.It works when we see Scott interacting with his daughter which is very sweet, it works when we see Hank and Hope interacting about how to rescue their mother/wife. The humor also mostly works and there are tons of feel good moments for the fans of course.It doesn't work when we get to the villains. The first Ant-Man movie was very fun but I thought the villain was pretty much one of the weakest aspects. In this movie we actually have two villains, both with totally different motivations. The first villain let's say has no reason to be in the movie. He just appears every now and then with an extremely weak motivation and in the end had no impact to the story. The second villain is much better, this one has a kind of compelling backstory and definitely does have good reason to be in the story, however the way the film decided to deal with this villain in the end felt really lazy.Guys, this isn't a bad movie, definitely not! But I do prefer the first Ant-Man over this one. It has good moments but some characters just feel really flat and have no purpose.I'll give it a 7/10.PS: Make sure you watch the mid-credits scene!!!"
471,8,Very entertaining Love Paul Rudd as an actor and loved this movie. Many funny parts and kept me entertained the entire movie. Stay until after the credits!
472,8,It suffered from the first one It was an enjoyable movie but added noting new from the first one.
473,8,"Actually has more structure than you think I have to say, all the Marvel movies linking together now is something that is really genius. There are certain connections you have to make to other movies that really make you say ""why did she do that? Oh because it links back up to Civil war or the first one."" Anyways but lets review this movie. Overall, if you haven't seen any other Marvel films and this is your first experience with one, I strongly encourage you to press stop, and go back to Iron man 1 and Captain america the first avenger. If you don't want to go back that far, maybe just watch the first Ant man. This movie is good. The visuals are nice, the jokes (as per the usual now with marvel films) come more and when you least expect them, and the physics of the Ant-man world really do mess with your a head a bit. I recommend it if you want something a bit more light hearted and for a quick entertaining film."
474,8,"Great Sequel I did watch both of the Ant-Man movies and i prefer to watch this one than the prequel. Ant-Man is one of my favorite MCU heroes. Wasp is also, good performance by Evangeline Lilly. Great humor and i love the screenplay."
475,9,"Great Film! Recently I watched the Marvel Film Ant-Man and the Wasp, the sequel of Ant-Man. The story follows Scott Lang (Ant-Man), and his attempt to help his friends Hank Pym (the original Ant-Man) and Hope Van Dyne (the Wasp), to rescue Hope's mother and Hank's wife, Janet Van Dyne (the original Wasp) from the perplexing Quantum Realm. However, Scott has do do all this whilst under house arrest for aiding Captain America in Captain America: Civil War. And to make things even worse, the mysterious Ghost and the black market crime lord Sonny Burch are both after Hank and Hope. Fortunately, Ant-Man and the Wasp have a few size-changing tricks up their sleeves!I liked Ant-Man and the Wasp because it was full of action, suspense, funny characters and cool tech. My favourite part of the film is the big car chase through the streets of San Francisco, which includes shrinking cars, a truck used as a skateboard, and a life sized Hot Wheels!I would give the film a 9 out of 10, because it was very interesting and had a good storyline, but was a little too fast paced for my liking, with the whole story happening in 3 days movie time. However, that did not prevent it from being a fantastic film that I would definitely recommend to others. Although I would suggest you watch the other Marvel Cinematic Universe films first, as a relatively large backstory knowledge is required."
476,7,An good film in the MCU Ant man and the wasp was good but not amazing or equally bad. It produced a couple of laughs but not as many as the first one as some of the jokes were over used in the second one. One character I had a problem with was ghost aka Eva. This is because I didnt connect or feel bad for the character.
477,5,"Not a do again I didn't really care for the first one so I kinda went in to this one with low hopes. It was slow, boring, and really not as funny as the first one. I had trouble staying engaged. It just kinda lost me half way through. Sorry but I give it a 5/10"
478,6,"Physicists beware, but its a lot of fun Even by movie science standards, the movie science in the Ant Man movies is... just... I mean, I can suspend my disbelief, I really can, but its almost distractingly bad in this one, and core to the plot to boot. THAT BEING SAID, I love how creative the action in these movies can be, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't grin the full way through that car chase scene.Watched Aug 19, 2018"
479,5,"Unexpected snoring I find several MCU films in the boring section in my opinion, I never would have thought Ant-Man and the Wasp would be in that section, even after Infinity War being out. I'm kind of disappointed, and kind of shocked. The only thing I liked about this movie was the end credits scene which was much more entertaining than the actual film. I would've thought we passed this stage at this point..."
480,8,"A Solid MCU addition Not the best Marvel film.....not the worst. It was enjoyable, funny, good action scenes and overall a pleasant watch. However, compared to the greats Marvel Studios has been pumping out recently, it doesn't really compare."
481,5,"Bland and forgettable And before you say it, no I am not a DC fan, I'm not just giving this film this rating for that reason, I'm not a fan of marvel, I am willing to appreciate the good did of both of these major studios and this is not one of them.This film is very generic marvel, there is nothing new, inventive or interesting, it's just bland, when I look at it, I really can't remember anything, because it's just extremely average, everything is very average, there is nothing interesting or memorable, it's fun the first time, but there is no point to rewatching because you'll forget it in a second, the characters aren't memorable at all, Paul Rudd's character is no where near on the level as he was on the first film, there was nothing bad, nothing good, nothing interesting, it was just bland and forgettable, I wouldn't recommend it, because of how boring it can be, but it's very average.I forgot to add the part about the musical score, this is a major problem with all Marvel films because Marvel just overlook it and think, well if there's explosive action, and funny characters, we could get away with it the music is repititive and yet again Marvel struggles with the musical score, just as I expected."
482,2,Dont To make it short and sweet I didn't like this movie and even stopped it half way through.The reason is because the consumerism was so much that it distracted me.I could not focus on the movie because of it.Why should I pay money to watch a bunch of ads?I also thought the movie plot and acting was very poor.It simply just wasn't a good movie.
483,7,"Score may contain trace amounts of nuts If you expect a good Marvel movie, then you'll be dissapointed. BUT! If you know what to expect more or less and you can shut down most of your brain functions, then you'll enjoy it.That being said, After watching Ant-man 1 I knew exactly what I should expect, thus my score is 7/10."
484,8,"Impressive action and humour while developing characters to make Ant-Man's world more full and meaningful! I watched it twice! The second instalment of Ant-Man franchise did a great job in delivering more advanced and fluid action scenes, fully taking advantage of the size changing quantum technology. Evangeline Lilly carries a lot of action, while Paul Rudd continues his charming Ant-Man heroic adventure, sprinkled with some sweet moments with his daughter. Humour is peppered throughout the movie, from poking fun of the quantum technology, ants, gangsters, father/son in-law awkward exchanges between Lang and Dr. Pym.The movie screen time is balanced enough to let supporting cast shine, e.g. back story of Dr. Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer's Wasp, the mysterious kick-ass Ghost, Dr. Foster, Lang's buddies, and the FBI agent Woo. The villain played by Walton Goggins is not memorable, as he wasn't handed unique lines. He actually played a more interesting villain in Tomb Raider because he got screen time to add some melancholy and introspection to his character.It is impressive that at 2 hour running time, the movie is evenly funny, touching and kick-ass from start to finish. It really doesn't have lag time. I didn't catch some of the hilarious dialogues and awesome fight scenes, so I watched it twice."
485,7,"Predictable, light, fun movie. The movie kept me engaged, with some one-liners and scenes making me chuckle every once in a while. The movie keeps moving at a good pace. Story was very predictable. The action sequences were decent. Acting wasn't very high caliber. I liked the writing and the screenplay."
486,2,"Why did you left at the first mommy? The film was pretty slow with no goals to do , just annoying daughter who is a headache since the childhood wants her mommy back"
487,8,"Not as good as the first... but still good. As the title says, Ant-man was a tad better but I still found this as a highly enjoyable side story. It does not have the epicness save the world plot as we have come to expect from most Marvel films but has heart. My one major complaint is that they did not utilize the Ghost as much as they should have in this movie. Honestly Ghost needs her own film, as I was expecting some epic battle sequences like we see in Matrix Revolutions with the twin ghost scenes. I gave the original Ant Man a 9/10 this one is 8/10 borderline 7/10. One redeeming quality of the film is that the end credits show why Ant Man was not in Infinity Wars :)"
488,5,"Such a disappointment I was so disappointed by this film. It was a decent premise but the writing and production were terrible. The comedy came across very forced. Each scene was too short, packed with too much action and not enough story. Having two adversaries took up too much story time."
489,3,Bad beyond recognition Its so bad it has to be put down. I am so sorry Michael Douglas career got to this.
490,5,"Enough Already! Look, yes some super hero movies are great.Yes they make ton a' cash at the BO.Yes they're all good fun.But please can we make film about people again???!!Why is every film now a super hero film?Please come on people, lets make film about PEOPLE!"
491,9,"Had a blast I loved this movie from start to finish. Not 10/10 (Only Marvel films) like Infinity War but nonetheless amazing Loved ghost. Definitely my top 5 marvel villians. Guess Marvel finally learned how to make good, deep villians"
492,10,"Very cute and funny The movie was great!! Perfect follow up to infinity war, cheers you up the relationship between Scott and his daughter is beyond adorable"
493,9,"Better Than Antman in my Opinion A great Superhero Flick that has a great Antihero (Ghost) and some really fun moments. Paul Rudd does it again, and this time everyone else is better than ever before. There are obvious issues but I really enjoyed my time watching this one.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 9/10 Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 6/10"
494,7,Worth a watch Ignore the 1 & 2 out of ten comments; they lack appreciation of what makes a movie and its entertainment value or they struggle to count past two. Solid movie and typically well balanced for a Marvel movie. DC need to take a few lessons from them.
495,4,"When recycling old material doesn't work The sequel to the Ant-Man from 2015 leans heavily on the goodwill produced by the first one and wastes it. There's a lot of repetition and barely anything new. Admittedly there's a lot going on all the time, but without a clear focus. I've always found the individual films between each Avenger movie to be more of a snack until the next big meal and after the gigantic Infinity War that certainly is the case here.The main plot concerns the heroes trying to find a way to get Pym's wife out of the quantum realm. Along the way we also stumble upon a black market dealer also interesting in quantum technology, Scott's struggling security business and his attempt to slip and out of his house while in a house arrest. Not the most exciting stuff. Then there's the villain, who I think is one of the weakest ones in Marvel cinematic universe so far. Her powers are unique, but in the end, a bit underwhelming. She's supposed to be a tragic figure, but her backstory is told so hastily that I couldn't get any grip on her. It feels there's so much more to her story, but what we get is a one minute recap of it.The film recycles almost all the high points of the first one and not much new is invented here. Not even the new character Wasp brings in anything new. Besides her wings and blasters she has the same powers as Ant-Man. His powers also remain basically the same, except when his suit malfunctions and turns him into the size of a teenager. It's there only for the laughs, and the scene where he and the Wasp break into a school when he's stuck in his teenage form feels forced and like sidestep in the overall story even there's a reason for them to be there. It's just that forced. The same type of visual jokes from the first Ant-Man are recycled here. The overgrown Thomas the tank engine is replaced by an overgrown Hello Kitty Pez dispenser thrown at the enemies. Michael Pena's Luis again tells a story in a same fast pace as in the first one. Scott has a falling out with Hoppe and Pym at the start of the film, only for them to rekindle their romance again which we saw at the end of the first Ant-Man. I had hoped that the sequel would be a step forward, but instead it barely moves anywhere.It seems that Marvel has the sort of ""if it isn't broken, don't try to fix it"" mentality. The first two Thor are probably the two Marvel movies that have received the most criticism. They took a risk and reinvented Thor as a pure comedy in Ragnarök. Granted, Marvel took a risk in the first Ant-Man, but not as big as they could have taken, if Edgar Wright had remained as the director. I imagine it wouldn't had looked anything like the film we got. For me the first Ant-Man's driving force is the character itself. He's new and unique. The other aspects of the film are the same old Marvel we've seen throughout the years. Not including the differences of the characters, the Marvel films feel very homogeneous. They reuse the winning formulas of the previous films. In other words, if it's not broken, don't try to fix it. With Ant-Man & the Wasp, Marvel attempted to reuse the things that made the first one great, and ended up breaking it."
496,6,Insipid The movie didn't surprise me and The story is insipid. By the way bad guys are necessary I don't think it was a wonderful movie is just the movie I think worse six stars
497,3,"Not good Just not quality. The effects were nice, but the acting and plot line were mediocre"
498,10,"Nice dessert after Infinity War, salad for Avengers 4 Good plot, good structure, good actors, good overall"
499,7,"Antman fights with circumstances - not villains MCU has now mastered the art of churning out movies based on marvel comics - and turning them into profitable franchises.With this - MCU might have got another successful franchise.The movie by itself is unlike any other superhero movie you would see. There is no 'super villain'. The movie centres around the core task of bringing back Hank's wife - Janet from Realm beyond quantum barrier , and an anti hero in the form of Ava - a being in quasi quantum state.The movie is not without its bloopers per se. For example - Janet is stuck in a realm beyond the quantum realm where time doesn't apply the same way as normal world - however she has gotten as old as Dr. Hank. Evangeline Lilly is pretty is pretty - but honestly looks too old against Paul Rudd.Ava - is just a hollow character with nothing but vengeance inside. Surprising , considering how close she and her good hearted mentor are.Would recommend one time watch."
500,7,"the second ANT-MAN standalone film chirpily rests on the laurels of its predecessor's refreshing size-shifting visual pizzazz and stimulating funny bone Pigeonholed as an entr'acte between Marvel's two juggernaut AVENGERS superhero farragoes, the second ANT-MAN standalone film chirpily rests on the laurels of its predecessor's refreshing size-shifting visual pizzazz and stimulating funny bone, competently guides audience to the finish-line through a rambunctious if not unexpected joyride.As per usual, the original team returns with some new recruitment, fresh familiar faces like Pfeiffer (whose hype of being cast as Janet van Dyne, the original Wasp, is disproportionate to her actual screen time) and Fishburne are both ritualistically granted with a digitally de-aged treatment along with Douglas in their flashback sequences; a new villain Ava Starr aka. Ghost (played by an impetuous Hannah John-Kamen), at least has her own self-preserving urgency in playing havoc with the triad of Ant-Man Scott Lang (Rudd), Wasp Hope van Dyne (Lilly), upgraded to a rare co-lead prominence in Marvel's universe, and Hank Pym (Douglas), Hope's father and the original Ant-Man, in lieu of some inarticulate, cosmic plan of ruling the entire universe (Thanos, it's you I'm referring to). Among the holdovers, Michael Peña's improvising genius Luis, has more field work to operate this time but also doesn't miss the chance of welcoming a truth-revealing potion with sheer alacrity.Truly, the whole enterprise has a limpid self-knowledge of not burdening Ant-Man and co. with too much hefty agendas, and opts for child-parenting, a universal topic barely touched on by all other Marvel pictures, to be the icing on the cake, and it works in favor of cranking up Lang's affability and normalcy (also owing to Rudd's straight-arrow comic bent and an endearing Abby Ryder Fortson who plays Lang's precocious daughter), at one point Fishburne's antagonist even righteously reprimands Ghost for floating the idea of kidnapping Lang's daughter as a game-changer, saving us from the go-to cliché afflicted to anyone who is inevitably entangled with a superhero.Less engaging when it comes to the adult bond between Hank and Hope, adult father-daughter bond has a less winning facade to pull off, and the geeky involvement of the esoteric quantum realm (presumably will be put into critical use into reviving the perished ones in the next chapter of AVENGERS), a common challenge when a film tries to introduce something that is still scientifically inexplicable, we only get the peripheral gestures, the paranormal connection between Lang and Janet, the mutable tunnel open to the realm, the magic healing power and so forth, for general audience, it is more than enough.No one expects ANT-MAN AND THE WASP to be a genre ground-breaker when ANT-MAN sets a providential template for it to emulate (the trope of hopping from gigantism to micro-shape and everything in between can still legitimately turn heads and induce lulz), meanwhile, as a flyweight riding on the coattail of Marvel's ever-ambitious-and-lucrative momentum, it also makes sense that its modest ambition is not purely out of aesthete choice, but also out of the functional necessity of a palate-cleanser between the two extravagant main courses, moreover, it might throw a light on the remarkable business savvy that separates Marvel Universe from DC Universe relative to luring ticket-buyers."
501,7,"Not bad at all I really spent some quality time with my brother. A plethora of laughters, thanks for made our night. But how did her survive 30 years in quality realm??"
502,8,"Fun for big and small After the events of infinity war it is nice to be brought back down to size by this small enclosed film. Antman and the Wasp has some great laughs and character moments through out the movie. You instantly fall back in love with Scott and his out and out good dad approach. There is brilliant acting through out the film with no one really letting the cast down.My main issue with the film is that it seems to have direction but there is a lack of urgency and risk for the plot to move along to, it feels like they needed to throw a quick line in with no explanation in order get a sense of urgency but it is never really felt. Typical MCU there is a lack of a solid villan, the motives seem half harted and the advertised villan actually wins your heart.I give it a 8/10 for quality of film, however it is very enjoyable and another solid entry to the MCU."
503,10,"Amazing It's definitely amazing. I've never laughed so high in the theatre. Unlike other Marvel movies, Ant-Man and the Wasp is more independent from MCU, and has its own style. It surely what the audience needs after watching so many other superhero movies that are good but just alike. Really looking forward to the next Ant-Man and the Wasp's movie. And really hope Marvel Studio could make more movies like this one."
504,6,"It's ok Really don't know why with the ant man films they have gone on the hard comedic route. Joke after joke and it's probably funny for the kids (I know I saw it today and it was a laughing factory). To me it wasn't serious enough as the plot was stable but 2 villains that didn't get much back bone, one was nearly on the brink of death but hides away and the red neck gets busted. I could see the direction it was heading. Like once they had found the mother/wife why didn't they question her on how she drank and ate or where she found the white rags?? She never had that while wearing the suit. How did she have make up on? How did she not mentally break down or suffer any injuries?It showed potential but where the seriousness was getting there it then dropped a joke. I can see why he doesn't match up to iron man or Captain America. It's like another leach on marvel. I can't take the character serious if his series is a joke. Just another cash cow. Hopefully they can go 15/18 on a marvel film and make it into a real superhero"
505,8,"A Fun Movie There is nothing wrong with a movie being standalone but when connected to a cinematic universe they could have put a few more references to the MCU in I'd probably give it a 10 then, but overall it's a fun movie worth a watch not as funny or entertaining as the first but it certainly has it's moments it's a much better sequel than guardians volume 2 was and for once brings a villain I'll remember as well as some quality Michael Douglas moments it's a solid entry in the MCU and like Ragnarok brings some light hartedness to a currently quite dismal universe."
506,7,"Ant Meh and The Wasp Went to go see Ant Meh and the wasp on a Wednesday afternoon,.Overall, an enjoyable time at the pictures. A nice palette cleanser after Infinity War.Much smaller stakes than Infinity War, much, much, much smaller stakes.Fights were well choreographed, with good use of things shrinking and being blown up. Although am pretty tired of women on women fight scenes, nice to see they mixed it up here. Slightly.Deaging of characters was amazing!I felt that many of the jokes fell flat, although Michael Pena's scenes were comedic gold compared to other comedic duds. No Thor Ragnarok, that's for sure. A Taika Watiti pass of the script would have been an idea.Was I the only one to spot a nice Quantum Leap reference, with Scitt Lang saying ""Oh Boy"" on the initial Quantum realm chat between Hank and his daughter.Hannah John-Kamen steals the show. as The Ghost. A worthy advisory for both Scott and Hope. Like Killmonger in Black Panther, you're in two minds as to just how unreasonable the villain is. To an extent almost siding with her.Walton Goggins was an odd unnecessary character addition, but a pleasure to watch chew up the scenes he was in.All in all ok. But would probably wait for the DVD, I'm just glad we had a certain 2 for 1 ticket."
507,7,"Fun Fun Fun After the great successo of ""Avengers: Infinity War"", MCU returns to theaters with a very different movie, and probably this just decrees the success of the film. Much more ironic and joking than the last film marvel, the film sees the return of Paul Rudd in the role of Antman, flanked entirely by the cast of the first film dedicated to the hero. The plot is very linear, far from the complexity of Infinity War, but the continuous humorous gags, alternating with some more serious scenes, make the film a good product, which with the post-credits scenes is well rejoined to the main thread of the saga."
508,8,Good but not great Seeing another Marvel release I needed to see this and although this was a good movie and showed a lot of premise I didn't really understand the relevance in which Ava had to the movie overall and seemed a bit of a let down to me.I thought the end showing how he was in the quantum realm and stuck there due to the others being evaporated really worked with how Ant-Man will not be able to be in Infinity War part 2 and how the film is still set after Inifinity War.
509,10,"Better than I expected I Love this film that brings me lots of fun. In the film, ""never hurt a child"" impresses me ! A villain is not absolute a villain."
510,7,"Entanglements of a Quantum Nature in Ant-Man & the Wasp (Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)""Do you guys just put the word 'quantum' in front of everything?"" - Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne), Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly)Potential spoilers belowI had mentioned in the #9 entry (Baby Driver) of my Top 10 Films of 2017 article that the unfortunate departure of writer-director Edgar Wright from the 2015 Disney-Marvel film Ant-Man ""still lingers in the minds of some film buffs."" Wright had spent a decade on the project with co-writer Joe Cornish. Both ended up stepping down due to creative differences with the studio, settling with a little more than writing and story credits.Wright went on to make Baby Driver (his biggest commercial success). Meanwhile, Ant-Man's new director Peyton Reed, new writer Adam McKay, and lead star/new co-writer Paul Rudd took the then-latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to fair critical and commercial success in 2015. Ant-Man, as the follow-up to the dense excess of Avengers: Age of Ultron from several months earlier, earned respect for its smaller stakes (i.e., no devastated cities for once) and clever shrinking effects. That said, like Age of Ultron before it and Doctor Strange a year later, its overall plot has demonstrated such paltry memorability, save for its comedic tone and supporting star Michael Peña's manic narrated recountings.Three years on and the sequel, Ant-Man & the Wasp, serves as the first of two sidequests during the year-long intermission established by Avengers: Infinity War (the second being next March's Captain Marvel). Thankfully, Ant-Man & the Wasp is freed from having to reorient audiences with Ant-Man lore. The superhero blockbuster follow-up, though flawed, benefits from its constrained time setting and multiple antagonists for its heroes.Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd, also co-writing) is days away from completing the two years of superhero-less house arrest he was forced to serve due to the events of 2016's Captain America: Civil War. Scott does his best on weekends to entertain his young daughter Cassie (an ever-adorable Abby Ryder Fortson). On other days, he manages the struggling security business he has started with ex-cons Luis (an excitable Michael Peña), Dave (Tip ""T.I."" Harris), and Kurt (David Dastmalchian).After experiencing a bizarre vision involving a woman, Scott is kidnapped by Hope Van Dyne/Wasp (Evangeline Lilly), who leaves an ant decoy at his house to avoid arousing the suspicion of FBI agent and Scott's overseer Jimmy Woo (Randall Park). The woman in Scott's vision, as it turns out, is Hope's mother Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Janet has been trapped in the subatomic quantum realm for the past thirty years. Scott had managed three years earlier (in the first Ant-Man) to enter and exit the quantum realm alive, so Hope and her father, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), have been developing the machinery to potentially rescue Janet. However, black market dealer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) wants Pym and Van Dyne's technology for greater financial gain, while the mysterious Ava Starr/Ghost (an arachnid-like Hannah John-Kamen) seeks the technology to rid herself of a painful molecular instability that allows her to phase through matter. Scott and the father-daughter engineering duo thus embark on a race against time, not just to rescue Janet, but for Scott to avoid jeopardizing his freedom right as he is about to reclaim it.Ant-Man & the Wasp spares its viewers from excess exposition involving most of its established characters. The first Ant-Man devoted some time to setting the organic sequel path of saving Janet Van Dyne from the quantum realm. Here, that setup culminates in some of the script's more clever moments, including a most amusing scene in which Janet possesses Scott in front of Hope and Hank. It would not surprise me if director Reed and co. had Ms. Pfeiffer perform the scene first so that Rudd could match her. Elsewhere, a scene shared by Burch, his goons, and the truth serum (""It's not truth serum!"")-injected Luis, Dave, and Kurt entertains in explaining both the origin of Scott and Luis' friendship as well as how Scott became involved in the events of 2016's Civil War.Beyond its impressive and dependable shrinking effects, two of Ant-Man & the Wasp's additional strengths include its constrained time setting and its trio of opposing parties - Sonny Burch, Eva/Ghost, and Jimmy Woo. The few days remaining for Scott's house arrest keeps audiences aware of Agent Woo. At the same time, the uncertain handful of days remaining until Eva/Ghost dies from her molecular instability pushes her harder to steal Pym and Van Dyne's precious technology. Thus, she becomes a more formidable antagonist, even with her heavy backstory and a thankless turn by Laurence Fishburne as Pym's estranged research partner turned Eva/Ghost's mentor. (Interestingly, Ms. John-Kamen appeared in Ready Player One and both she and Goggins in Tomb Raider from earlier this year.) These dire circumstances are perhaps why Burch and his goons (including Divian Ladwa of 2016's Lion fame) feel the least intimidating of the three opposing parties. It was wise for the writers to offset this by giving them an early serious scene and funnier reappearances later.Most will agree that Ant-Man & the Wasp will forever lie in the shadow of Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther in terms of the MCU in 2018. Still, it leaves me content that a relatively light and non-origin comedic diversion, like Ant-Man & the Wasp, was just fun enough for the moment. I can forgive it for its blockbuster conveniences and for not leaving as indelible an impression as its fellow MCU installments. By electing, not for another corporate/world dominator, but for four character parties whose goals generate friction in a comedic playground lasting only one week, Ant-Man & the Wasp merits such clemency.And so the ant drums on...(Parental Note: Ant-Man & the Wasp has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA ""for some sci-fi action/violence"". It has also been rated 12A by the BBFC for ""moderate violence"", and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""much stylized violence, acceptability of divorce, a couple of uses each of profane, crude and crass language, several milder oaths, and occasional wordplay."")(P.S. Keep an eye out for the obligatory Stan Lee cameo, a mid-credits scene, and a post-credits scene.)R.N.B."
511,2,"Made Iron Man 3 entertaining This movie by far was BORING with absolutely predictable story line, dull lifeless characters, a lot of drama with little storyline. They assume you have the feels for these characters who you've barely seen on screen, is nothing like the comics, and therefore who you care nothing about. Not really sure why it's ""and wasp"" was it because of the subtext of a love story? Who knows. It had a few moments of amusement but then you realize how absolutely dumb the comedy was because they repeat the same premise of that joke over and over and over again in the movie. I have insomnia and this movie put me to sleep. Yet another example of the future of MCU as Disney dulls it down. Waste of time and money I will not be watching if and when they make another one."
512,7,"A fun, lazy, Average but entertaining take on the MCU. Ant-man & the Wasp was another fun, lazy, entertaining and hilarious flick from the MCU that I enjoyed from what it was. As a Fanboy of these films for 10 years and coming from reading most comics as well, I genuinely found it fun and average despite flaws that are a doubt noticeable. For one, the action sequences were not as much memorable but very enjoyable which not all shine from that with the CGI that looked cool to see. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily were very great in this film, Paul Rudd as Scott lang was as ussual, excellent though I felt the film kind of put aside like a more comedic relief than a hero in this film while Evangeline Lily shining her performance at her role as Hope Van Dyne and Hank Pym played by Michael Douglas was great too. The jokes and humor in this film landed and some didn't, but thanks to Michael Pena's supportive role as Luis in this film, my god I loved this character till the end. Now my flaws wasn't just the villain Ghost who had a very basic backstory and didn't have much to live up to, my real flaw is that the film doesn't explore much into the Quantum Realm and by the last act of the film has some story elements about it that felt lazy and weren't explained well. Overall Ant-man & the Wasp was another genuinely very enjoyable Marvel film, the humor landed but not always, the Villain(s) weren't anything to shine for and felt some other villains could have been forgettable but unfortunately felt like an annoying aspect in the film, CGI looked great, very likable cast but Ant-man & the Wasp didn't feel new and forgettable to it's structure but still had a blast with 7/10"
513,4,"Ant-Man and the Wasp A neat cheap pop-corn flick but nothing more than that. Ant-Man and the Wasp adds nothing substantial or meaningful to the greater Marvel universe and the film itself feels shallow and meaningless. It's got some funny jokes and plots in there, but the stars of the film are the second-tier characters (Louis and Wu really shined throughout the film). It's lead characters feels flat, especially all of Paul Rudd's jokes end up feeling repetitive."
514,8,"Its entertainment value thankfully outweighs the weak plot. 'Ant-Man and The Wasp' tells what is perhaps the lowest-stakes story of the MCU, which is both a good and bad thing. It does feel refreshing that not even a single city is being threatened, and instead the stakes of the story are all personal ones to the characters, however at the same time this gives less urgency to the already weak plot and the fact that there is no real villain doesn't help either. Also there are some characters and side-plots that actually feel rather irrelevant as they are introduced but not explored much. Luckily though, the film is a constantly entertaining one that understands its world, characters and humour. The action sequences are once again wonderfully inventive and the filmmakers are finding ways to make sure that powers of 'Ant-Man and The Wasp' never get old. Also, the cast are all terrific and Christophe Beck manages to deliver another fantastic score that thankfully keeps the great main theme of the original. The film is more enjoyable than the first and while it's not top tier MCU, it comfortably fits in the middle of their repertoire and proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable picture. 7/10"
515,7,"Where the hell is Ant-Man! Well, it wasn't bad at all, but where the hell is Ant-Man! The only thing that made me go to watch this movie is: The suits, action and comedy.... And of course a good story. It was satisfying but some important elements was missing, most one was the suits! But it has a good story, so I liked it. But somehow it was disappointing!"
516,7,Humor and heart Ant man and wasp is a movie that uses humor and heart to hold the movie together. While the story is rushed and not fully explained.
517,8,"A Fun Sequel To Ant-Man Watched Ant-Man And The Wasp Featuring Paul Rudd(Mute) as Scott Lang, Evangeline Lily(The Hobbit:There and Back Again) as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp, Michael Douglas(Wall Street) as Hank Pym, Laurence Fishburne(Man Of Steel) as Bill Foster, Michellle Pfeiffer(Murder On The Orient Express) as Janet Van Dyne and Hannah John-Kamen(Ready Player One) as Ava Starr/Ghost the films villainI thought it was a fun film also Paul Rudd always brings also it was cool seeing Ant-Man have a partner in the film also not to mention the action sequences were fun and the story was simple and too the point as well and better than the Original and Though Hannah John-Karmen had a breakout performance as Ghost I think she stole the show from the rest of the cast overall this was a Fun Sequel to Ant-ManA Fun Sequel To Ant-Man 7/10"
518,8,Great movie with humour This movie has the correct amount of humour that a Marvel should have. You can't exactly have a movie like this that is going to win oscars but it will most definitely keep you entertained for 2 hours. I love Paul Rudd and he plays a great part as Antman. It was slow to start with but once the action started the movie got better and better as it went on. If you're watching it and get abit bored don't turn it off. It's a must watch for the Marvel Universe.
519,7,"A hilarious joy ride, but shallow plot. There are eight writers credited for this film, so it is a bit surprising no risks nor character development occurred in the film. It's a safe, hilarious film that you will enjoy even more as a Marvel fan.I enjoyed it very much, and I think you will as well, but there's nothing you can take home with you from this movie."
520,10,Really loved it! I loved the blend of action and comedy. A fun and entertaining movie!
521,7,Good TV movie? I was bored to death the first half of this movie. It's really a TV Marvel movie that could've went straight to DVD. The costume design seems really basic like somewhat low budget. Maybe it's me. The villain wasn't even a villain and it all comes together like some sort of Spy Kids movie where it's all too suitable for children. The last half was really good and quite funny and entertaining. Clever humor and good effects make it worth watching. It's just passable for a Marvel movie to feel good after the horror infinity war provided on our hearts.
522,8,"Not as emotionally heavy as A:IW, but still great! I saw this last night at the Odeon Luxe in Broadway Plaza, and aside from my dinner at Frankie & Benny's and the luxurious seating, I loved this flick, all the way through!It has: -Good humour -Well-executed action sequences -Compelling storyline -Decent amount of emotional weight -An accurately-animated underwater sequence with Wasp and Ant-Man -A gripping mid-credits sceneI tell ya, I'd watch it again if I could. One of the best films I've seen all year, besides Avengers: Infinity War and Incredibles 2.Definitely recommended for Marvel fans!"
523,10,"Better than the first. I watched this with my girlfriend. She had never seen the first.I fondly remember the first movie being revolutionary, it was a world different from the other MCU movies.After watching this, I went and watched the first again. I have to say I loved the sequel more.This one was compelling and wonderful and also much darker. I especially liked the post credit scene that showed it's links to the MCU.Brilliant, fun and exciting"
524,6,"Better than the original Ant-Man and the Wasp continues the story of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has now spent two years in house arrest after the events of Captain America: Civil War. His sentence is almost at an end, but then he gets contacted by Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), who's researching a way to return her lost mother.While Ant-Man and the Wasp does not break any new ground when it comes to Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's still a solid part of the franchise, and an improvement over the first film. At least in my opinion. The improvements are relatively subtle, but still there. They scaled back the awkward racial stereotypes, made Scott more likable and thus more relatable as a character, gave Hope much more screen time and even the central plot is a tad more interesting - though not by much.Then again, the shrinking effects are not as showy and awe-inspiring as they were in the first film and once again the villain leaves much to be desired. And it's not like this film really needed a supervillain to act as the antagonist. The central conflict did not really need them and I think the film makers could have gotten more out of the interactions and chemistry between Scott and Hope had they had more time to focus on it.The first Ant-Man was, and still is, the one Marvel movie you can easily skip. This unfortunately doesn't break that mold, but as a standalone film it is an improvement. If you've liked the rest of the MCU films, you might as well watch this one."
525,8,"Less ants :( Doesn't have the same fun heist feel as the original, but consider this: 1. More Cassie 2. Academic rivalries turned subplot 3. More Michael Peña narration scenes 4. Evangeline Lilly buff & hot 5. Paul Rudd good dad 6. Michael Douglas better dad now 7. Janet Van Dyne!!!!!! 8. Still some amount of ants 9. Continued good use of the interesting action scene possibilities granted by the Pym particles 10. Michelle Pfeiffer 11. Maybe not the best developed plot, but you're at a Marvel movie. You're not here for a holeless plot. You saw Thanos destroy half the life in the universe in the name of resource management. You're here for ants, and they're here for you.

526,7,"The worlds greatest Grandma........ Scott Lang is grappling with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father.Approached by Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym, Lang must once again don the Ant-Man suit and fight alongside the Wasp.The mission soon leads to secret revelations from the past as the duo find themselves in an epic battle against a powerful new enemy.......After the mentally exhausting Infinity War, it was a good choice for Marvel to release the Ant-Man sequel.Ant-Man clearly is the most tongue in cheek character of the MCU, and in turn, also makes him one of the most human, holistic characters they have in the MCU.Rudd again excels as Lang, so easy to watch, so relatable, alongside Hawkeye, he has the most to lose from a Nuclear family point of view, so even though the film could be classed as a big sigh of relief for the MCU, Lang's quest is still as urgent as any other hero.Although Rudd is hilarious with Pená and friends, and shares some great chemistry with The FBI agent whom is trying to catch him out (their scenes together are the best thing about the film), it's Douglas who steals the film from everyone.He's the funniest thing in the film, delivering line after hilarious line in a dead pan way that's not just hilarious at times, but utterly convincing to the point that you really believe that he is moving a building like a piece of luggage.Set pieces are a little sparse in this, with two really only standing out, but as before, they are inventive and with involving multiple characters, makes it as funny as the first.My only gripe are the antagonists. Goggins is a great character actor, but here he's resorting to Sam Rockwell in Iron Man 2. And the less said about The Ghost, the better. It's a waste of a character, and only seems to be here so Pfeiffer has something to do.Other than that, it's such a fun sequel, with lots of great characters, but maybe it's because it's followed two of the best Marvel films released, it just feels a little lost.But then, there's the Mid-Credit stinger, and in my opinion, it's the best stinger Marvel has done.Which more than makes up for Stan Lees cameo...."
527,5,"Rating: C+ If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)When I look at sequels to superhero origin films, I always seek more. The characters have been introduced, the tone has been established, and the action has reached a certain level of quality. That said, a sequel should offer something more than just a generic story and a cliche villain, it should not feel like a ""filler.""Unfortunately, that is precisely what Ant-Man and the Wasp feels like. A significant portion of this movie's screenplay is lazy as hell. The main plot, as we know from the origin film and from the trailers, is to rescue Hope's mother, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) from the quantum realm. If you think about it just for a minute, you know that this story requires something more because just this plot alone is not enough to make a superhero movie.There is got to be an antagonist of some sorts so we can receive that important genre's action, but this aspect is where the film fails. In the first installment, Corey Stoll portrayed Darren Cross / Yellowjacket as the ""bad guy."" He was just another shallow and cliche character who wanted to make money and ""bla bla bla"". You know the routine. However, the primary goal of an origin movie is to present and build new characters, so they become our heroes. They need to make the audience care for them so they can then make more films. Therefore, the fact that the villain was generic didn't really cause that big of a problem since it served the plot.The same excuse can't be used for a sequel, and Peyton Reed had some struggle with finding the right solution. Walton Goggins as Sonny Burch is so ridiculously expendable that he could have been entirely removed from the story and just by making some small adjustments, it would all flow better. Hannah John-Kamen is actually pretty good as Ghost, and her character has a particularly intriguing backstory. However, she is so horribly explored, and they run over her past like it means nothing to her personality. She had everything to be a great antagonist, but the team of writers did a poorly lazy job.The pacing is also affected by the second act's lack of action. Don't get me wrong, the action is one of the standouts of the movie, I'll get there in a second. Nevertheless, between a terrific action sequence at the beginning of the film and the start of the third act, there is barely any sort of entertainment. Like I wrote above, the main plot by itself does not work since it is based on something that can be easily done if there is no one to cause any problems. Honestly, I got bored for quite a while ...This is where I think this movie is getting some unfair praise. A lot of critics are saying that it is an excellent post-Infinity War film since it is quite light and easygoing. That is not how you approach a movie's analysis. The fact that it got released after or before a certain film has nothing to do with the movie itself. It should be a good film by its own reasons, period. Years from now, if someone wants to pop up Ant-Man and the Wasp because they read or heard it is good, they are not going to be thinking ""oh, I should be depressed and sad since this is after Infinity War. Hey, everyone! You have to be sad to truly enjoy this movie!"". How does this make any sense?!Finally, I only have one more issue (please, don't hit me, I'll get to my pros in an instant). Before the ending, I was pretty much at the limit of giving this film a positive or non-positive review. The reason why I am not going to give it a positive one is due to how they deal with Janet. I can't explain why since it contains massive spoilers, but I'll just say that they expect the audience to simply accept what it is given. They don't justify what happens, not even provide a clue. They just do it. Not only it becomes a plothole (that I'm sure they will fix in a future installment), but it is a bit frustrating that such a potentially exceptional movie can be ruined by such dreadful writing.Ok, time to change the tone of this review. The casting is awesome! Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp is so freaking badass! Honestly, this film should be called The Wasp and Ant-Man because she is definitely the one that commands the movie. Not only she has the best action scenes, but she also gets some well-deserved screentime outside of those. I love that they switched roles a bit and The Wasp became the protagonist, even if sometimes Scott is put aside just a tiny bit too much. I love her interactions with Michael Douglas, who also delivers an outstanding performance.Paul Rudd is fantastic as Ant-Man, and I love the subplot involving him and his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). Abby is super adorable and charming, and every scene that the two of them share is heartwarming. The comedy is on-point, and the big laughs come directly from Michael Peña (Luis) and his colleagues. Every word that comes out of this guy's mouth is pure gold. There is an entire interrogation scene involving him and Goggins' character, which left me laughing for minutes without end. It is truly mind-blowing how a team of writers can develop such funny character's scripts but so careless storytelling.The action is once again unique and exciting. Reed implements the shrinking and growing into the fight sequences, and it is incredible. The car chases are riveting, the initial fight involving The Wasp and some bad guys is astonishing and the third act is filled with fun set pieces. Reed had already proven his worth in directing action, and he does it better now. The editing is really great, and the CGI is top-notch, especially with the de-aging effect in Douglas and Pfeiffer's characters.I do praise the film for being bright and laid-back, the plot is simple to follow, and it is a fun movie overall. It's not better or worse because it was released after Infinity War, it's just an okay film. It was profoundly unexplored, and it had tremendous potential. From Ghost's past to Janet's narrative to Laurence Fishburne's character (Bill Foster) relationship with Hank ... There are a lot of aspects that the movie should have taken advantage of and instead, it just ignores or leaves them underdeveloped.All in all, Ant-Man and the Wasp is an okay MCU ""standalone"" film. It is a fun and relaxed ""filler"" that does not really improve on its origin installment. A terribly unexplored and lazily written screenplay does not help, and the misuse of Ghost is a wasted resource. The awesomeness of Evangeline Lilly as The Wasp is not enough to push back the script's flaws and the tedious second act. While it has a fabulous casting and some phenomenal action sequences, it ultimately fails in giving the audience a decent plot with suitable antagonists. Michael Peña and co. save this movie from a worse review with their hilarious lines."
528,8,"One of the best movies in theaters today! I loved the first one, this one measures up nicely. The same stars are back to shine. The story is funny and moves along nicely. The Marvel stuff is all in order. It has you smiling from the opening scene to the closing credits. SEE THIS MOVIE!"
529,5,"Very average and forgettable The MCU obviously has hits and misses, this film is so incredibly average and meh. It certainly isn't terrible but all opportunities to make it a great film were avoided, instead concentrating on a new set piece for the bigger assembled films. It's such a waste as the actors in this film could have done so much more. Disappointing overall."
530,6,"Fun but dull overall Ant man and the wasp boasts a talented and funny cast which is just about the only thing keeping you from seeing the uninspired directing, thin plot and generic marvel movie story that makes up this movie. Never the less it is an enjoyable 2 hours and isn't short on laughs which are supporated by Paul rudds immaculate comedic ability paired with evangeline Lillys perfect incarnation of the wasp who at times becomes the clear best part of the movie."
531,5,One line Need to pull back on the banter and add some depth.
532,4,"Ant Man and The Wasp - Marvel for a ten-year-old Marvel sequel to a pretty naff 1st movie.Superhero fantasy adventure, the plot revolves around 'The Wasp' character's mother being trapped in something called the quantum realm. She's been stuck for 30 years and needs to be rescued.The best thing is the villain, who is an interesting character. Some comedy sequences but not the level of humour seen in Guardians of the Galaxy or more recently Thor.I couldn't help thinking a ten year old would probably like this. The post credit scene is a dull setup for a 3rd movie. Pretty disappointing."
533,8,"More of what we loved! For starters, how the hell are people giving this a 2 rating?! Really?!I really enjoyed it, more action through out.. more shrinking and added characters and a wider plot leading back to the past (small spoiler).Great from start to finish and 8 in my opinion is this the correct rating.This lives up to the first, some people don't get movies! I will be purchasing on blu ray release!"
534,7,"Antie and Waspie.. We went to see this movie at the weekend.. Short review . It's worth watching. Slightly longer review. An enjoyable Marvel movie aimed more at the younger audience. There is plenty of action and some of the set pieces are actually quite funny. Not as heavyweight as the other recent offerings , but still a good movie. Ignore the reviews that say it's flat , it's not. Perhaps they we're expecting Macbeth? The Ghost character is played by the female lead out of Killjoys. She is OK in this , but much better in Killjoys... In conclusion , a good way to spend a couple of hours with your brain switched off..."
535,5,"Enjoyable yet forgettable This film is actually one of the worst marvel films there is. As a film in general it's good but not great, the shrinking novelty has worn off. There were a couple of laughs but didn't find it that funny or impressive and felt like a churned out sequel which should of been better"
536,5,"Throws ideas at the wall to see what sticks. Sadly, not much does. After the fate-of-the-universe shenanigans of Avengers: Infinity War just three months ago (two months if you live in a country where football isn't that popular), Marvel's twentieth entry into their unstoppable cinematic universe, or MCU, understandably plays the role of palette-cleanser. Infinity War included every Marvel superhero so far, except Hawkeye, and while we still await a solo outing for nobody's favourite Avenger, Ant-Man - who was also absent from the cosmic battle against Thanos - is back for a sequel. The first Ant-Man somehow survived the loss of director Edgar Wright and emerged as a lighter, smaller-scale branch of the ever-expanding MCU. It may have followed the formula of Iron Man's origin very closely, but it was incredibly inventive when its hero suited-up and scaled-down to dodge everything from huge feet pounding a dancefloor, a hungry rat, or the sight of his giant best friend naked. Without the comforts of the origin story however, Ant-Man and the Wasp and returning director Peyton Reed are at a loss which direction to go, and end up throwing multiple storylines at the wall to see what sticks. Sadly, not much does.It's been two years since Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), aka Ant-Man, was drafted into Captain America's crew for a battle against Tony Stark and the Sokovia Accords in Germany. As we saw from the ending of Captain America: Civil War, Lang was imprisoned, but is now being allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest, under the watchful eye of FBI agent Jimmy Woo (a scene-stealing Randall Park). With his new friends off fighting global threats and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) not talking to him for stealing one of his suits, Lang passes the time building huge play-houses for his superhero-obsessed daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), as well as playing drums, watching a lot of television, and crying reading The Fault in our Stars. At night, he is plagued by nightmares of the Quantum Realm, the microscopic world he found himself in during his showdown with Darren Cross, where time and space become irrelevant. He doesn't know it, but Hank and his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) are also thinking about the Realm, in the hope of finding their wife/mother Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), who disappeared thirty years earlier during a mission with her husband. When Lang starts to receive strange messages seemingly from Janet, Pym has no choice but to bring the cat-burglar back into the fold in the hope of nailing her location.The first Ant-Man kept its exposition zippy, sweeping you up into its flow so that all the scientific jibberish being explained simply washed over you. Ant-Man and the Wasp must hold the world record for the number of times the word 'quantum' has been used within two hours. Janet can communicate with Lang through quantum entanglement, where particles interact in ways that essentially make them indistinguishable, even when they are separated by a huge distance. The film's 'villain', Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) experiences molecular instability due to an accident during a quantum experiment, meaning that she can phase through solid matter at will. At one point, Lang questions if the boffins tasked with explaining all of this to us simply put the word 'quantum' in front of everything. This is played for laughs, but doesn't necessarily absolve the film of the problem. Also thrown into the mix is slimy businessman Sonny Burch, played by a wasted Walton Goggins, who wants his greedy hands of Pym's tech and will stop at nothing until he has it. For a series that now prides itself on a lighter tone, it's a lot of plot to take in. The trippy Quantum Realm was teased in the first Ant-Man, and it remains a tease here. There's literally a whole new world to explore at sub-atomic level, yet it remains a frustrating mystery.While there's way too much going on plot-wise, Ant-Man and the Wasp doesn't disappoint with its set-pieces. As glimpsed in the trailer, the heroes turn everything from a salt-shaker to a Hello Kitty pez dispenser into a weapon, normally hurled at their enemies and used to block their path. With her ability to fly and shoot from the wrist, Wasp gets to kick the most ass, dispensing a vehicle full of baddies with speed and efficiency, and all brought to life with stunning special effects. Lang's motor-mouthed associate Luis (Michael Pena) also returns for a beefier part, with his gift for story-telling once again proving a highlight. Laurence Fishburne helps establish some gravitas whenever he is on screen as Bill Foster, Pym's former co-worker on the G.O.L.I.A.T.H. project and whose existence was teased as far back as Iron Man 2. It's ultimately two hours of fluff and Peyton Reed (along with his five writers, including Rudd) knows it, and while this was very much part of the character's charm the first time around, many jokes here fall flat. There are nice touches, such as Pym's laboratory, populated by giant ants carrying out maintenance work and tiny objects blown up in size stitching the whole thing together, which can be shrunken down to luggage size with the click of a button. Lang's relationship with his daughter is also very touching. But Reed never fully commits to one idea and refuses to run with the many promising ideas the film touches on. With the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok willing to embrace the crazy, Ant-Man and the Wasp was always going to pale in comparison."
537,6,"Quantum of Solace ""Ant-Man And The Wasp"" comes as a palate cleanser following the events of Infinity War. Wisely setting the story prior to the events of the last Marvel film, we find Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) under house arrest following his plea deal for his part in the events show in ""Captain America: Civil War"". Abandoned by Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne for stealing the AntMan suit for his amateur Avengering, Scott re-establishes contact when Pym's experiments with accessing the Quantum Realm produces a link between him and Hope Van Dyne, (Michelle Pfeiffer) the original Wasp lost there many years ago.""It was alright"" was my overriding thought at the conclusion of ""AntMan And The Wasp"". It's slight and relatively inconsequential to the universe as a whole, but it has to be - as we're effectively on hold until the MCU narrative kicks off again with Avengers 4. Despite Rudd, and his reliable comic timing and affable style ""Antman 2"" is not as funny as either of the Guardians films, ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" or the universes comedic highspot, ""Thor Ragnorok"". I feel like a lot of the character moments in the film fell a bit flat. The chemistry is there between Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly and with his on screen daughter. . I just didn't buy it anywhere else. Unfortunately, this continues with the villains of the piece, Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost is perhaps too sympathetic to root against - and Walton Coggins black market science dealer feels like a low rent version of The Vulture, and never of any real threat to either antagonist or the protagonists.After that, I feel that I should reiterate... I felt it was alright, not bad, just not great. The effects are pretty amazing though both with shrinking and growing, the de-aging scenes for multiple characters and with Ghost's phasing in and out of reality. The action scenes are first class too, both fighting and the car chases. I did laugh a few times too, often inspired by Michael Pena's return as Luis, so it's not a totally comedic failure.I hope that Ant-Man does have a role to play in Avengers 4 (I presume he must from the post Credits scene) but I feel I'd like a different creative force behind the film for Ant-Man 3, just to freshen it up in the way Taika Waititi did with ""Ragnorok""."
538,8,"Classic MCU, bright and well done. This being the nine billionth MCU installment, we knew we were going to get an upbeat and good blockbuster movie. But this was also well done and unlike the last several installments, was classic MCU. It was refreshing.The performances were good. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily ooze charisma and their chemistry is incomparable. Michael Douglas remains funny while serious as he is and Laurence Fishbourne plays off him quite well. I can't remember Ghost's actress' name, but she did manage to bring some humanity to a bad guy and made the character sympathetic, which I appreciated. The standout was the kid that played Ant-Man's daughter. Her giddiness was unmatchable and enjoyable.The writing was nothing special, which I would normally have a problem with, but it'll be understood why I don't this time around soon. It was a simple tale and does indeed have some of the best timed comedy in the MCU.Peyton Reed loves to play with size and maneuverability. It shows (and works!). The direction makes this film so much fun. 'Nuff said.What deserves praise in this film is the visual design. Not only the shrinking and the way that size is played with, but the way certain places are visually constructed.Classic MCU, Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) is bright and well done. 8/10"
539,10,"Great Fun If you do not like this movie, then you do not like fun. Yes it is a little sappy at moments. But it is so much fun. It is a good pick me up after Infinity War. Marvel is great at adjusting its tone. You can tell if someone has a stick up their butt. It is anyone that did not like this movie. The can say it is just not for them. That would be fair. No movie is for everyone.This movie has everything a movie really should have. It takes you out of the mundane and into another universe. You can escape your day to day life and just be a kid again. These movies are about the only thing in this modern age that I would like to have had in my childhood. I am glad I can see these movies with my kids and just have a good time."
540,8,"Not bad......not good, but not bad 3 August 2018 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Ant Man and The Wasp. So we journey into the world of Ant Man once again. I am a big fan of Marvel and DC, and even the bad films will get my time. This film wasn't bad, it was entertaining, it kept me interested, there were some great effects, I loved everything changing size all the time. However I felt the storyline was a little weak and the comedy of the first film was just not there. We had a bad guy who was chasing the good guys all through the film and if he wasn't there, the film would still get to its conclusion in the same amount of time. We did however get some great action from Ant Man and The Wasp themselves and several fabulous car chases involving varying sized vehicles and people. Michael Douglas was great as Dr Hank Pym and there were several amusing one liners. Once again people it's Marvel, don't leave until the very end."
541,4,"Meh Not good, not bad. Your kids will love it. I thought it was mediocre cash grab. Adds nothing to the mcu."
542,8,Just go and see it for the after credit ending #antmanandthewasp 8/10 another good addition to the #marvel movies. It's not their best but I preferred it to the first one very funny and good action movie. The ending after the credits is brilliant worth going to see it just for that.....was great fun in #4DX
543,7,"Not f-ant-astic, but not average either - slipping into the quantum level's inbetween those two Directed by Peyton Reed, this 2018 film adds to, and expands on Ant-Man's role in the Marvel cinematic universe.Picking up about 2-3 years after ""Captain America 3 - Civil War"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is back as Ant-Man. His exploits in Civil War left him in some serious bother with homeland security, as a result he's been tagged and under house arrest. His connections to Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope Van-Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) are off-limits, but they aren't in talks anymore as he apparently didn't inform or consult them before his exploits in Civil War - so they are upset he took the suit and got caught. One day, Scott has a dream where he sees Janet Van-Dyne (Michelle Pheiffer) in the Quantum zone, which coincides with an experiment Hank and Hope have done. It seems they need each other more than ever - and thus another Ant-Man adventure starts off. This time he's got Hope fighting alongside him; she's been given a suit too which allows her to follow in her mother's footsteps, much like Scott is following in Hank's footsteps.This is a very light and family friendly film, much like the first film and even more so than the likes of Thor Ragnorak - which, let's be honest, was practically a comedy-action film rather than a straight up superhero fantasy film. I guess with Disney behind the ownership it was always going to be a light version of Ant-Man, so if you've come to see some of the exploits from the comics you'll be sorely disappointed - Hank Pym is an alcoholic who domestically abuses his family, Scott isn't entirely a bad guy looking out for himself, Janet isn't flirting with the first person to show her attention. The film follows Ant-Man and the Wasp as they try their best to decode the message from Janet, while staying out of reach of the authorities, out of reach of the bad guys, and one step ahead of the villain - Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). I FTR have to be honest here, the portrayal of Ghost is a massive let down for me, because I really like the comic version. On the flipside, Ghost is a better villain then Yellow-Jacket (Corey Stoll) was in the first film, so there a slight improvement here. More humour than action, but not on the same level as other Marvel films this can still be an enjoyable ride. For the Marvel fanboys/girls this does answer some questions brought up by Infinity War, but they might want to consider this a filler story in the bigger, grittier universe. Michael Peña is great comic relief, although it's not entirely needed with everyone else playing fun roles. Goggins plays a role that could have been easily excluded from the role, but you know as soon as he's on screen that he's going to be the slapstick bad guy - and that he's been added to add an element of chaos and hopefully another dimension so the action isn't flat. The pace of the film is good and generally the plot is too - albeit sometimes the dialogue is delivered at hundreds of miles an hour to make the science less daunting - which I'm sure younger audiences will blank out anyway in favour of funny giant ants attacking people.All in all this film is pretty much what you'd expect having watched the first film, unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new - other than a positive female role for Marvel, with the Wasp being touch and intelligent. As such, I'm going to give this exactly the same rating as the first film, which was 7 out of 10."
544,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp The first movie in the continuing Marvel Universe was good fun and did reasonably well at the box office, a sequel was probably expected, and I hoped that it could be even better, directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love, The Break-Up, Yes Man). Basically in 1987, Janet Van Dyne aka the Wasp (Michelle Pfeiffer) shrank between the molecules of a Soviet nuclear missile, it was disabled, but she became trapped in the sub-atomic quantum realm, her husband Dr. Hank Pym aka the original Ant-Man (Michael Douglas) raised their daughter Hope, believing that Janet is dead. Years later, former criminal Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has taken the mantle to become Ant-Man, but since secretly helping Captain America during the skirmish between the Avengers, he is under house arrest, while Pym and Hope (Lost's Evangeline Lilly) are in hiding and have cut ties with Scott. Two years on, Scott has a realistic dream about the quantum realm, and he sees Janet, with whom he is quantumly entangled, he gives Pym a call to tell him about it. Hope kidnaps Scott, leaving a decoy, a giant ant, to mimic Scott's movements, so as not to arouse the suspicion of the FBI and agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park). Seeing the dream as a message and a confirmation that Janet is alive, Pym and Hope work to create a tunnel stable enough to launch a vehicle into the quantum realm and rescue Janet. There is one part required to complete the tunnel, Hope arranges to meet black market dealer Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) to buy it, but he knows the potential profit that could be earned from Pym and Hope's research. Burch double-crosses them, Hope, as the Wasp, fights him and his men off, until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman, Scott, as Ant-Man tries to help fight off this ""ghost"", but she escapes with Pym's portable lab. Pym reluctantly visits his estranged former partner Dr. Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) who helps them locate the lab. The ghost restrains Scott, Hope, and Pym when they arrive, she reveals herself to be Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen), her father Elihas (Michael Cerveris), another former partner of Pym's, accidentally killed himself during a quantum experiment, which resulted in Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that he has been helping Ava, they are planning to cure her, using Janet's quantum energy, Pym refuses to help them, believing that this will kill Janet, the trio manage to escape. With the needed part, the tunnel is now stable, Pym and Hope are able to contact Janet, who through Scott communicates her precise location, but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Burch learns their location from Scott's business partners Luis (Crash's Michael Peña), Dave (Tip ""T.I."" Harris), and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Scott, who rushes home before Woo can see him breaking his house arrest, leaving Pym and Hope to be arrested, and for their lab to be taken by Ava. Scott is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Pym decides to take the risk to enter the quantum realm, Scott and Hope distract Ava while he does so, but the pair also have to fight Burch and his men. Luis, Dave, and Kurt help apprehend Burch, allowing Pym to successfully find Janet, and Scott and Hope manage to stop Ava before she can take Janet's energy. Pym and Janet safely return from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilise her. Scott returns home, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest, while Ava and Foster go into hiding. In the mid-credits sequence, Pym, Hope, and Janet send Scott into the quantum realm to harvest quantum energy to continue helping Ava, but before they can bring Scott back, Pym, Hope, and Janet all disintegrate (the ending of Avengers: Infinity War), leaving Scott drifting. Also starring Bobby Cannavale as Jim Paxton, Judy Greer as Maggie, Abby Ryder Fortson as Cassie and Stan Lee as Shrunken Car Man. Rudd is much more convincing this time as the leading hero with deadpan quips, Lilly gets more time on screen as the second hero of the piece, Douglas remains good as the wise scientist, Pfeiffer is good but limited for obvious reasons, and the supporting cast are all good too. The story is more though-out, much slicker and wittier than perhaps previously, and the special effects are even better, much more shrinking and growing this time, and fantastic fast-paced chase and fight sequences, and funny stuff as well, a really fun superhero action adventure. Very good!"
545,7,"ANT MAN SCORES!!! the movie is a gigantic adventure in a small city Armed with a good script ant man and the wasp gambles with the idea of a sequel to the Ant man (2015) , with the first movie amassing positive critic reviews and box office success naturally the jinx shadows a sequel. the ant man and the wasp team seem to broken Jinx effect of sequels not standing up to the original movie.The script is very well written with a prime focus on character development and tons of humour. If you are a fan michael pena ,u will absolutely love him in this character,he is a capable actor with accolades for roles in drama and comic category. Paul rudd seems to have gotten into the roots of the character for ant man ,he is the perfect choice to play a washed up dad trying to save the world .evangeline lily brings in the charm and great acting to the movie. there are a lot of characters adding up to the humour quotient for the movie, the Movie doesn take itself too seriously and gives the audience a smart,funny and visual treat. walton,bobby cannavale,judy,T.I ,dastmalachian all do justice to their roles. although we see very less of them. douglas,fishbourne,pfeiffer they are good actors who withstand the test of time and the script.the score is fast paced and fits the pacing of the movie.peyton reed has justified the slow start if the movie with a lot of action nd humour. once again the protogonist back story and character development is underwhelming. ghost screentime is minimalist and is forgettable.this movie is meant for audience of all age groups,children will love the speciall effects and the adventure while the adults can also enjoy the hunour and great story telling.this is movie for family and fans over a long weekend. go for it."
546,3,"Meh! A big disappointment! I loved the first movie and was looking forward to seeing where they took this. The plotline was really weak, and scripting poor - any funny moments and themes from the first installment were wheeled back out but very much forced this time. Just a big fat fail I'm sorry."
547,3,nearly fell asleep Quite possibly the worst Marvel film made. Very disappointing
548,10,Fantastic movie for the family The whole concept and the plot is entertaining. Those who are bored with such movies should avoid marvel altogether.My kids and I liked it very much.
549,6,"Refreshingly lighter than Infinity War - but still should have dreamed ""bigger"" TL;DREnjoyable, but doesn't stand a chance compared to Marvel's last three - Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity WarSimple story without a solid villainLess identity than the first film---------------------------------There's no denying that Marvel are on top of their game as of late; let's think back to their last three films - Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War... These were all huge splashes in cinema, the latter two in particular. Now, after the enormous events of Infinity War, we needed something lighter and more easy-going. Fortunately, we have Ant-Man and the Wasp, a film that is noticeably more relaxing. Still, following such incredible and unique films, this one seems a little too formulaic and small, but nevertheless enjoyable.At first I thought it was because we've just come from Thanos, but regardless of that it's still noticeable that there's a lack of a real villain. Yes, we have Ava/ Ghost and Sonny Burch, but Sonny seems more like a low-key gangster and Ava's intentions are hardly evil or malevolent. Without a real antagonist, it all seems a lot lighter with lower stakes. After all, as Roger Ebert said, a film is only ever as good as the villain... Instead, the story focuses more on their search for Janet, with various people getting in the way. But even then it's not as if the film has a solid identity like the first one; whereas Ant-Man could be described as a heist movie, it's difficult to say what Ant-Man and the Wasp could be described as - a recue movie...maybe?Still, although the story may be a little too much on the light side, it's never boring. There are plenty of laughs (as we've come to expect from Marvel) and lots of fun action. The best thing about Ant-Man is the opportunity of having more imaginative action scenes we haven't seen before. Cars constantly shrinking and growing as they race through San Francisco is the sort of fresh new action we need. What's best, though, is when the comedy and action come together; last time we had an enormous Thomas the Tank Engine run rampage, this time we have a dangerously large Hello Kitty Pez flying towards the bad guys. And with regards to fighting, if anything the highlight of the action comes from Evangeline Lilly's Wasp, whose smooth fighting skills beat Scott's any day and are an absolute blast to watch.Comedy perhaps goes a little too far with Peña's Luis, forcing in the same sort of inane jabbering monologues from the first film. If anything, I would prefer less Luis and more from the other members of X-Con. It would have also been better to see more of Fishburne's Bill Foster and particularly John-Kamen's Ghost, whose performance was finely balanced between charismatic and likable to manic and desperate. Michelle Pfeiffer, however, is by far the most underused aspect of the film. To have an actress like Pfeiffer in the cast and to only use her sparingly as merely a MacGuffin seems mad, especially when she seems like an absolutely perfect Janet Van Dyne; glamorous, caring and determined. The heart of the film though is still with Hank and the titular duo. As with the first film, Douglas manages to make Hank likable despite his brusque manner. But it's Rudd and Lilly who carry the film - as you would imagine they should judging from the title. Their banter retains its charm from the first, although it would have benefitted from more chemistry and to explore their relationship more deeply. Still they fight well together, talk well together and make a good team.I feel quite sorry for director Peyton Reed. There's no doubt that we needed a breath of fresh air after the intensity of Infinity War - and this is it. In comparison to the recent Marvel films, this one never stood a chance of reaching those heights. Though it seems a little too light and formulaic, lacks a solid villain and should have dreamed bigger (pun intended), Ant-Man and the Wasp is still a decent and enjoyable Marvel film to keep us going until next year."
550,10,"I loved it It was great, perhaps even better than the first, lots of humour, lots of character development, great action, and giant worker ants were the icing on the cake."
551,2,Snooze fest I actually fell asleep for half of it.... that is all...
552,8,Excelsior! More Wasp! More Hank Pym! And a great supporting cast. That's all I wanted but there was more. The comedy was still good and Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lily just showed why Hank Pum is not to be trifled with. Great choice on Michelle Pfieffer. For Michael Douglas: You're never too old to kill it in a super hero suit! Hope to more of you and Evangeline Lily in the MCU.
553,3,"Total narrative failure What happened to a good story and character development? Constant big, small, normal, micro, quantum. Pathetically the whole story relies on impossible size shifting and nonsense neo-science garbage talk to explain it. It even had product placement, and the local cine-plex even subjected me to 15 minutes of planet killing car ads before the main feature. I just feel they missed a trick not advertising industrialized beef patties and rainforest timber wardrobes. I fell asleep in a dystopian nightmare for 15 minutes in the middle.This garbage would have been satire 30 years ago. This film is in the same vein as Transformers, for children or the incredibly dumb, to make incredibly wealthy people even wealthier. Like pop music, the function of this movie isn't to be good, but make money. If you're over 16 or maybe 15 avoid this drivel."
554,8,"Nice change of pace from Infinity Wars I write a lot of reviews, for the most part I do quite badly apparently because my review for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Infinity War both are said to be unhelpful. Meanwhile, the lead one here has missing punctuation, is not even a complete paragraph and seems to be written in broken English and has over 129 people saying it is helpful. This site is full of strange people, this film is also strange and rather good and funny. It is a nice change of pace from Infinity War (which I did love btw) in that the plot in this one does not revolve around a super villain with a plan that can doom us all. Some may complain about the villain's motives, but seriously, in the comic books not every story revolved around villains plotting to take over the world.The story has Ant-man, Scott, is under house arrest due to his part in Civil War. He passes his time helping his friend with his business and frittering away his day. That is, until he has a dream that makes him call Hank Pym who has been on the run thanks to Scott using his Ant-man suit during the Civil War. Hank quickly retrieves Scott because Scott may hold key information in finding Hank Pym's wife in the metaverse. Unfortunately, there are others interested in Hank Pym's tech and a strange new villain also wants her hands on Hank Pym's technology! Thankfully, Scott has an ally to fight alongside as Hank Pym's daughter Hope has now taken the mantle of the Wasp!The movie was good for the most part, but the Ant-man films do seem to trend more on the comedy side of things. Which is kind of a good thing after the ending of Infinity War. My main complain about this one has to do with Scott being under house arrest in this one. He was locked in a cell in a special prison at the end of Civil War and it made it look like Captain America was going to break them free. Yet, here he is just stuck in his house...seems like his sentence was kind of light considering and did Cap not break him out?So I enjoyed this film, it has some action, but it did seem to trend to more of a comedy. The effects were good and like all the movies in the Marvel Comic Universe, this film does have a scene that ties this one into the other films in the series. I like the characters in this series, but I kept wondering if they had replaced the actress who played Hope in the first movie because she looked different to me. Apparently, it was the same actress, but she totally looked like a different person to me! Anyways, a nice addition to the MCU and I look forward to seeing Ant-man again!"
555,5,Poor by marvel standards This film is poor by marvel standards. Lacked a villian with a decent motive and wasnt even funny. Stella cast but the story really didnt do them justice. Is on par with thor and thor 2. Maybe the third instalment will follow the path of thor 3 which was actually one of marvels best films.
556,8,"World's Best Grandma! Ant Man was a surprise to everyone. It was a tiny, fun sized, action packed, comedic film marvel needed to break up from the over turning of dramatic super hero films (Not that that's a bad thing). The sequel to Ant Man continues the trend the first one had with a little less worry about fitting into the core 6 storylines. Wasp is a great addition to the film and the MCU, and the film ties well into Infinity War, answering most of your questions as to where Scott was and now leaves you wondering what will happen next.It's meant to be a fun time and is a good superhero film that should be seen as a popcorn action comedy that is just meant to be a good time.Not as good as sequels like Winter Soldier or Thor Ragnarok but still offers the audience a fun time."
557,10,Loved it! So great to see this cast together again!! Loved the storyline. It was pure fun!
558,6,"The low end of a Marvel movie This only just came out in the UK, so well done me for avoiding spoilers around my American friends for a full month. I'm a big Marvel fan, and never seem to be disappointed with what they come out with, maybe except for the lack of actually good action in Spiderman: Homecoming. But this lacks in all 3 fields. The way I see Marvel movies, they are composed of 3 different areas; comedy, action and critical quality. The best ones are those that excel in at least two of those fields, for example Civil War, which had great action and critical quality due to it's character development and intriguing story, or of course, Infinity War, which smashed all 3 fields (though I still think it is way overrated). This movie was somewhat funny; like Homecoming, it had a side character with lots of wit. But he's not quite up to the same standard and is not half as prominent. The action is barely there, and when it is there it has an oversaturated use of the shrink and grow abilities, which you get bored of and it never attempts to show off any real good had to had combat, like what was in the first movie. Actually, a lot of the comedy feels ripped from Ant Man 1, with a lot of the jokes composing of zooming out the camera to show how pathetic the action looks from a normal person's view. And its critical value is very low. There is little to no character development, and every character feels formed to be completely generic. The sudden change in Ghost's personality at the end is so stupid. The final fight is boring and feels like something that needs a little Deus Ex Machina. And the post-credits scene feels like a forced and confusing way to both explain where Scott was in Infinity War and to leave the internet open to lots of theories. Probably Marvel's lowest point since 2015."
559,4,"Not great I think that Hannah John-Kamen was the best thing in this movie. I really liked her character and she did it really well. Het character was the only one i could actually feel empathy for. She was complex and cool. Unlike ant-man himself, who was flat and not interesting. Most character where just there for the comedy. And that's just annoying.The movie overall was predictable and a little lame. Some of the jokes where good. But most of them just made my eyes roll instead of make me laugh. While i mostly love the comedy in Marvel movies. But this time it made the whole movie a little hard to watch."
560,5,"As mediocre and forgettable as the first one. Good job!? The movie gives you exactly what it promises. Something of a filler movie as competent and bland as the first one. Some things are exactly the same: Michael Peña has basically the same screen time, with the same jokes. The villain is again a problem. In the first one, it was the typical Marvel villain. Same powers, different color, wants money and power because he's a greedy capitalist that doesn't care about people.We are going to get some inside in the systemic industrial military complex? Nope. Too real. Lets just make one dude particularly evil. In this one, you have TWO horrible villains and its great because here, one its the typical greedy villain but has no powers, and the other has powers but its not greedy! Art people, Art.Henry Pym is still kind of a prick. Scott Lang is way dumber. The Wasp is perfect.Peña might not be good enough to have a bigger role, but I can't stop thinking that a bit more of him would go a big way into making this at least a good comedy."
561,8,"Loved the levity You have to hand it to Marvel Studios: it's nailing the combination between the action, plot and dialogue in ""Ant-Man 2."" This sequel is a delight in knowing that humor goes a long way in messaging the comic-book atmosphere. Having Stan Lee, who was responsible in bringing Marvel Comic characters into existence, in a cameo, was brilliant. Worth going to. You'll love it."
562,7,"Fairly good 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' was a pleasant ride of a film and was mostly entertaining. The story set following the events of 'Civil War' is action packed from the get go and further develops the majority of the cast. The 'team-ups' of sorts between the individuals are fun to see and more often than not are quite hilarious. The villains are well crafted (nothing too fantastic though) and interesting but are most importantly impactful to the plot. With moments that are sad and heartfelt, great pieces of physical comedy and action, fantastic character and a perhaps crucial link to the wider MCU this sequel is arguably better than the first and is worth your time"
563,8,Decent effort I really enjoyed this film good script and good overall acting. Better then the first ant man and great add on to the marvel franchise
564,5,"What do you expect? Its a below average Marvel movie What can i really add but, its just another Marvel movie that dont get me wrong it has stunning visuals However its just another movie to bank into the MCU, i cant remember anything about AntMan 1 and dont expect the same with this film in the next 6 months. The story is very meh and did annoy me a lot a times. Overall i wasnt excited to see the film at all, its a film that would be enjoyed by the main Marvel fan base, see it in 3D in cinema if you are going to see it as it does have scenes that will work very well. Its a below average Marvel movie- 5/10"
565,7,Not horrible but not great It was simply an enjoyable movie with all the comedic elements you expect from Ant Man. Better than Black Panther imo.
566,6,"Large and Small on screen, but just ends up middling. In a prologue we see a young Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) torn apart as Janet miniturises herself into the ""quantum realm"" to save the world from nuclear disaster. But in the present day Hank thinks there might be a way to find and retrieve Janet with the help of their superhero daughter Hope (""The Wasp"", played by Evangeline Lilly). (""What the f*** have you been thinking about instead for the last 30 years while I've been sat here avoiding neutrons"", would be the imagined response from Janet, but we don't go there!).But Scott Lang (aka ""Ant Man"", Paul Rudd), having also been to the quantum realm, holds a key part of the puzzle. To add to their problems, a strange ghost-like girl called Ava has her own reasons for retrieving the lost soul, but in ways that will tear Janet limb from limb. Can Hank, Hope and Scott succeed, while dodging both The Ghost, the FBI and other criminal forces intent on seizing Pym's technology?I must admit that I'd somewhat forgotten how ""Ant Man"" ended three years ago, which together with the one film missing from my Marvel-watching canon being ""Captain America: Civil War"" left me somewhat confused by why we start the film with our hero Lang under two-year's house arrest. But much fun is had with Lang's curfew and the frustration of FBI agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) in trying to catch him breaking the rules.For we are again at the comedic end of the Marvel universe. However the comedy is extremely uneven this time and doesn't sit particularly well with the dramatic and emotional elements of the film. It's certainly nowhere near the consistently funny content of the surprisingly good ""Thor: Ragnarok"". Some of Rudd's lines just smell of ""trying too hard"".Adding comedic value is Michael Peña returning here as Scott's partner Luis. His motor-mouth routine after taking a truth drug (""not a truth drug""!) was hilarious, with the rest of the cast miming his words in flashback.It has to be said though that there are some truly great sight-gags, to rival the Thomas the Tank Engine scenes in the first film. The expanding salt-cellar; the expanding / contracting car and building moments; and the ""skateboard"" scenes. But all - and I mean ALL - of these scenes were universally spoiled by the trailer, such that the reaction to them was ""oh, that's that bit then"". NEVER has there been a better case for a teaser trailer that basically said ""Ant Man's back; here's ONE wow-factor visual"". It's just criminal. Interestingly, re the trailer, there was also at least one scene (the ""you go high, I'll go low"" one, which I thought was very funny) that didn't make the cut I saw.Acting wise you can't fault the cast with Lilly just great as ""The Wasp"". It's also great to see Michael Douglas and Laurence Fishburne going head-to-head in the acting stakes. Walton Goggins again crops up as a believable bad-guy, a performance I really enjoyed, but the star turn for me in the whole film was a career-making performance by Hannah John-Kamen as Ava/The Ghost: she's previously only had small supporting roles in ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Ready Player One"". Looking like a Star Wars sand-person in her outfit she removes her mask to reveal a stunningly piercing gaze and great screen presence. One to watch for the future.Directed by original ""Ant Man"" director Peyton Reed, it's a perfectly entertaining watch for a summer night, but it is uneven in tone, perhaps the result of the team of five credited with the writing. Ask me in two months' time to tell you anything about it and I will probably struggle. It's a ""meh"" sort of film for me."
567,5,Quantum theory exemplified. It's an insult to quantum realm. One will feel ant-man and wasp are building tension to mate in quantum realm.
568,8,"Just like the first one If any of you have read my review for the first you might have notice me mentioning that it wasn't the best movie of the MCU I have watched but it was good. As it had some funny and memorable characters like Louise and the rest of Scott Lang's friends. Well it is the same scenario with this one.It did have good acting and somewhat better from the first one and it did sort of make sense on why Ant-Man wasn't in Infinity Wars. Don't skip the first post credit scene however, I only stayed for the first one as I was in a massive rush when I was at the cinema hall. It was also nice seeing Paul Rudd as Ant-Man again as he is one of the best spotlight actors from this movie.However, the only things which I didn't like about this movie were the fact that it was only two hours long, Hope for some reason having longer all of a sudden and believe it or not I was expecting to see Hawkeye in the movie since him and were absent from Infinity Wars and they were shown to be good friends after Civil War so I thought he might have had some contribution to this movie.But other then that it's a good movie if you enjoyed the first one."
569,10,Best movie of the year!!! I love Ant Man and the Wasp! The sequel of it is more funnier than the original one. I love the part when Luis and his gang use truth serum on the bad guys and turn them over to the police. I'm also happy that Hank's wife is alive! Scott is one of the funniest characters in this movie!
570,6,"Maybe slightly better than the first one? Strangely I was actually quiet interested in seeing this film, considering its an MCU film. There usually not my thing, way too much humour and the films can be predictable. However the trailers for this film got me actually interested in seeing a MCU film for quiet some time, I personally thought the first film was ok nothing amazing but an entertaining watch. After viewing this one I'd say I slightly enjoyed this one better.Overall the cast is really good all round, there are a couple of standouts. Firstly Evangeline Lilly who as Wasp I thought was the best and strongest part of the film, her story with her father progresses really nicely in the film as does the relationship with Ant-man himself. I'd say its more her movie than Ant-mans' in a way, she is the heart of the story, trying to find her mother. Most of the fantastic actions scenes involve her. Character arc throughout is really nicely done. The other standout of the film is Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. I don't know why but I was surprised at how much more he had to do in this film and he was obviously brilliant in the role, really built off from the first film. Has a really good relationship with Evangeline Lilly throughout the film, the chemistry between the two actors is so good that you believe they are father and daughter.Strangely even though he was good I don't think that there was any massive improvement or anything special from Paul Rudd as Ant-man, still really good but nothing that sticks out in the film. Hannah John-Karmen, Laurence Fishburne, Michelle Pfeiffer and Micheal Pena are also strong and charismatic in their roles.The action overall is really bold and imaginative, Peyton Reed really dived head first into the effects that could be used during the action scenes. It was new and a fresh take on the type of action that could be created. The changes in the sizes of the characters as well as items or vehicles around them all made for a really entertaining watch.Unfortunately as with pretty much every MCU film I have the same criticism over and over again, I am a stuck record. I am in the huge minority but once again there is far too much humour in this film, I don't mind humour in the film but it has to be at the right moment and earned. With this film and many others in the MCU it is overloaded with humour. For example Micheal Pena is a great actor I really like him, he is actually quiet good in the film however they just used his characters humour too much. Towards the end of the film it gives becomes a joke fest, its just not needed. Oh well.......thats the mini rant over.Overall I think the film is ok/average but slightly better that the first one, 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out of 10. The acting across the board is good with an interesting villain in Ghost that is not wasted and has real motivations. Action is really different and fresh to the genre, but the film overall is just fine nothing mind blowing or makes me really want to watch it again. In a strange way Im slightly disappointed because I thought I'd like it more. I don't know really its just your run of the mill average MCU film, nowhere near the level of ""Winter Solider""."
571,6,"Plenty Action but please no more sequels Not bad for a Marvel movie. Definitely not better than previous/first one. Wasp stole show as she has more appeal as a hero. Script missing humor and exchanges first movie marveled at (excuse the pun, lol).Hope they don't try to blend these characters into the Avengers but it's probably inevitable since Ant-man already had limited roles before, sigh..."
572,5,"The movie was the trailer I know it is often the case, but I had here absolutely no suprise watching the movie compare to the first in the series and other Marvel."
573,5,"Plain and mildly entertaining. The movie was OK overall, humor seems to be a point being brought up a lot, mostly that theres more of it. Whilst that might be true, it was all a bit predictable.The storyline was just bad however. As soon as the main plot was revealed, it was obvious how it was going to end. Sadly a bad enter into the line of Marvel movies of which Im such a fan."
574,8,"Enjoyed it I really love Paul Rudd, and I think he makes the movie way better than it is. Him and Michael Pena, who steals all his scenes. Ant Man isn't my favorite, but I think it's better than the first one, and if you just go in looking for a good time you won't be disappointed."
575,8,"Great Fun! Ant-Man and the Wasp: Fun, action and joke filled sequel as much of a blast as Deadpool 2 but these jokes are kid friendly. We even get a pastiche of the Bullitt car chase along San Francisco hills as vehicles change sizes and a large Ant-Man uses a truck as a scooter. Michael Douglas relives his Streets Of San Francisco role as he spends so much time behind the wheel of a van he looks like a cop on a stakeout.Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is under house-arrest after his shenanigans with Captain America but he must sneak out to aid Howard Pym (Douglas) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lily) as they attempt to build a quantum tunnel to rescue her mother from the Quantum realm. They encounter Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) a former SHIELD scientist and clash with the molecularly unstable Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen).Giant ants abound, drumming, working in the lab, being used as muscle. The lab is shrunk and may be carried around like an attache case. Hope comes into her own as the Wasp with wings, not needing a flying ant like Ant-Man does. Indeed Ant-Man loses quite a few flying ants to seagulls in the film. A riot of laughter. 8/10."
576,5,"Worst marvel movie out This movie was just so incredibly boring and all over the place. I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish or solve or how in any way, other than the post credit scene, this film relates to MCU. Love Paul Rudd but he's Paul Rudd, antman is just Paul Rudd. I think my favorite part of this movie was when they referenced Captain America and Civil War."
577,7,"Marvel you may be losing me SPOILER ALERT: ENDING DISCUSSED. Marvel I'm getting a bit bored and alienated by your movies. Ant Man and the Wasp should be a self contained movie but we had e bit at the end that brought Thanos into it. Why??? Because it's the same ""universe""? I don't care. I've sat through countless re-imagining movies, such as Spiderman or Star Trek, and I'm willing to consider that, on a case by case basis. Continuity is not a God. Accuracy in Hollywood movies?? Really! Watch any historical movie then go find out what really happened. I was shocked to find that Avengers Infinity War was ""continued next year"" and not only that but you have to bring it in to Ant Man.Look this isn't Stanley Kubrick territory. It's meant to a an enjoyable movie and to some extent it is. You try to get a lot of jokes in there, like the ""X-Con"" security company and you have the X-Con guys be funny some of the time and then become the heroes at others. This switch is hard to do and you don't do bad. The heroes, Ant Man, Wasp etc, are likeable, funny at times and dedicated. The villains are not too bad. The jokes are not too bad.Overall, you've got a good movie but not a great movie. Worth watching but if you then have to pull this ""connect to the Marvel Universe"" stuff you may lose me. If you give me a good but not great movie and then add an ending I don't like then I'll be less inclined to watch the next one. I may be out there looking for great movies and have less time to watch Marvel movies. I'll probably watch Avengers 4 and that better have a good ending. Maybe I'll skip the one after that. We'll see."
578,6,"Enjoyable...on the basis of low expectations To chime with a majority of other reviews I would say this film is enjoyable, on the basis that your expectations are fairly low. There is a decent bit of clunky acting (some of it is just awkward rather than clunky) and I didn't find myself jumping up and down with excitement during the action sequences. Also, not to sound too negative, the characters aren't easy to love and I didn't find myself rooting for Antman in the same way as I have with Thor and others from the marvel universe.There were however some positives, the big redeeming factor for me was the dialogue between characters (Michael Pena in paticuler is good value) and while there's is only a minor link to infinity war, it did add an exciting end note on which to leave the film."
579,8,"Best sequel since Godfather 2 Ant-man and the Wasp was fun and still carried the high standard of the MCU. It was better than the first movie because it wasn't an origin story and the characters already had backgrounds. Ant-man and the Wasp gave further backstory to Hank and his wife Janet, exploring into the quantum realm and giving us some plainly bad ass scenes of the Wasp. Solid movie, it's a must see for those who enjoy fun and creative movies."
580,5,"So dissapointed... What a lame movie.. what happened? It was so dull, the jokes and story fell flat also. Movie feels like it was made in a rush also. Please go back to the draw boarding."
581,7,"A pocket sized adventure. After the cataclysmic havoc and devastating aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War, Marvels decision to follow up with a smaller scale (literally), light hearted comedy-adventure film was a smart choice. We return to the life of Scott Lang (Rudd), who is serving time under house arrest following his violation of the Sokovia Accords (as seen in Captain America: Civil War). Interrupting his quiet life (mere days before his two year sentence is up) is a message (of sorts) from Janet Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), who remains trapped in the sub-atomic quantum realm. Reaching out to Hank and Hope Pym (Douglas & Lilly), who have since severed all ties with him in light of his recklessness, Scott swiftly finds himself thrown straight back into his old superhero antics as they band together once again to rescue Janet (who was long presumed dead) from the quantum realm.Peyton Reed returns to direct, although sadly this time there is no involvement at all from Edgar Wright. Of all the superheroes introduced so far in the sprawling MCU, Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man feels the most human of them all. Awkward, fanboyish (evidential in his first meeting with Steve Rodgers/Captain America), and ultimately the down on his luck everyman, Scott feels wholly relatable and is a protagonist who is easy to root for. Hope Pym (in a larger role this time around) suits up as the Wasp alongside Scott, determined to rescue her long lost mother, despite there only being the faintest chance of returning her home safe. It is this arc that provides the movie with its emotional backbone, and it was exciting to see the Wasp debut officially after being teased towards the end of the original film. Both Rudd and Lilly share great chemistry together on screen, resulting in one of the most likable superhero duos to grace the big screen.What I found most enjoyable about the film was its cheerful energy. It's definitely one of the funniest Marvel movies yet, and it takes joy in the fact that it isn't taking itself all too seriously. It's funny; very funny, in fact, and is thoroughly engaging thanks to its breezy pacing and bonkers action sequences. If there's something lacking in the film, it's a truly compelling villain. Just recently the MCU gave us Thanos and Killmonger; two menacing, fleshed out antagonists with well thought out story arcs, but Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost feels merely serviceable at best. Though it won't be the most memorable of the MCU batch, Ant-Man & the Wasp is still an entertaining film to tie us over until next years Captain Marvel and the as of yet untitled fourth Avengers film. With continuously funny gags and a charming cast at its core, this pocket sized adventure may just be what Marvel fans need should they still be reeling from that surprising Infinity War finale."
582,8,An improvement from the first one ! I had watched the first Ant-Man back in 2015. And I was very much excited about that movie but unfortunately it didn't met my expectations. So I left the hope that the second installment will follow the same route as the first one.But it rather became a surprise for me. It was better !! Right from the acting point of view to the action scenes and the climax the film each and every element induced me to be glued to my seat and enjoy this fun adventure.I will surely recommend this movie to others.
583,8,"It's dedicated to being the best version of itself it can possibly be: a fantastically fun time. 'Ant-Man And The Wasp (2018)' feels like a feature that knows exactly what it wants to be - a smaller, more personal superhero film with a lighter tone and an appropriate focus on fast-paced fun. It seems to know exactly how to be it, too, perhaps even more so than the first. Almost every aspect of its production confidently comes together to form an experience totally committed to being the best version of itself it can possibly be. It's a perfect counter-point to the much heavier, though more affecting, 'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' - which was released the same year. The picture is an incredibly fun time that doesn't hang about for a second. It thankfully keeps a keen focus on its characters - who are, admittedly, slightly less rounded than before - and brings some occasionally genuinely funny but always refreshingly charming and character-driven comedy to the forefront. The narrative tries some interesting things within its limited scope and only makes a couple of minor - and ultimately excusable - missteps along the way. All of this makes it perhaps even better - certainly in terms of enjoyment - than its predecessor, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of the 'MCU' at large. 8/10"
584,8,"You're the world's greatest grandma... **minor spoilers** ""Ant-man and The Wasp""Genre: Fantasy/Comic Book Or ""Why wasn't Ant-man in Infinity War?"" When I walked in the theater, I was expecting this to be fun but I had one bearing question in my mind, ""Why wasn't Ant-man in Infinity War?"" I will tell you I did have fun...and although patience was a virtue I was able to get the question answered. Whether you're big or small...or short or tall...this is for sure a break from the intensity that we have received lately in the MCU. So let's press the red button an break this movie down into teeny tiny pieces with The Lowedown... Cast=10 The original cast comes back for ""Ant-man and The Wasp""...Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michael Pena, and the rest of the scooby gang. Plus you get some added love from Laurence Fishburne and Michelle Pfeiffer...I have to award maximum points for this. It's a great way to start it off...ten points. Acting=6 Not a whole lot of substance here. Evangeline Lilly is the high point in the acting, but unfortunately one is not enough to give a high score. The acting was pretty standard for the rest of the cast...nothing to write home about. It's MCU after all, so you can't expect Oscars...that leaves it up to the script to give the players something to work with. It just felt like there wasn't a whole lot there...you can't make beef stew without meat and potatoes after all. Six points get added to the total. Plot=7 As Scott is on house arrest after Civil War, he is trying to put Ant-man aside and just be a father. A vision of the sub-atomic universe leads him back to Henry and Hope for help...only to find they have to confront ghosts from their past. Solid plot..an interesting concept that made for some interesting scenes. I will award seven points here. Ending=6 I did not love the ending...but it was the mid-credit scene that made the movie for me. If you want to know what happened to Ant-man in Infinity War, you will get your answer. It just kind of overshadowed the end of the movie for me, so I can't give full points. Let's call it six points Story=7 There were some holes in the story, but it's MDU. Ant-Man's story stands on its own and has no real link to any other MCU films. It has a beginning, middle, and end...I didn't understand the timeline of it until the mid credits scene. Does it get full points? well no...I felt it needed to play better. So I'll throw a seven at it. Favorite Quote, ""You put a dime in him, you got to let the whole song play out.""Genre: Fantasy Imagine=9 Whether it was enlarging a Pez dispenser or shrinking a building to a carry-on, ""Ant-man and The Wasp"" brings it in the creativity department. Unfortunately, it did not one-up what we've already seen...so I could not give it full points. But nine points is well deserved...please don't throw a salt shaker at me. CGI=10 I mean geez...the CGI was amazing here. I have come to expect it from MCU and this movie delivered in spades. The constant shift in size made the fight scenes so fun to watch. For the visuals alone, this movie is worth a watch...ten points for Ravenclaw!! Pace=6 When I watch a movie like this, I want more of a blistered pace. ""Ant-man and The Wasp"" kind of sputtered a bit all the way through...with a couple points where the movie dragged more than I expected. It was still good, but I can't give full points for the pace of the film...so six points will be thrown underhanded to the score.Sub-genre: Comic Book Comic=7 I can't say I'm familiar with the comic and maybe I'm more accustomed to Hank Pym being Ant-man and Wasp being in The Avengers already. That means I cannot give full points...if it is a reboot of the storyline in the comic, then why reboot this and not say Iron Man? I will give them the benefit of the doubt and award seven points here. Funny=9 ""You can do it...you can do anything...you're the world's greatest grandma."" Funny? It's Paul Rudd and he can't help but try to be funny. Michael Pena was good, but he wasn't as involved on a funny level as the first. In comic book movies, you have to have some levity. The laws of physics are out the window in this world where the very universe is hanging in the balance...please make me laugh. They made me laugh enough to award nine points...thanks! My Score: 7.7 It's movies like this that makes me enjoy life. I never believed that in my lifetime I would be able to watch a live action movie from a comic book the way it needed to be done. It seems that technology has caught up with our imagination and I couldn't be happier (unless of course I could be in one of these films...LOL). But alas, I am happy just siting in the theater, munching on popcorn, drinking a coke zero, and enjoying what I have only pictured on a splash page to be right there in front of me...on an even bigger splash page!"
585,8,"Ant-Man and Infinity War I just wanted to say that Michael Pena was great, he just never skips a beat and his timing is razor, add to this is that he is funny. Just a quibble, was upset that Ant-man was not in Avengers infinity war, so hope to see him in part 2. The Avengers are going to need all the help they can get and it will be nice to see Ant-man working with Tony (because they both have specialized suits) and the others, I hope the Wasp will be there as well. A quick mention about the Wasp claiming she was coerced into taking off part of her clothes, if she didnt want to take anything off she didnt have to I think she's playing this for her own purposes. Its just like Wonder Woman critics saying why did the amazons appear in bikini's, Uhh well why does Hurcules appear bare chested with a Loin cloth in all his movies, because that is what they wore during that period! Finally I wanted to refer to Avengers Infinity and say that the 3D finally showed atleast two or three scenes where the action flies in your face and you feel you can touch it, thank you. If you ever been to Universal studios Florida, many rides have these True 3D effects that aren't just depth perception but actually come out at you and that's a whole lot of fun, continue this in Infinity War 2 at the appropriate intervals naturally and tastefully it's what we expect in Imax 3D. Hopefully those tickets will go down, by the way the 4D experience for Jurassic World was just awesome, keep it coming but keep those prices down to allow more to go see it, its a treat for anyone who hasnt seen it. Going back to Infinity War this was so well done, the script, acting, action, and special effects all A+ all the way everyone was at the top of their game, awesome! A few suggestion, althought Thanos's face looked very well done in CGI, his body did not, it looked fake can you guys improve that, also the whole Hulk not wanting to come out?! Please give us Hulk in part 2 and not that stupid Hulk in Thor: Ragnarok who was acting like a child, please no! Let Mark Ruffalo be the intellect he's done a great job all around and please have the CGI on the Hulk be the equal if not better than he looked in Avengers Part 1 and 2. In Infinity War he looked fake, there was a decline in the CGI graphics and you guys have wracked up quite enough profits to be able to make sure that all the heroes get the proper attention, so please comply. That said can't wait to see Infinity War 2 (we all can't wait to see what happens, keep the script tight!) and Ant-man 3. You guys really have to pull all the stops on 3, with a bigger budget and a really tight script to really make it memorable, suggestion have Spiderman in the film, seeing him along side Ant-Man & the Wasp is really special because of their connection."
586,7,"Solid Marvel Movie Huge fan of all things superheroes: I did enjoy this movie. Despite it seeming campy and a lot of jokes, this movie did exactly what it meant to do: entertain. It was a solid Marvel movie, and set up Avengers 4 nicely!"
587,6,"Shallow fun but ultimately a bit of a disappointment I really enjoyed the first Ant-Man movie, it was fun and quirky and disjointed from the rest of MCU.In addition to this, I generally have loved all the other MCU movies, even Iron Man 3.A lot of this went over my head, too much techno babble which I stopped paying attention to and I don't know, but I must have missed something because the ""villain"" of the movie was just some randomer with some random weird fading thing going on. I didn't get it, worse than that - I didn't care either. It has Laurence Fishburn in it too, why? Dunno, don't care.I did like the relationship between father and daughter, I liked the idea of making normally small things big. I liked some of the fight scenes and chases... I also liked Michael Pena.After Black Panther and Infinity War recently I was hoping for big things but this is more filler than thriller. I'm glad I went to see it, but I wouldn't worry about not seeing it again."
588,8,Good and funny Was eagerly waiting for this after Avengers Infinity war and certainly I didn't disappoint me. It had a good script written along with added humor making the film more comfortable to watch. Certainly one of the best of MCU.
589,10,"Another Summer Slam from MCU Antman & The Wasp. A popcorn movie that delivers in truckloads! Watching people and ""stuff"" shrinking to micro-sized then popping to full size or even giant-sized then back to micro-sized was its own movie metaphor. From Antman's playtime with his daughter to his trials with the FBI to his technically-challenged prototype suit to his crew's bumbling ""backup,"" the laughs just keep rolling. And just about the time you think you'll get a gulp of O2, Stan Lee delivers his best-yet cameo. When ""Ant's"" crew get's kidnapped, it touches off a truth serum debate reminiscent of ""Who's on first?"" The pace is so perky the Douglas-Pfeiffer waltz-thru doesn't matter. Oh yeah. You might need to shield the children's eyes during the seagull-ant-slaughter scene.As always, you have to hang around for the post-credit preview.Another solid A (ok, A- for you sticklers) from the MCU."
590,8,"As expected Well well well, nothing new here folks! Very good film, targeted the audience well, entertaining, funny, cute, sad, all of the emotions. But predictable. As expected. Nothing shocking or new, nothing they haven't touched on before, a bit repetitive and sadly slightly underwhelming. But overall enjoyable, and fun to watch. Just very simple and predictable."
591,7,Fab fab not drab Not the weakest plot but a good sequel and lead into avengers sub plots
592,8,"Really enjoyable Definitely an improvement on the first but always find that with sequels, the origin story has been covered so just cracks on from there. Definitely worth a watch"
593,10,"Another great title from MCU. In fact, I went for marathon Ant-Man + Ant-Man and the Wasp so comparing to Ant-Man, which was quite boring for me at the beginning (before Scott got the Ant-Man suit), Ant-Man and the Wasp was way better! Plot takes place after events of Captain America: Civil War, and Scott is under house arrest for 2 years because of his illegal actions. So whenever he sneaks out home, I was feeling anxious: would he be caught and be AGAIN in trouble because of it? The villain wasn't ""really"" bad, but her motives were real, you could relate to her and her actions. Also, the other ""villain"" (the business man) was rather annoying than bad? But still I was lauging when I was supposed to laugh and be nervous when I was supposed to. It's good to watch superheroes not saving the world or universe, or not even being local superheroes but do something good for someone they know well."
594,8,"Ignore the <5 star ratings Reading through other 'reviewers'' ratings on here just shows why they are casual, amateur users rather than actual critics. This certainly wasn't a one or two star film - those ratings should be reserved for truly awful productions. I wouldn't even give Suicide Squad such a low rating. On the other hand, it's hard to see that this film deserves a 10.This is a fun film much like the first. Yes it borrows a couple of humourous moments and themes from the original Ant-Man, but there is enough originality within this as well as a foundation for future MCU films to see this as a pretty significant installment in franchise.The film is professionally and competently pulled together (therefore exempting it immediately from a sub three star rating). Performances by all of the cast range from average (rapping's your forte, TI) to strong. Evangeline Lilly steps up and deserves being a titular character. There are good performances again from Rudd, Douglas and Peña and welcome additions with John-Kamen, Fishbourne and Pfeiffer. Slight spoiler here that there is a happy ending for everyone (except for some of our six legged friends :'-().In truth, the 7.5 average rating seems right. I gave it an 8 purely because of the reasons above and rounding."
595,3,"Totally disappointing I couldn't see how they could scew this up after such a great first movie, but they did. Jokes weren't funny, ridiculous premise, and no character worth caring about. One of Marvel's worst films to date. I hope this isn't a sign to come, although with how many flicks they are pumping out it's bound to happen."
596,6,"Science mistakes and comedy Why writers team ignored that shrinking things weigh more than normal things aka density increases while it shrinks, normal man cant lift up or pull it. When building shrinks into luggage size then its density might have too much that we cant move it like trolly."
597,7,"Ant-Man returns Having enjoyed a vast majority of Marvel's superhero output (more so than most) without worshipping them, 'Ant-Man' was a minor effort from them but there was still a good amount to like about it. Despite being positively received by critics, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' as of now has received also heavy criticism from fans and some Marvel non-fans, so was conflicted in seeing it.'Ant-Man' and its slightly superior follow-up 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' managed to be better than expected. 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to me was not as great as critics are saying, but it is also nowhere near as bad as people here have said, while sharing a few of their criticisms. Do like the character of Ant-Man. He is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that have had longer longevity and perhaps have more compelling origins and stories, hence why they are adapted more. Also wasn't sure what to make of the trailer, which made the film out to be rather bland in story and too reliant on humour while being very well made, directed and acted with thrilling action and funny and clever moments.Seeing it for myself, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' could have been better and has its faults, ones that are somewhat the same as the first 'Ant-Man' and somewhat what was expected from watching the trailer. The script is mostly fine, but has patchy moments, namely the overly-wordy and sometimes over-complicated jargon and inconsistent humour. While the humour mostly works wonders, there are a few instances where it's not so funny and not very well placed.Such as in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and heart-warming (more so generally than 'Ant-Man')and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene, though more sporadically thankfully than before. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching, the chemistry is more believable here, while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches in a film that generally is appropriately lighter in tone and faster paced.Like many people here, also found the villains underwhelming. Burch is especially pointless and forgettable and only really there because there seemingly needed to be an obligatory villain when actually there could have been just one. 'Thor Ragnarok' and 'Infinity War' only had one major one, and they, especially Thanos were the best villains in the Marvel canon. Ghost fares a little better and is an improvement over Corey Stoll's under-characterised villain in the first 'Ant-Man', her problem was that her back-story was very rushed and didn't feel developed enough. Michelle Pfeiffer is wasted in a very underwritten plot-device role.On the other hand, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is a great looking film, it's beautifully shot, very atmospheric, is very slick and the special effects, are clever and of the usual high-quality Marvel standards. The music avoids being over-bearing, one-note, too quirky or too bombastic, fitting well tone, mood and pace-wise.Direction is more than competent, keeping the story going at a solid pace and the telling of it interesting enough, though maybe a little more flavour may have been more welcome. While the action is not as much as most Marvel films, it is fun, thrilling, nicely choreographed and tautly shot and edited, especially towards the end. The stuff with sizes was clever visually and interested and entertained while the film is better than a lot of sequels in being consistent in the continuity.There is some very smart and hugely entertaining scripting and dialogue here in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' too. While it doesn't work completely seamlessly, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp's humour when it works is some of the funniest stuff of all Marvel films, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously or too much of a joke either, instead not being afraid to embrace the silliness and humour while ensuring still that the subject matter is treated with respect. The truth serum and the feminine side being brought out parts were hilarious.The story is mostly diverting, it's and the first 'Ant-Man' film are narratively simpler than most Marvel outings and less risks here are taken than most Marvel films but it always makes sense, moments of dullness and jarring are few (while not being completely absent either), it's fun and it doesn't try to do too much or try to insert too many characters.While not complex as such, the characters are mostly engaging, with the reservations being with the villain and Pfeiffer's character. Paul Rudd is a strong and hugely entertaining lead, while Michael Peña's hilarious in a role that could have been really annoying. The seasoned support of a distinguished Michael Douglas adds hugely too, and Evangeline Lilly and Abby Ryder Fortson give the film some much needed heart. Hannah John-Kamon does command the screen and Walton Goggins has an oily presence that is more than what the forgettable and useless character deserved.Overall, not one of Marvel's best and has its flaws but a good sequel and film with many great things. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
598,7,"Pretty Good film Obviously this movie is no Ragnarok or Infinity War if you going into such a movie expecting so then you are lost. Sure this movie is more of a filler and a set up of what's to come but hey this movie was enjoyable.There were not any primary villains in this movie, therefore it was nice to see a new approach to a superhero film.The special effect and CGI were near perfect.I have no complaints about this movie because of what it is.I give it a 7 because it was just a filler movie."
599,8,"This is what we needed..! The only disappointed fans from this movie who were expected a revenge or any kind of reaction after the infinite war, but in the fact this was what we needed A nice story full of fun and jokes for everyone. It was not great, but it was what we needed."
600,5,"It's ok at best No as funny or entertaining as the first ant man. But my biggest gripe is the time line of it, in the post credit scene we experience Thanos's snap and see Hank his wife and hope vanish. The snap is at the very end of infinity wars so this suggests that the events of ant man and wasp were happening at the same time Thanos had came to earth, iron man had had gone to space on a Thanos ship and the world was in panic mode. Yet the cops and feds in this film seem more bothered that Scott Lang stays in his house? Why ain't they concerned with Thanos ?"
601,5,Not to good Had good story but not enough action in first 3/4 of the movie
602,7,"Fun and well done like most Marvel movies I have read some reviews panning the villain in this movie. That was my favorite part and character as she wasn't really a villain. Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost was compelling and passionate. It was basically her or Michelle Pfeifers character that could live so she was fighting for her life. She was obsessed and driven to the point of insanity. My only complaint was the evil business man character which I didn't think was needed or maybe could have a had a different part. That character just seemed stereotypical and put in to just have a real bad guy. Otherwise it was fun and a nice continuation of the first Ant-man. If you like the Marvel movies, see this and enjoy."
603,7,"Good Marvel Film This movie was really good (just good for Marvel standard). I find myself thinking I liked the first Ant-man better, at the end of this movie. Like first Ant-Man there were a lot of humor in this movie, they're still unique from other super heroes but the story line is a little lacking and there was no super villain person or organization that would take this movie to another level."
604,8,"Ignore the Vicious Reviews Look folks. I get it. There are a LOT of blockbuster movies nowadays that seem to mysteriously draw wonderful, stellar reviews but are actually really lousy movies. War for Planet of the Apes. Blade Runner 2049. The Wolf of Wall Street. But rest assured, this is not one of them.Is Ant-Man and the Wasp a stunning, ground-breaking foray into unprecedented creativity? No. If anything, it's a demonstration of what we already know: There are so many damn superhero movies in the cinema these days that doing anything genuinely innovative is getting harder and harder. But is Ant-Man worth the price of admission?Hell, yes. If Marvel made a movie about superheroes reading the phone book, it would probably be worth ten bucks and two hours of your life. Paul Rudd was terrific, the pacing was good, the special effects were fun, there were a lot of laughs (and I dare say I enjoyed it much more than the appallingly over-rated Black Panther).Ant-Man and the Wasp. It ain't making cinematic history, it ain't one of MCU's best ever, but it's a very fun ride and well worth seeing."
605,8,"A Successful Palate Cleanser Ant-Man and the Wasp takes place a few days before the events of Infinity War, so the world is still in its usual status-quo. Scott is out of contact with Hank and Hope after his Civil War expedition put them at odds, and he's under house arrest as a result. Meanwhile Hank and Hope have been constructing a Quantum Tunnel in order to travel to the Quantum Realm and retrieve Hank's wife (Hope's mother) Janet, who was lost there thirty years prior. Unfortunately someone tangentially linked to Hank and his work with SHIELD is seeking their work in order to fix their misplaced molecular structure, that leaves them in chronic pain and constantly shifting in and out of existence.Ultimately Ant-Man and the Wasp is a story of family. Its main driving force (which is refreshing for a superhero movie) is the rescue of a long-lost family member, rather than a beat-em-up with the film's antagonist. In fact, Ghost is less of a villain and more one of many speed bumps Scott, Hank, and Hope have to tackle to achieve their goal. Ghost isn't even the only antagonist in the movie set up to interfere with our heroes. Sonny Burch is a shady black market trader who wants to sell off components to the Quantum Tunnel, and Agent Woo is Scott's FBI equivalence of a parole officer who's attempting to keep the whole situation within the law, including keeping Scott at home to serve out the last few hours of his house arrest. None of them are particularly evil (morally questionable at best), and none of them seek any kind of usual antagonist motive such as world-domination or vengeance. Ghost just wants to save herself from being phased out of existence.Anyway, back to this being a movie about family. The familial bond between Hank and Hope, and Scott and Cassie, are what drives the emotional core of the movie. Even Ghost finds family in an old associate of Hank's; Dr. Bill Foster, who has been helping her manage her condition. Even Scott's ex-wife and her new husband are painted as positive influences in the Lang family dynamics, breaking the cliché of ex-wives and step-fathers being contrary and antagonistic. Instead each are very supportive of Scott and look out for him as best as they can.Of course being the second Ant-Man movie, it's brimming with humour was well, and in a way I feel Ant-Man and the Wasp hits the comedy highs better than the original Ant-Man did. Of course Luis and his eclectic storytelling his back, allowing Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly a chance to take on the over-emphasised miming (and each seeming to have a lot of fun with it). There's a number of running jokes (World's Greatest Grandma), a couple of meta jokes (""We look like ourselves at a baseball game""), a couple of awkward jokes (""...Do you want to go to dinner?""), a number of physical jokes (thanks in most part to traditionally small things becoming suddenly large and traditionally large things becoming suddenly small, as would be expected for an Ant-Man movie), and of course character-based jokes too (like watching Paul Rudd play Janet).The action is pretty good as well, again thanks to the aforementioned use of small things becoming big and big things becoming small. Watching Wasp dart around a kitchen making herself big and small at the ire of the henchmen she's taking out is definitely a movie-highlight, as is the climatic car chase involving Hot Wheels cars suddenly becoming big, flipping over and dodging other vehicles.There's some really good effects work here too. The size differences between people and things is done really well, like seeing Scott suddenly enlarged in a janitor's closet, and Janet having to lean over him to fix his regulator, as well as seeing Scott stuck toddler-sized attempting to clamber into the van and appearing noticeably smaller than everyone else. Honestly I'm not even sure if this was perspective trickery or straight-up CGI. Ghost is also done really well thanks to effects work, forever engulfed in a cloud of her immediate past and immediate future actions, that shows she's not really planted in this realm of existence. Then there's the deeper and more developed look at the Quantum Realm and going sub-atomic, including a fantastic short scene involving tardigrades blown to huge proportions (relatively), and sequences packed full of colour and shapes reminding me of that fantastic sequence in Doctor Strange. But for me, what impressed me once again was Marvel's de-aging formula, which still throws every other attempt out of the water. Seeing young Michael Douglas, young Michelle Pfeiffer, and young Laurence Fishburne was like plucking them straight out of their work in the 80s and 90s. Flawless.Ant-Man and the Wasp probably isn't a movie to expect big things from. It's a true palate cleanser. It strips all the bombast of previous MCU movies down into something a lot more intimate and personal. There's no grand set-pieces, there's no plot to take over the world, it's just a rescue mission involving a miniaturised building exchanging hands. It's more about the lighthearted humour and character interactions to help us forget about the miserable ending of Infinity War. It doesn't advance the wider MCU plot much at all. It's just a nice little bit of light entertainment wisely placed between the earth-changing events of Infinity War and Avengers 4. I give it a solid 8/10, as I was entertained throughout, and really don't have many criticisms at all. It was never meant to be anything more than it is, and it served its purpose in the grand scheme very well. It was definitely better than the first Ant-Man."
606,5,"Buzzkill We all love investing in Marvel - and they know we do. Instead of simply explaining how Antman and the Wasp enter IW2 in a 5-10 backstory, they spun this yarn for 90 mins which really isn't necessary.It was entertaining with frequent comedy but it fails to stitch anything together. To my earlier point Marvel know this and decide to create yet another B movie.However if you like consenting to your bank balance being mugged then you might just enjoy this. Paul Rudd fans will enjoy this. MSU fans will feel indifferent.The mid credits scene was worth the experience. It leaves you guessing just like IW2. That's 4 stars on its own for me.If you want to laugh, give it go. If you want to see a superhero movie. Wait for Venom!"
607,8,I enjoyed it No it wasn't as good as the first one but I thought the movie was pretty good. I was entertained for a couple hours on a Monday afternoon. Post credit scene is a must see.
608,7,"A film of two halves. The first half of Ant-Man and The Wasp is weak: the freshness of the original isn't there, the action is lacking and many of the gags fall flat. Fortunately, the film improves vastly in a second half that boasts some truly astounding action set-pieces and much better jokes, and which leaves the viewer wanting more with an end-credits sequence that caught me off-guard (I blame tiredness - it was hot last night and I didn't sleep at all well).The plot is no great shakes - it's one long fight between the goodies and the baddies for the possession of a quantum tunnel, with some schmaltzy stuff between Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and his daughter thrown in for good measure, and requires some serious suspension of disbelief - but the pace is fast and the direction slick, with lots of jaw dropping CGI (the shrinking/expanding effects are incredible). And whoever cast Michelle Pfeiffer as Evangeline Lilly's mother is a genius: the resemblance between the two is uncanny.Not the best that Marvel has to offer, but not the worst either, this is serviceable summer entertainment that fills the void between Avengers movies.5/10 for the first half, 8/10 for the second half, giving an average of 6.5, which I'll round up to 7 for the giant ant in the bath."
609,5,"Fun with humor that's works surprisingly well So on a humor basis this movie is pretty good, most of the humor was pretty hit or miss but luckily enough it hit the mark for me (I suggest you see this with friends it really helps) As for the plot I can't say the same. The plot is by no means bad. It just isn't super spectacular or anything. which is okay. As for the villains, I really liked them their motivations were really agreeable. The acting was pretty good nothing spectacular. Overall a pretty avarage and inoffensive movie. I wouldn't say there is much to motivate you to see it besides the after credits scene but you probably won't think your time was wasted if you do go to see it. Overall it was a good time.Hope you enjoyed my review and have a great day"
610,4,"Movie could be 15 min long Probably the worst Marvel movie when it comes to Plot , Character Development and Story. There were some funny bits and nice effects , the post credit scene and that's it . If I was gonna edit the good parts all together then the movie would be 10 o 15 min long ."
611,10,Great jokes I couldn't stop laughing! But great movie for everyone to enjoy!
612,10,Really good one! It was one of the best but I hope they put and end to the series and don't over do it but the plot was weird!
613,7,"Not as bad as others would have you believe This is an entertaining addition to the MCU, funny, and with enough action to keep my attention throughout.Plot-wise it's not the strongest film ever, and yes you'll be asking yourself ""how did someone survive for 30 years with no food and water, and in an environment where the protective suit was meant to be warn at all times"" as well as ""how do they connect electricity and water to their constantly moving home/lab""?If you are able to grasp that this is science fiction, and are not too expectant of anything then, like me, you'll be entertained and will laugh along throughout the film."
614,6,"Very genric Story writting Right im not gonna give this review like a fanboy and give it a 10 out 10 review of the film, Not gonna happen. No im, not a DC fanboy, I'm a film critic that reviews a film as a whole and gives my honest opinion whether its a DC or Marvel.Not gonna say the film is complete bad it does have its good points but it has a lot of bad points as well, Evangeline Lilly gave a more active role in this sequel was a good choice to make, she did pretty well with her performance and actually kicked ass, I do feel at some points she was carrying the film.Visually the special effects are pretty well done there are some major problems with the story that makes you have to switch off your brain. Some of the jokes were funny but half the film missed the mark in areas.With a great performance from Lawrence Fishburne with what he was scripted, Father-daughter dynamic between Scott and his daughter was likeable throughout the film show a father love for his kids give a film cute family moments.This is all I can stay that is good about this film.Dislikes: The biggest problem with this film is too many writers, as the story is completely all over the place, a lot of the jokes in typical generic marvel films fall flat like they were meant to be funny moments. They weren't funny, not even the audience I was sat with was laughing, there funny and there funny that complete incoherent and void of humour, this is the typical Marvel comedy that seems to be a trend.This is why for me personal out of 20 films now Marvel has done, only 4 of Marvel films have had a grounded story and better writer, Captain America: First Avenger, Avengers, Captain America 2 winter solider, Avengers infinity war. Sadly I found the others very generic, sadly I find Ant-man and the wasp the very same generic film as the rest.What I mean by generic is the villains, A well-written villian is someone with purpose and motive to be evil and not someone that just evil because they are evil, This is the problem with the character Ghost. Although they did give a brief background story of her being weaponized, the story is very weak written which make her a weak villian.Which make this film Generic and very medicroe, not as bad as the first film was, but almost equal to it.The other thing as well is part of this film blatantly tell you to switch your brain off, I mean the building being shrunk to a small size which is in the trailer, but it the fact it gets put back to it original size serval times, it automatically go power and connect to the plumbing, like really?Having the ability to shrink to small size ya is believable, but having a building shrunk and then put back to it original sizes with everything inside intact sorry is a little far-fetched when it would be like an earthquake. This is what I mean the film kind of ask you to switch your brain off.So overall I found this film very generic in its writing for the story, and very medicroe altogether."
615,8,"You actually get what you want! Great Fun, Action and another Nice Marvel Movie ! Ant-man 2 has some hilarious and visually stunning Moments! The cast is as good as in the First ant man installment, especially Abbie Ryder Fortson in the role of Cassie! The Action and visuals are cool and chilling. All in all this marvel Movie is worth to watch if you know the other MCU movies."
616,5,"Ant-Man and the Wasp shrinks so far down that it in itself becomes pointless. What I can only describe as the biggest disappointment of the year thus far, this entry into Marvel's epic cinematic universe is possibly their weakest yet. In this chapter, Ant-Man must team up with Wasp in order to retrieve her missing mother from the quantum realm. Right, where to start? Before I detail my thoughts, I would like to highlight that I do enjoy the offerings from Marvel Studios. What this sequel has going for itself is continuity. It very much feels like an additional chapter, referencing previous scenarios from its predecessors. The characters retain their scintillating personalities, particularly Scott, Hope and Luis, maintaining the consistency of the original. Imaginative use of visual effects to illustrate the quantum realm and manipulate size transformations during the infrequent action sequences. The inherent issue that shrouds this entry, is the fact that it is defined as a ""filler"" in a densely developed arc story. That would be justifiable, if I could say this film was fun. It's not. It grows increasingly boring with each minute. Nothing happens! Any situation that does occur, whether it be characters reuniting or family bonding, contained no substance. The whole plot and it's characters were painted with such a thin layer of gloss, that it actually it amounted to nothing. The use of both visual and literary comedy missed at every opportunity, conveyed so forcefully as if Rudd was shoving his effortlessly charismatic personality down your throat. Honestly, some of the ""jokes"" were horrendous. The human CGI is quite painful to watch and takes you out of the innovative set pieces that director Reed attempts to convey. Ghost, who's molecular instability looks fantastic, is underdeveloped. Burch was pointless and his sole purpose is to provide henchmen for an action sequence. The acting was serviceable at best and the plot is filled with illogical conveniences. It's rare that I say this, particularly for a Marvel film, but I'm in the minority. As far as I'm concerned, this film can go subatomic."
617,7,"Good family entertainment Not as great as most of the MCU movies, but it's fun, action packed and entertaining. Not one you will remember in years to come but enjoyable while it lasts. Still funnier and better than most action movies you will see this summer. I think a lot of the negative reviews are down to superhero overkill. Go see it."
618,8,"Stock standard Marvel fare If you're a Marvel fan, this is more of the same, light hearted superhero action with the introduction of a more than capable Wasp taking her place on screen.Funny how so many men cry foul over a strong female character, but in the end, if you feel threatened by such, this is not the movie for you.On the other hand, if you are looking for a strong role model for your kids, the Wasp is definitely a plus. Kicking butt and taking charge.Two thumbs up and a sidekick from my friends 7 year-old who was very satisfied with discovering the Wasp. And I thoroughly enjoyed it too."
619,4,"The worst Marvel Movie in a long time Ant Man and the Wasp had a lot of potential but in the end it failed to live up to its hype. This movie falls completely flat when compared to the fantastic Black Panther or the great Infinity War.The plot was boring and nothing really exciting happened. The cast of characters were very weak for a marvel movie. This movie was also lacking in action. There was way too many unfunny and annoying jokes, at time I felt like I was watching some kind of Disney movie.It's just a disappointing movie overall. This favors boring and unfunny jokes over good action and characters."
620,7,"Kept me laughing Whilst the film can't be compared to the likes of Winter Soldier, Civil War or Black Panther in terms of story telling and drama (it's pretty generic), where it shines is in the humour. This movie is a VAST improvement on the first, where jokes all too often felt forced and unnecessary.The only real negative I found was that the ever so cool Ghost was tragically wasted and deserved a much greater exposition of character than was afforded to her. Fingers crossed she'll get her own story, or at the very least a team up of sorts further down the line.Overall, whilst the film is unlikely to blow you away, it should at the very least provide you with 2 hours worth of popcorn chomping comedic goodness."
621,9,"Dont listen to the haters.... I loved this movie! I dont understand all the 1 star reviews on here, if your not a fan of this kind of thing then just dont watch them?!? I am a fan. A fan of Marvel, of DC, of comics, of movies.... of pop culture in general. Im not a fan of classical music so I wouldnt go to the opera, if I did, id probably review it as a 1 star show! Thats not to say its a bad show, but I simply wouldnt get it. What Marvel/Disney have achieved is nothing short of epic. 10 years, 20+ movies, billions of pounds at the box office... epic! Ant Man and the Wasp, not epic. Not 'the biggest movie ever made'. Not going to change the course of cinema.... it is however, the most fun ive had in the cinema all year. Its funnier than Deadpool 1, its visually more stunning than Dr Strange, its pluckier than Homecoming and what makes it so special... family. The threat in this film isnt world ending, theres nothing to avenge, guard or defend that is going to affect the big picture and as a result its all the better for it, these heroes and even the 'villain(s)' are only fighting for what they love, there not being asked to protect everyone and everything, they are simply doing what all of us would do to protect our family... but with superpowers! I highly recommend it, if your a fan. If not, Im sure Andre Rieu is playing a show somewhere...."
622,1,"Evangeline Lilly ruined this movie... Although an improvement from the last one, the character still comes up short in the action department. The humor is there and Paul Rudd is fantastic...enjoyable, Then comes Evangeline Lilly who is one of the worst actors in Hollywood...absolutely no talent whatsoever. She ruined LOST with her emotionless and deflated performance. She apparently felt compelled to forego the much needed acting classes and infect this movie instead. Would have been an 8 without her...just horrible."
623,4,"Mediocre. It's entertaining, joyful and mostly funny, however lacking distinction at times.The film was honestly okay. There were some fun moments, however it just didn't really feel enjoyable. It was really rather bland and shallow. It didn't have that unique feel or distinction towards it. It's not something you haven't seen before.Peyton Reed's directing wasn't his best work. The film just wasn't memorable, there were no distinct, engaging scenes.The visuals were good and unique, with the quantum realm and the shrinking perspectives. The action felt decent, nothing truly spectacular or new.Most of the performances were good throughout. Although only a few stood out. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was good, had some decently funny scenes. Evangeline Lily improved from the predecessor as this time she had more to work with being The Wasp.However, the rest of characters just felt really limited. Michael Douglas' Hank Pym had no change in character since the first movie. Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost had some potential to shine in the movie, but Peyton Reed just didn't utitlise her potential. The rest of the cast were just sort of there, like they were just in the film. Didn't have more of a purpose, other than being comic relief.Now Walton Goggins character, Sonny Burch, was terrible as an antagonist. He was extremely one-dimensional and filled with cliche. He had no relatable motives. He was just there because the film needed a ""bad guy"".The characters in the film barely had any character arcs, at all. Scott Lang started off and ended the same (hopefully), Hope and Hank Pym remained the same, Ghost got what she needed and she just exited the film, the antagonist was defeated and the good guys went home happily ever after...The only memorable piece of soundtrack was the Ant-Man theme, which was from the first film. Nothing else stood out.The humour felt rather dry and forced. Some of it worked, but in the end just seemed bland.Overall, the film is mediocre. There are some aspects keeping it from being bad but nothing really brought it to the ""good"" classification."
624,1,"Leave the PG humor and drama at the door MCU should make PG cartoons of Avengers instead of integrating over the top humor with MCU. The word ""toony"" and ""cartoony"" is describing Star Wars and Marvel movies because of some of the star wars videos from upset fans. Although ""Toony"" ""Cartoony"" ""Anime-ish"" are perfect descriptions for MCU's latest movies. The first Avengers movie was perfect. But the comedy gets worse, pushing jokes beyond Marvel's limits. There's no comic book nostalgia in Ant-Man 2 or the Avengers Infinity war. I don't recognize any stories from the comic books. The characters are comedians now; they feel like brand new characters."
625,8,Enjoyable viewing Ant-Man and the Wasp was an enjoyable and great addition to the Marvel Universe. Many have commented on Ant-Man's place in the universe and the Avengers but it can be said that Ant-man should and does have a place and something to offer.The second film excelled in its humor and probably the marvel film that is the best at doing humor so easily. This is part to Paul Rudd's great take on the character and a strong supporting cast. The plot and funny twists and turns make this a great film to watch. A great performance by Hannah as Ghost who captured the attention when she was on screen. The end credits scenes also offered a great scene and development that ties in the whole Marvel universe and what lies ahead. 8/10
626,2,"Terrible So bad, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a DC film."
627,7,A Fun Summer Movie A nice summer film that's really quite funny. Michael Peña's character steals the show again as in the first Ant-Man. I though the Sonny character was a bit unnessary and just took up time that could have better been devoted to the Ghost story line and developing that a little further. Solid action and story otherwise. The mid-credit scene offered no consolation to the events of Infinity War however which was disappointing but I guess the point.
628,2,"Mediocre movie, nothing worthy of the big screen I'm a huge Marvel fan, and pretty much see all of them in the theaters, I was a bit hesitant with this one just because I thought the original Ant-Man was ""just okay.""In the end the 2nd one wasn't memorable, the story was okay, nothing earth shattering or particularly cool. I'm not saying this because the last Avengers blew everything away, I'm rating on this movie on it's own meritMy biggest complaints was the humor (which we've come to expect from Marvel movies and usually funny), was just off or not funny at all. The only humor that kind of worked for me was Luis and his parts, but even that wasn't enough to carry the movie.This movie also failed from the lack of a decent ""bad guy"" and again I'm not saying this because of the recent Avengers, but the bad guys or gals in this movie just didn't do anything for me. I didn't like them, I didn't dislike them, I didn't care about them. Overall they were little more than a backdrop and if anything felt slapstick funny, but without the funny...Acting & special effects wise it was okay, but again with a story I didn't really care about or characters I didn't really have much investment in, it was hard for the acting to transcend that and help make me care. Special effects were good, which is 100% expected these days but nothing that blew me away visually.I guess if you're a huge fan of Ant-Man or the Wasp, then maybe you'll get more out of this than I did. Other than it tying in certain aspects of the Avengers timeline and giving you a bit more understanding of why Ant-Man wasn't present in the Avengers I got very little out of this movie. Even the after credits scene was stupid and felt more just like filler because they had to do it. Sadly a movie like this makes me put into question whether Marvel really wants to put out good movies or just simply put anything out there to make money"
629,7,"Real heroes. Not actual size. Ant-Man and the Wasp, introduces the Wasp as she teams up with Ant-Man to defeat Marvel's new villain, Ghost, meanwhile also discovering groundbreaking secrets behind the quantum realm. I was truly excited for Ant-Man and the Wasp and couldn't wait to see the Wasp brought to life. The heroes were great with somewhat good action sequences. However, the movie, the plot, and the villains were not all that great. First of all, the movie felt kind of long and got pretty boring on some parts. Also, supposedly the movie is supposed to be laugh out loud funny, though for me it was just a few giggles throughout. Secondly, the plot was everywhere and the movie never focused on just one plot line and instead jumped around. Lastly, every movie needs a great villain and in this movie there were more than one villain and none of them were actual ""villains"" which was very disappointing. The movie was okay though I would not pay money to watch the film in theater. Save you money.Luis: ""Dr. Pym, I actually heard what happened to you. You opened up the quantum realm. That's when this crazy creepy ghost who like walks through walls and stuff stole your tech. now she wants to take over the world, or whatever. Who would have believed that in your hour of need you would turn to us."" Dr. Hank Pym: ""Not me."" Luis: ""No, because we robbed you. Do you remember? That's us."" -Luis and Dr.Hank Pym, Ant-Man and the Wasp"
630,9,"Good It's such a good movie for watching with boxxy software. It's fine with its concepts toward the end. I love to watch movies using boxxy just because the service is for free and it has a good curated content, like this!"
631,9,"Totally Entertaining While most of the genre of Super Hero movies go way over the top trying to emulate their comic book counterparts, ANT-MAN and the WASP departs from the repetition with a storyline you can actually follow, characters you like, and writing that is on-point, funny, and very well done. I suspect this film will appeal to an audience with broader tastes. If you do not require the appearance of Captain America, The Hulk, Ironman, etc., but appreciate a film that includes more than enough action and high-tech gadgetry wrapped around characters with a human side, you will like this entertaining story."
632,10,"AB-SOLUTE-LY GOOD. Evangeline Lilly was a killer wasp, totally badass. Paul Rudd also did an amazing job. The comedic timing, chemistry and comedic timing, was excellent. I absolutely loved it. And also the CGI was not bad at all."
633,10,Hdhdge Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good Very good
634,8,"Another solid entry for the MCU Ant and the Wasp is the 20th entry into the MCU universe. Does it compare to the last three MCU releases (Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Infinity War) NO! However, it provides a great, exciting time in the movie theater. I thought the best part of the movie was Wasp played by Evangeline Lilly. And Paul Rudd's relationship with his daughter Cassie. I loved how they extended all the possibilities of Pym's technology in the movie. The comedy worked for me for the most part. My flaw with this movie is that it gets a little conventional. Certain people are placed in the movie for no particular reason. Despite this, Ant and the Wasp is good fun if you are a fan of the MCU."
635,8,"A Superhero Comedy Hilariously entertaining and a fun, light-hearted plot. Very different than the events that happened in Infinity War. Who knew making things big and small would be so entertaining?"
636,6,"Mediocre at best This movie just didn't do it for me. It had lazy storytelling, flat characters and the best shots were in the trailer of the movie. There also wasn't a lot of logic behind some of the "" magical "" things happening. I expect more from Marvel and for me this their weakest movie yet."
637,6,"Simple, funny and relaxing I know it is kind of late but I just saw Ant-Man and the Wasp yesterday and thought I should leave a review for it. This was a more easy-going and funnier experience compared to the other two juggernauts Marvel brought to us this year. And while it is not as great as the other two, it was an enjoyable experience.The film takes place after the events of Civil War and right before Infinity War. During this time, Scott Lang is under house arrest to be near his daughter Cassie. However, trouble arises when a mysterious character named Ghost shows up, and Scott will have to adopt the alter ego Ant-Man again with the help from the Wasp(Hope van Dyne) and Hank Pym to stop Ghost and fix their problems from the past.The film's plot was rather simple, mostly because the story focuses on the characters and they delivered a plot which is easy to follow, but not too predictable. However, its simplicity also means some parts of the story will feel illogical. Any parts that didn't add up, they will either throw an exposition or the phrase 'Quantum' in there to explain. That's lazy writing.The film haonls many characters and sadly, many of them felt out of place or under-developed. The main reason for this is the introduction of the Wasp. And while she was an amazing she character, she outshone the rest of the cast, including our main protagonist Scott/Ant-Man. Hannah John-Kamen and Laurence Fishburne's charcters were so underdeveloped that I couldn't care less about them. Maggie( Judy Greer) and Jim( Bobby Cannavale) were unnecessary and you can throw them out of the movie without worrying about changing the storyline. But still, kudos to the writers for making such an impressive introduction to the Wasp.As for acting, most of the cast did they part, especially Evangeline Lilly. She is the perfect Wasp and created a great chemistry between Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd is great as always, but I felt like he should have been given more things to do this time around. He was a very smart character in the original Ant-Man, but they made him a complete dummy this time around.The worst part about this film is how they completely wasted the Quantum Realm. There is so much potential , but they just ignored it. I hope they show more of the Realm in the upcoming Avengers 4.All in all, this was a very fun and enjoyble film. Despite some obvious flaws, Peyton Reed did try his best to improve what was not good enough in the first film and helped the film stand out among Black Panther and Infinity War. Recommended for families or those who just want to have a good time in the theater."
638,10,"Amazing storyline, great humor I laughed so much when watching this film! It has an amazing storyline as well as great humor. There also is wonderful CGI and acting. There are a lot of characters in this film, but I never became confused or overwhelmed.Ant-Man and the Wasp takes place around the same time that the film Avengers: Infinity War (another film in the MCU series) takes place. It shows what Ant-Man is up to while the rest of the avengers are fighting a war. There are a lot of hilarious jokes that I enjoyed, but younger children might not understand. There also is a little bit of bad language in this film.Paul Rudd, who plays the main role of Ant-Man / Scott Lang, is such an incredible actor. In some of the uncomfortable scenes, he really gets into his character and is unfazed by some of the weird stuff he does. He is also a hilarious character and brings comedy to this action filled film which makes it even more enjoyable. Hannah John Kamen, who plays the role of Ghost (a new character who was affected by the Quantum Realm and now has powers), is also a very good actress. Just through her face she expresses so much desperation and sadness. Even though the things that she does are violent and unnecessary, you can't help but have empathy for her.The CGI in the Quantum Realm is out of this world. Even though I have never seen anything like it before, all of the movement and colors make it seem real. It is truly incredible that they are able to make a world that we have never seen before look as if it is real and not like some imaginary magical world.My favorite part of the film would be a spoiler. So instead I'll talk about my favorite character, Jimmy Woo, the detective. He is my favorite character because, first of all, he is extremely hilarious when working or talking with Scott. Second, he is such a determined and hardworking character. He really wants to do his job right. Even though he isn't perfect, I still give him credit for working so hard.There are multiple morals in this film. The ones that stand out to me are about family and helping others. Hope Pym (Evangeline Lilly), the daughter of the Wasp who gets stuck in the Quantum Realm, misses her mom so much and does everything she can to rescue her. But the Ghost also needs the Wasp to save herself which would be fatal to the Wasp. I don't want to give too much away, but they both need the same thing and they have to find a way to make it work. Whether that is through just fighting it out or other means.As you can probably tell, I was intrigued the whole time watching this film and I really enjoyed it. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18. Adults too will enjoy this film. You should definitely check it out to see what happens!Reviewed by Jolleen M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

639,7,"A Fun Ride This movie has some tung in cheek fun espcially with the FBI. The FBI looks hopelessly inept in consipiring with an idiot bad guy to try and steal the science that makes Ant Man possible. Not surprising that the government fares so poorly, it has been doing so for a long time in the super hero world. It just gets an exclaimation point here.The film has heart as it introduces the story through the child (daughter) who loses her mother (Wasp) because mom needs to save the world. Worst obvious reason to lose your mom. In a way the plot is a little worn, but you have to remember Stan Lee wrote this stuff in the 20th Century. The movie is updated though.The movie starts slowly explaining exactly what it is going to do and then speeds up and does it. It is not the jumbled mess of ""Infinity Wars"" earlier this summer. The acting is very good with Michael Douglas and Michelle Peiffer aging gracefully in supporting roles. Paul Rudd is the main man and there are 2 other women who are major distractions. Evangline as the young hot Wasp and Hannah as a strange Ghost do just fine.The humor in this one is typical Marvel which unfortunately is better than most of the comedy films going lately. Going to see the latest Mama Mia soon to see how it compares. The director is the same guy who did the original Any Man. The incredible shrinking and expanding plus technical malfunctions are in place, just like the real world.I keep hoping to see something more entertaining than Marvel movies, but it does not look like the summer of 2018 is going to have any. Will this have more humor than Mama Mia? Almost certainly, though will check that out soon and let you know. Mama Mia will defintely be bigger, size wise, than ants."
640,3,"Not as good as the first Ant-Man. in fact it sucks. Not what I expected at all. Very boring to sit through, Terrible villains, Way way way too much stuff about the quantum realm, Movie seemed more of a rescue mission there instead of a action comedy movie. Some of the jokes get old like the suit not working right at all, And that cop hugging Scott and seeming like he's in love with him. This movie falls in the not as good as the first list marvel seems to be having from my point of view. GOTG Vol 2 wasnt good, The Winter Soldier wasnt that good. Dont get you're hopes up for a funny or action packed movie."
641,7,"Solid fun film Really enjoyed this movie. Fun, great likeable characters, great pacing. Fun sense of humor. Great movie."
642,10,"The Story of Ant Man Continues The sequel to Ant Man was fun for me, Ant Man is one of marvels unique stories and this second one didn't disappoint. The story is good as it connects in a way to Marvels: Avengers: Infinity War and it reveals characters that were unknown before.Ant Man is joined by the Wasp and the duo make a great team. Hank Pym discovers that his wife is still alive and he plans on rescuing her. And a new villain makes an appearance but she is not really a villain. Ant Man is a unique character to the MCU and I really did enjoy it.10/10 for Ant Man and the Wasp"
643,8,"Good sequel - better than part 1 It was a good sequel that I liked more than the first part because it had more interesting and personal story. It was not your typical MCU fare but really had an individual and also emotional story to tell. Paul Rudd was fun but it was Evangeline Lilly who was the scene stealer along with a fine Michael Douglas. Michelle Pfeiffer was unfortunately a bit underused, I hoped for more of her acting weapons. Michael Pena was again the scene stealer. Laurence Fishburne had some good moments. The action was good as well as the visual effects. Good score and cinematography mix it up as a nice fun adventure. The screenplay makes sure we get interesting characters and conflicts. I loved the post credit scene which made me wish for much more quick. Ant-Man is probably the most underrated Marvel hero but here he proved his qualities as a leading hero. The connections between the characters was what kept me interested from the beginning to the end."
644,8,"Quality Sequel Could it be that rare sequel, that is far better than the original?"
645,6,"A decent dessert after Infinty War main course I just got out of the theater and thought I should write a review ASAP. Probably because I have been waiting for so long to see the film. Here it is:WHAT I LIKE:The film is much more brighter and funnier than Infinity WarPaul Rudd with his humour and Evangeline Lilly with her flexibility makes a perfect duoAfter Infinity War, this is what we need to get over the SNAPWHAT I DON'T LIKE:The film doesn't have a main villain, which makes our herores too comfortableAll in all, the film may not be as exciting and original as the first film, but was still an enjoyable experience and successfully introduced my new favorite female superhero- the Wasp."
646,10,"Good Movie with Good scenery and the close ups scenes. I didn't really like the comedy half way though the Movie, the comedy just fell flat but the other half was really good and made me laughI think that this Movie was a little bit better then the first, which isn't always the case with sequels, I liked most of the action scenes I love how creative some of them were but I think it could have been a little better and interesting like it was in the first Ant-man Movie. I liked that it had connections to other Movies, I haven't watch infinity war yet so that is on my to watch list.I like at the start of the Movie we have a scene with Hank and we have a little recap of the first Movie, I think it was a good idea for the views because of the year gap. the first ant man Movie came out in 2015 and this Movies came out in 2018. I really liked the imagination and creative in this Movie. I like Scott's relationship with his daughter, Cassie, there was a scene in the Movie of Scott playing with Cassie, were they went on there own mission, which was really cute. I found this Movie kind of relatable there was a scene where Scott was reading a sad book and he starts to cry. Which was me when I read that book.I liked Luis he was funny and I really liked Scott's scenes with him, I liked the music that was used and the use of lighting, and the use of technology. I found the Movie funny, and I really liked Scott's magic and his singing. I really enjoyed Jimmy and Scott scenes I found them really funny.I think that hope was good as the wasp, I did find the one villain, the ghost a bit creepy at times. I felt sorry for Ava because what she had to go though, I think that all the acting was really good. I enjoyed the scenery and the close ups scenes."
647,7,"Just Fun & Inventive. While the villains are weak (typical of the MCU overall) this movie is a worthy sequel to Ant-Man.I think there's a group looking to slam this film with excessively negative reviews. No clue what their endgame is, unless they're DC loyalists tired of Marvel winning out repeatedly.Whatever the case may be, I'm looking forward to the further adventures of Scott Lang. And plenty of others are as well."
648,8,"I think the movie was fun I liked this movie although sonetimes things that happened didn't make sense, still i liked it and I will watch it again!"
649,10,Cinema Hall Review A Hundred and Fifty for a ticket and an 'Captain America' hero called Ant-Man turned up on screen whom we went to see. The movie called 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' brought filmography to our eyes and stimulated us for the duration of the entire film screening; likely to read a review. The 'Ant Man and The Wasp' are a set; two hundred and fifty words per review. The movie offered pop corn and cool drinks like cola to be purchased with the movie ticket which brought a pleasant 'input' to a not so pleasant seating arrangement because this reviewer lead two others to get seats nearby because of the attention that was grasped by buying tickets and cola or 'Coca cola' with the show and standing and watching people come down through the elevators at the cinema hall. The two strangers who took seats beside me were aware that the seats had me by their side because they had brought 'Coca Cola'. Coca Cola is the drink that has 'Cocain' inside; little bit the sugar by twenty to a cup did not let it. The syrup like mixture that after cinema halls are not found in residences are a soda or air rated drink consumed to prevent burps.
650,6,"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee - but it succeeds only partially These 120 minutes we got here are the second Ant-Man movie and the newest addition to the billion-$ grossing Marvel franchise. You read about the two protagonists in the title already and as Marvel has been doing a lot recently, they are adding superheroes left and right and this one is not just about Ant-Man anymore at the core of it all. Peyton Reed returns, he was also in charge of directing the first, but he is not one of the many writers working on this 2018 film we have here. But one of them is Paul Rudd, who of course plays the title character. From goofball comedies over idiot brother to leading a Marvel superhero franchise. Not too shabby for him. Good for him as I like him, here and in other stuff. He brings some known formulas here, but in general, this is not the typical Marvel movie. The main reason for that is that we do not have a global danger, or an antagonist who wants to destroy mankind or a big city or at least enslave everybody, but it's much more a personal story as Wasp's human form wants to find her mother again, who disappeared decades ago and with the help of Ant-Man (and his human form) and her father we get to witness how they move closer and further away from this achievement. The antagonists are also not that epic, or that evil you could say. They have motivations you can understand, but their approaches may not be right, at least in terms of the only evil character with superpowers. Then there is of course Walton Goggins' gang, who will be a delight to watch for everybody hopefully, not just fans of Justified. The truth serum running gag is just an absolute highlight we have here in this film from start to finish. And then you could say that the FBI or whoever was chasing Rudd's character and the scientists were also more clumsy antagonists than really enemies that could be taken seriously (same applies to Goggins, more of a nuisance than a threat). As for Rudd, I thought he was great fun to be honest. He had some really good comedic lines and it's nice to see him not take himself so seriously. Downey jr.'s and Cumberbatch's characters can learn a lot from him. The film's reference to technology and science is one that made this film look a bit similar at times to Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange movie, but yeah, Rudd is of course the far more gifted actor.What else? Laurence Fishburne is always fun to be honest, but sadly his story line was a bit underwhelming and he would not have been missed if he had been out of the picture the moment he gives this hint to our heroes. As for Michelle Pfeiffer, I would have hoped for a better story as well, but that's the curse with superhero films I guess. Not even her mind taking over Ant-Man's body felt particularly right. Or her approach to curing the main antagonist. Oscar winner Michael Douglas is on board too and all about the more serious moments, not really the comedy, although his school boy joke is okay and better than pretty much everything Michael Peña has to work with, the one man who is really only in it for the comedy. Or maybe his line delivery is just bad, this could be the reason too, but luckily Rudd nails all these lighter parts too, which makes this a film that is actually very funny on several occasions. You will recognize them when you see them. I said this is a pretty different Marvel film already, but it also elaborates on important subjects like change in size, shrinking, growing and also the reference to nature, animals in particular, is an interesting one that is not as common as you may think when it comes to the big screen career of Marvel films from the last more than a decade. The effects are of course top-notch as always, especially the animated ants.Still, this is not a film that will make too many waves in a year in which the new Avengers film really tore everything down and yes it was this great, so the new Ant-Man won't get a great deal of awards attention I suppose. But it's not a bad film by any means. Very fitting that the post-credit sequence is perhaps more memorable than everything before that with the reference to the Avengers film. But if it happens at the exact same time as the battle versus Thanos, then how come we never hear anything about that during the movie. It looks good the ending and feels shocking, but well the more you think about it, the less sense it makes I suppose. Anyway, the charming protagonist makes up for some occasional flaws in writing and these 2 hours really go by very quickly. I think, unless you really oppose superhero films, you should check this one out. It's a pretty decent achievement. Oh yeah, from a personal perspective, I could not care less about T.I and even his fans have no reason to watch this one because his screen time is so limited and it's all about the comedy, not the music, but I did enjoy the Morrissey/Smiths references on some occasions."
651,7,"A great superhero film! Ant man and the Wasp is a successful sequel that contains comical moments like the first movie. The special effects and storytelling add elements of science into the MCU. We can see the film being more creative with the idea of ""Pym Particles"" where objects are being enlarged and downsized more frequently.One great thing about the film is the relationship between Hope and her mother, Janet. Like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this film explore the idea of love extending beyond space and time, and the writers did so with the details that were already established in the story. The relationship between the main two female characters can be described as a game of hide and seek, Hope's motivation in the film is simply finding her motivation her, like how she always lost the game in her childhood.But all movie came with imperfection. Once again, like the previous film, Hank Pym's character is poorly developed. The film villian Ghost, exist because of him being a jerk at the first place by not acknowledging her father's work. Yet the conflict between the characters resolved without Pym being forced to change. He was the same egotistic douche described in his youth at the end the of film. There were no apologies or struggles or choices touched to change his character.Generally, the film is entertaining to watch. It's my personal favorite Marvel in 2018. Since the film is dedicated to the main characters, the recently reunited family's death were made sadder than the ones in the Infinity War."
652,9,"The quantum Realm just opens a whole new Door for the MCU! Ant man and the wasp Was Definitely What was needed after Avengers infinity war's tragic ending, it's also what was needed to open a whole new door for the MCU! The overall review for the film itself was 9/10, has a good mix of Serious,Humor,And action sequences. There were also great visual effects and a great soundtrack, so in conclusion a great Film That is a medication for The Avengers infinity war ending!"
653,10,Fun entertainment . Ignore the low rating reviews. This is a fun and enjoyable 2 hours . Paul Rudd and Michael Pena Characters made the movie for me.
654,3,"Exceptionally Mediocre and Very Near to Poor This ended up being just another typical Marvel film. Plot was predictable, plot armor was extremely thick, and jokes were often out of place and unfunny. If you want to glaze your eyes over and watch CGI fights play through, then go ahead and buy tickets to this movie. If you're looking for a good watch and an actual film, look elsewhere and don't contribute to this awful trend of low effort cinematography."
655,8,"Lots of fun for those of us who seek ENTERTAINMENT Some people go to super-hero movies to make themselves feel sophisticated when they aren't. The rest of us go to superhero movies to be entertained and this film does exactly that-- it's a lot of fun, highly inventive and very, very funny. Make sure you see the first film before this one or you might be slightly lost at times for the sequel. If you NEED to see worlds destroyed or massive convoluted plots and more characters than you can follow, just to be satisfied by a film, don't bother with this one, and especially don't bother reviewing it. This is a FUN film, not a self-important film.All these one-star reviews are by 12-year-olds (mentally at least) who have often not even seen the trailer let alone the film itself; they can be ignored with a laugh. I'm finding out that a lot of people watch superhero movies to avoid thinking about their own inadequacies, and then go blamestorming if one of these total-childish-nonsense movies doesn't have a story which puts all of humanity at risk while trying to be the new Citizen Kane (a reference none of them will recognize I'm sure). It's pathetic to see people getting angry just because others are having fun. These are frigging comic books, folks, not historical literature, and you're just ruining your own genre by taking it SOOOO seriously."
656,6,"The song Everything is Awesome should be this movies theme. Until you are sick of it! It's rather low calorie. Scott isn't in trouble, even when he's in trouble. They even altered the strained relationship with his Ex and her husband. Really hammering home everybody just loves Paul Rudd! Even his assigned government agent who The movie writers think doubles as parole officer. The Villain isn't really one. Basically everybody is mad that Hank Pym USED TO BE A PRICK! That's the main conflict in this movie. Hank you used to be a tool!You find out Hope and Hank aren't talking to Scott. Yeah how long will that last, he's Paul Rudd, everybody loves Paul Rudd..yay.The Wasp is absolutely ass kicking all through this movie. It made me start to think why did Hank need Scott again? Ohh right, He's Paul Rudd, everybody loves Paul Rudd ! It's like it's his actually superpower.When Judy Greer and Bobby Canavale group hugged Rudd I threw up a little, not gonna lie.That was this movie Jumping the PEZ!"
657,10,"Very Entertaining Even though it is not the best marvel movie, it is a very fun and entertaining experience. It is thrilling and well made, with some bits of lacks in plot. The journey to finding the lost parent, the absence of a true antagonist and the lack of explanation of the quantum void and the survival inside it. However, all in all, it is a truly entertaining experience one that us marvel fans needed after Infinity War!"
658,7,"Marvel's Back to The Future After Avengers: Infinity War I was worried that anything that would come after for Marvel would be underwhelming but I was wrong because AntMan and the wasp used the same formula as the last Ant man movie which was that it was a small story and a family oriented story inside a superhero movie.The Whole premise is Janet Van Dym Hank Pym's wife is trying to get saved from the Quantam while AntMan is underhouse arrest.The story was simple enough and built Aroundt which is why it was so good.The first act was a tad slow but not boring is it set up where the characters are and had some fun action especially with the introduction of the Wasp.The second act was a kind of boring with the pace diping and nothing exciting happening.The third act picked up the pace and the chunk of the action was in the last 30 minutes so that was my favorite part.The villain or antagonist of the movie Ghost wasn't bad but not really that interesting she has a reason to be there but didn't add anything significant with the plot expect for fancy powers which made for good effects.Michael Douglas' performance amd Pual Rudd were the best characters in the movie as they were serious when needed to be and funny when needed to be.The Wasp as I said was cool with as a good enough performance from lilly.Michelle Pfeiffer did well in the role she was given and had good chemistry in the scenes she had with Michael Douglas.Antman and the Wasp was funnier than the first one but of course its Marvel but It had some out of place humor that took away from the serious moments but of course again its Marvel.This had more action as well but mainly in the last 40 minutes or so because as I said the second act was mostly slow and kind of dragged on.So what to take away from all of this is that Antman and the wasp is similar to Back to the Future its funny,has a story with a heart and just a plain fun blockbuster."
659,10,Loved this movie This was my favorite movie of the year. Great actors. It was very funny and worth watching.
660,8,"What a fun little movie! Our group had tons of fun while indulging ourselves in this slice of the MCU! We don't get all those 1 Star Reviews. It was tons better than a lot of REALLY bad movies out there...The build up and story was a classic 3 parities, 1 McCuffin, in form of a shrunken lab. The jokes came with a spot on delivery and the action was absolutely solid! The size-changing was brilliantly executed and felt comic booky as hell! Which was absolutely a good thing!Compared to the emotional weight of Infinity War, this felt light hearted and fun."
661,6,"Entertaining, waiting for Avengers 4 I saw this with my son and we both enjoyed this movie. This movie had its light hearted, chuckle moments, like the first one. It had some heart felt moments as well. However, the story was s little stale and the Ghost character lacked depth. I'm not an avid comic book reader, so I do not know everything about Ghost. It was a little disappointing that the plot involved a Mcguffin. In my opinion (not worth ten cents) this was a little bit of lazy writing. There is a lack of explanation as to how a person can survive for 30 years in the quantum realm (evolve?) Regardless, it's a fun movie! Stay tuned fir the end credits that tie into previous events!"
662,8,Great Class how marvel put out these movies always different. What's next?
663,10,"One more master comedy by MCU after Ragnarok Marvel's Ant Man and The Wasp is one of the best movie of MCU and of 2018. With the master comedy, awesome action sequences, awesome vfx, drama, father-daughter chemistry, thriller, supehero this movie is lifetime watchable. Also It is watchable with your family."
664,1,"Bad Everything. This movie was doomed from the first frame and it never got better. I regret wasting my time watching it all the way through. It offered no compelling reasons to buy into the concept of ""big and small"". To top that, the ""Good Daddy and Cute Daughter"" subplot is worn out and dead. Nothing makes sense. Nothing is cleaver. Nothing is funny."
665,4,"Fun Head-Scratcher Leans too heavily into humor; the light-heartedness is a staple of the MCU, but here, it undercut too much, and some jokes felt forced. Some good recurring jokes do land, but they are few and far between. Also, some character motivations left me scratching my head. I was left with some confusing questions, especially regarding one character, and I'm hoping that was left open to be explained in the future, as opposed to being left open because no one could think of a good explanation. What saves this movie are the great effects in the action scenes, especially concerning the characters changing sizes during fights."
666,7,"Pretty good actually I actually quite liked this film. It certainly wasn't bad. In fact, it's my 9th favorite movie in the mcu. Now it could have been better, but I really enjoyed it. But to be honest, the villian wasn't that great. As much as I like this film, I will admit that yellow jacket from the first one was a better villian."
667,9,"BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!!!!!!! First of all the story was amazing, and the actors were great. I saw every thing I'd hoped to see and more.But I want to talk a little bit more about the plot of the film. Ant-Man/Paul Rudd was seen last in captain America civil war he was in jail, but at the end of civil war it shows captain America walking into the jail, it doesn't show anything that happens after that. but later in Avengers Infinity War captain America is seen with falcon, who was previously in jail. So Ant-Man got out too. I liked the idea of Hank Pym and hope on the run threw out the movie, and Scott is stuck at home.The whole idea was great, but the only thing is, when the movie started close to the beginning we see the villain ghost, you know nothing about her. I wish before she had her first fight with Ant-Man and The Wasp it showed how she came to be. But that doesn't really matter muchAnd every one was wondering where Ant-Man was well infinity war was happening, well it turns out he had no idea that any of that was going on.Now I want to quickly jump to Bill Foster, him and Hank Pym have a history together they used to work on a project together but they stopped after a while. I would have liked to see a flash back scene to Hank and Bill working together.But overall great fantastic film. Can't wait to see Ant-Man in avengers 4"
668,8,"Fun and entertaining I am not really into the Marvel; DC superhero type movies. But a friend wanted to check this out and I was okay with idea since the actors in the film are palatable, and the trailer looked cute.Overall the move was fun and entertaining. It's a flick the whole family can watch. I don't remember seeing any blood (okay, maybe a little) or gore and the fight scenes were not excessive.I did not see ""Ant Man"" but I do want to check it out now. The ending implied that there is more to come. I like how stories of the Marvel characters are interwoven.If you do go see it, I don't think you will be disappointed."
669,7,"As enjoyable as the first one, but it doesn't really go anywhere incredible in terms of the story. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a sequel that's glorified filler story while we all wait for Avengers: End Game (Avengers IV) to come out, but it's entertaining filler nonetheless. This movie knows it's a fun romp that doesn't take itself too seriously, though the comedy from the first one is essentially repeated in this movie. Both Ant-Man movies are good dumb fun that you don't really need to over-think or re-think like you probably did with Infinity War. And MARVEL keeps on going with its ever-so ambitious MCU franchise.Is this in my top 10 MCU movies? No; that doesn't diminish its good sense of fun and action sequences though. It's still good."
670,6,"Nice Nap!! This movie was super slow, I fought the sleepiness for most of the middle. Picked up nicely at the end."
671,4,"Ughhhhh!!! Ughhhh is the general feeling I have about this movie, the plot is terrible, everything is childish and as if the 6yrs olds were writing this with no guns no shooting but throwing giant PEZ at each other, the acting, that is tolerable to a degree, but then come the dialogues. CRINGE WARNING, it hurts to watch this movie without pretending to be stupid or deaf on the parts when thay talk."
672,10,"Just As Entertaining as the Original!!! ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is just as entertaining and sensational as its silly, CGI-laden origins predecessor ""Ant-Man."" For the record, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" picks up sometime after ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), so the sequel fits neatly into the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline. The impressive thing about ""Bring It On"" director Peyton Reed's sequel is the chemistry as well as the charisma that the ensemble cast generates as events alternate between larger-than-life and smaller-than-life. At times, this amusing, lightweight, action-packed epic turns into a good-natured, slap-happy, screwball comedy. No, the world doesn't teeter on the brink of disaster. No, the most despicable supernatural dastard in the galaxy-Thanos-hasn't come to destroy Earth. Nothing so monstrous as that happens in this movie! This suspenseful, often hilarious saga confines itself largely to domestic issues. The FBI has Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man, (Paul Rudd of ""Wanderlust"") under house arrest for having violated of the Sokovia Accords during his illegal escapades in Vienna with Captain America against the Avengers. Meanwhile, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas of ""Wall Street"") and his daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly of ""Real Steel""), still dodging the FBI, struggle to recover Hank's long, lost-in-limbo wife, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer of ""Batman Returns""), from the sub-atomic oblivion of the Quantum Realm. Ant-Man's Hispanic pal Luis (Michael Peña of ""Chips"") is still up to his ridiculous antics, spinning those long-winded tales, where everybody speaks with his voice in spite of visually being themselves! Indeed, virtually everybody from the first outing has returned for the follow-up.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" opens with stunning action set-piece that contains important backstory and foreshadows the outcome. We learn that the first Ant-Man was Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) joined him on a mission to disarm a nuclear Soviet missile. They were forced to shrink themselves, going sub-atomic, to get between the molecules of the casing and defuse the missile. Unfortunately, Ant-Man's outfit malfunctions, so Wasp must save the day. Janet defused the missile, but she found herself trapped in the Quantum Realm for 30 years. In the original film, our hero learned about the Quantum Realm. An individual can enter The Quantum Realm, lying beyond the bounds of time and space, by wielding either Pym's Particles or a 'sling ring' like Dr. Strange. Anybody who saw ""Dr. Strange"" (2016) may remember the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) gave Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) a glimpse of this mysterious alternate dimension. As the action warms up, Dr. Pym and Hope are working diligently on a way to retrieve Janet using a tunnel of sorts to the Quantum Realm. Actually, their Quantum Realm tunnel reminded me of a smaller version on the vintage ABC-TV show ""The Time Tunnel."" Furthermore, the characters ride in a chariot enclosed in a glass bubble that resembles a cross-between of a helicopter and a rocket sled.Reed and his quintet of scenarists: Chris Mackenna of ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,"" Erik Sommers of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming,"" Andrew Barrer of ""Haunt,"" newcomer Gabriel Ferrari, and star Paul Rudd have refreshed matters with a two new nemeses. Affable FBI Agent Johnny Woo (Randal Park of ""Dinner for Schmucks"") constantly harasses Scott Lang after Scott has been sentenced to wear an ankle monitor. Meantime, Sonny Burch (Walton Coggins of ""The Hateful Eight"") complicates life for both Dr. Hank Pym and Hope. Initially, Lang has fashioned a thrill ride of sorts from several huge cardboard boxes to keep his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson of ""Forever My Girl""), amused while he is confined to his apartment. While they are playing, they crash accidentally through the fence surrounding Scott's apartment. Scott's ankle monitor goes off and alerts an army of Feds. The FBI storm in to search the premises. Naturally, they find nothing. Mind you, Scott has been warned not to associate with either Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne. After the FBI leave, Scott contacts Hank on a burner phone about Janet. As it turns out, Hank has created a Quantum Tunnel with the help of unscrupulous go-between Sonny Burch, but Sonny wants to do the same thing Darren Cross did to Hank. Burch plans to sell Hank's technology on the black market. Our heroes tangle repeatedly with the FBI as well as Burch and his heavily armed henchmen. While they are contending with these conventional villains, they encounter the enigmatic Ghost a.k.a. Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen of ""Ready Player One"") who wants to appropriate Hank's sophisticated technology. This stealthy, supernatural, costume-clad foe is entirely new to the franchise. She can appear just as suddenly as she can disappear, but she has trouble controlling the duration of those appearances. Moreover, the sinister-looking Ghost isn't easily discouraged, and she surprises them every time she materializes out of the blue without warning.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" doesn't suffer from a shortage of outlandish action, relentless villains, and awesome set-pieces. Truly, Hank Pym has surpassed himself in this sequel. Not only has he managed to reduce the size of his city-block research laboratory building down to the size of a hatbox, but he also can roll it around like a suitcase on wheels with a handle! The whiplash changes in size for humans, buildings, and automobiles has multiplied beyond anything in the original. Hank has a Hot Wheels 30-Car Toy Storage Case with a variety of vehicles which he can change into full-sized vehicles. The careening chase with Burch and his henchmen smashing and crashing into Hank's van down a busy San Francisco street is exciting stuff. Ghost follows our heroes and gives them twice as much trouble. At one point, after he gets his hands-on Dr. Pym's hatbox-sized research lab, Burch tries to escape on a ferry. Suddenly, Ant-Man turns into a giant, plunges into the bay, wades out the ferry, and takes the lab away from him. Naturally, the FBI is in pursuit, too. ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is as hilarious as it is hair-raising."
673,9,"America is wondering whether this flick is REALLY suitable for . . . . . . date night. In a word, yes! Just as ""Plastics!"" was the main point of THE GRADUATE (a romantic comedy from the 1900s), subatomic miniaturization poses as the crux of ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. The possibilities here are endless. When ""M. Douglas"" retrieves his Main Squeeze from the Way Wee, she seems to be just as much of a geezer as he. But what if Reality does NOT work that way? Wouldn't it be more likely that--relieved of the stress of being big in a macro (or macaroni) sense--the original Wasp would have barely aged a day by the time her hubby belated reunites with her? What chick wouldn't fantasize about a world in which she's only on the hook for giving the best micro-seconds of her life to the groom? Similarly, what is it that has been the downfall of such famous Americans as Ted Bundy, Ed Gein, and Scott Peterson? The lack of miniaturization skills, of course. The latter gentleman went to all of the trouble of rowing his boat out to the middle of the ocean for the sweet sorrow of his parting, and where did it get him? Just think if ALL of Ted, Ed, and Scott's combined discards could be down-sized inside of a modest office building or mausoleum, and than wheeled away under the very noses of the M.I.A. poster people. This would add a whole new dimension to the ""Forensic Files"" shows!"
674,6,"Meh...it was okay Apparently you have to have seen Civil War and Infinity Wars before seeing this, alas I have not, so some of the references were a little obscure for me. However, the story itself was a little weak and honestly pretty thin. Luis was predictably funny, but almost too much. It was fun to watch, but in my opinion it had so much more potential and opportunity to be better. Hope was too blase, and Hank was just...one dimensional. The graphics for Ghost were the best part of it, they did a good job there. Glad I saw it at the drive in for half price, but really wish it had been a better movie all the way around."
675,10,Loved it The Marvel films are getting old. They're not interesting anymore (barring Dr. Strange). However the Ant Man movies are great! Action and adventure with a sprinkle of comedy. A fun watch.
676,7,"Light, Fun, Simple Superhero Movie Synopsis: Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is grappling with the consequences of his choices as both a superhero and a father. Approached by Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), Lang must once again don the Ant-Man suit and fight alongside the Wasp. The urgent mission soon leads to secret revelations from the past as the dynamic duo finds itself in an epic battle against a powerful new enemy.Plot - 3.5/5As mentioned in the title of this review, the plot on this movie is simple. It's an easy-going story, and it accomplishes what it promises, with some obstacles here and there, but overall pretty much ""easy"". Is a really comedic movie (which is probably the reason why you would want to see it), but it is barely thought-provoking. After having to really complex movies prior this one (Black Panther, Infinity War) it's understandable why many wouldn't like this movie. The plot isn't perfect, making things show up to benefit the plot and having characters just to support the Protagonists main decisions.Characters - 3/5Ant-Man and the Wasp make up for a great duo, both complementing each others strengths and weakneses. This movie seemed to benefit the Wasp a little bit more though, making Ant-Man a little stupid, which he is shown otherwise in the first movie. Michael Peña's character Luis is the stand out, being the main comedic character. Overall, the protagonists are pretty compelling. In the other hand, the antagonists are the worst part of the movie. Ghost has an interesting back story, but in the third act all the hatred and motivation she had of being a villain is thrown out the window for no reason. Also, Sonny Burch has no reason to show up in the movie other than make the characters mission harder to accomplish, which makes a completely useless character. Bill Foster's character is also a waste, just introduced to connect Ghost with the main characters.Acting - 5/5Acting is amazing overall. Rudd gives a charming performance as always, Lilly gives you a badass female superhero to root for, and Michael Peña gives a comedic performance, stealing every scene he is in. Pfeiffer and Douglas also steal the show, but their characters don't have enough screen time to apprecite. John-Kamen and Goggins also give solid performances, but at the end of the day their characters are a waste.Direction and Editing- 4.25/5Peyton Reed delivers an average film, but he doesn't fix any of the existing problems from the first Ant-Man movie. Not only does he not fix mistakes, but he adds more of them. Action scenes are really well developed, but just like the first movie, there aren't many of them. His villain problem also continues, and maybe this franchise won't get any better until he leaves completely. The Editing is really well done. It knows when to cut each scene, making the battle sequences easy to follow.Visuals and Soundtrack - 5/5The battle sequences are really cool to look at. The scenes involving tha size changes of both the wasp and Ant-Man really show the potential that Peyton Reed and his team had. Also, the visualization of Ghost powers is also really well executed, though it can cause a little bit of confusion during fast scenes. The Soundtrack it's really ""Pop Culture"", making the whole movie fun and cheering.Final Grade: B+"
677,8,"Better than the already amazing first one! Let me start off by saying, don't listen to the bad reviews. This film is great! It is not the best, I'll admit, but it is not, I repeat, IS NOT the wost film, MCU or ever. It is a Quantum-million miles away from the badness of The Incredible Hulk (apologies if you enjoy T.I.H.). It is packed with comedy and action. Michelle Pfeifer played a great part in the film. Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Douglas played the same characters they did in the first film, yet, they somehow managed to play them better. Hannah John-Kamen played a great villian, better than she did in Ready Player One. She was also pretty redeemable. Luis was 100,000,000,000,000 times better and funnier!!!!!! Sonny Burch wasn't in it much and could have been better, however.The story wasn't what I imaged an Ant man sequel to be, even with the ending of the first one in mind, I will say. But it did manage to be good and engaging.The action was what you would expect from an MCU film. It's PG-13 action. Not much gore. And, like the 1st film, Ant-man and the Wasp shows us how deadly an everyday object or toy could be with the Pym Particle.The mid-credits scene was, um, suprising.All in all a fun, funny, and awesome film, even if it isn't perfect. But, hey, what film is perfect?"
678,7,"Nothing super special Ant Man & The Wasp is a typical MCU movie. Action and CGI packed, colourful, nice story, child friendly. Sometimes the jokes are a bit too much and never take the movie to a higher level, except when Michael Peña does his super fast mimicking talking and explaining. For Marvel fans a must see...for others: please, first watch part 1. Like it? Run to the nearest cinema!"
679,9,"a great movie, despite what others say Alright, i have seen quite a bit of negative reviews on here. but while reading through those reviews, i noted a couple things. 1) people don't understand that this is SUPPOSED to be a comedic movie. the reason why ""serious"" scenes are interrupted by some joke or punchline is because it's not supposed to keep the audience tense and on the edge of their seat. 2) people don't understand the heart of who ant-man is. he's not some valiant superhero like captain america or thor who can knock out an opponent with one punch or flick of the wrist. he is first and foremost, a father. what drives him is his relationship with his daughter, so yes, a lot of the film is centered around that. but i think this adds a special element to the film that most other superhero movies do not have. scott has a lot to lose and a lot to motivate him, other than just ""being a hero and saving the day."" he has a family. scott is also not a professional superhero. yes, he is ant-man and has experience with the suit, however, he does not have the resources of shield or tony stark at his disposal so he cannot simulate advanced training missions and whatnot all the time. in fact, he is under house arrest, so he can't do anything superhero related anyway. and that is why scott is dependent on other people and why it is not called ""ant man 2"" but ""ant man and the wasp."" hope van dyne plays a key role in this film, not just acting as a love interest. she is a hero in her own right and is more experienced than scott. 3) the negative reviews forget about the gripping and thrilling action sequences in this film. it is a marvel movie after all and lives up to its name with all the fight scenes and car chases and special effects. i think all the characters in this movie were key to the plot, it was engaging, and a very fun movie. i enjoyed every minute of it."
680,10,"Thumbs up Loved everything about this movie. I can't imagine all the negative reviews from people complaining about storyline and acting. This is a Marvel comic turned movie so what great meaningful story can you expect. This is supposed to be sheer entertainment and it checks all the right boxes. Comedy, Action, brilliant Special Effects and really likeable characters. This movie was way better than the first part."
681,7,"Fun Campy Stylish Fun, campy, stylish. Great special effects. Decent jokes. I don't watch all the marvel films or follow the comics. So on its own I though it was one of the better marvel films. 6.8/10"
682,4,"Too much CGI with a boring storyline.. There was something about the kind of humor in this movie I didn't like. It was too much, not that funny and it felt a bit forced. It was was too corny I think. Especially Michael Douglas played too comical.Evangeline Lilly is pretty hot, but I'm afraid that's all she has. No real acting skills on her part which made her contribution to this movie meaningless. Another empty Hollywood production, a waste of production money.. I honestly dislike the quality of today's filmmaking. Why don't the so called executive producers start with an well written script instead of this cheap shallow bs. Just turn your brain off and watch this movie, you'll survive. And one day.. one day good movies will return.. one day.."
683,9,"A great addition to Infinity War franchise I honestly didn't see it coming, the end. I've enjoyed how Marvel's made sure every movie--Thor, Ant Man & The Wasp, Guardians, etc.--have all moved toward the ultimate battle.It's also just good ol' fun. My daughter thought it was great.This isn't a flat or just okay movie. It's fun with a surprise ending which shouldn't be when you reflect on it.Regardless, it's connected to IW, so you NEED to see it regardless."
684,6,"Not the Marvel we wanted but what we needed After the high drama emotion of Infinify War, ANT Man and the Wasp was just what we needed, fun and entertaining with out getting all serious. Paul Rudd pulls in another great performance which sets up to the next Avengers movie."
685,3,"Flat, boring and nothing new What can I say. Its a cash grab. A crappy boring film that does not have much substance. The jokes don't land the action is underwhelming and the story is just straight up garbage. Marvel is back to its typical villains and its sad because after infinity war and homecoming it was looking like marvel was making some 3 dimensional villains. But nope back to normal. The actors feel like they don't want to be there and it feels completely rushed and not thought out. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL.William"
686,1,"Really Huge marvel fan, but no, just no, boring, sooo boring my god, this lookes like they needed to make a quick movie about the whereabouts of ant man during infinity"
687,10,"I had a good time watching this film This is what we needed after infinity war,this film is a very funny comedy"
688,10,"Loved it, much less depressing than its Marvel predecessors I think this movie goes to show that you don't need a Hemsworth in order to make a superhero movie work. Funny wins :) although some Hemsworth never hurt anybody either!"
689,7,"Honestly, I enjoyed it since I went with my 8 year old brother. And if you went in there thinking this was gonna be a serious movie, you really did not watch the first one. For a PG-13 movie intended to be semi serious, I think they did a pretty good job. The original Ant- man showed similar comedic standards, and even the villians in the original antman weren't that strong, so I dont see why people are giving this movie a hard time. Laurence Fishburne I think is gonna be more important in the upcoming marvel movies, and I enjoyed his character the most. I also don't see why people were going into this thinking the villian had to be comparable to Infinity Wars and Black panther, considering ant man has no special powers whatsoever, and his only profession was being a conman. Seriously if you went in there thinking this movie was gonna be the next Comic action flick that was supposed to wow you like the avengers movies and black panther, then you seriously did not watch the first movie. I think the whole point is showing how someone who never was actually a hero can turn out to do extraordinary things in extreme circumstances. So I say, I enjoyed watching"
690,7,"Entertaining but underwhelming Story: ok, sorta felt all the stuff with the original Wasp and her powers was rushed and left something desired Comedy: good, obviously Michael Peña is great Action: cleaner than the original and good Overall: just another Marvel movie, a little stale, but entertaining"
691,2,"Just an another super hero movie Far from being as funny as The Guardians of the Galaxy and from the action and drama developed in Infinity War, this episode doesn't add up anything significant to the Marvel Cinematic Universe storyline. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your money on this movie. Totally forgettable."
692,7,"You got Pezzed This is another Marvel film with the usual suspects but with plots that have been going off a cliff. The chronology of this one places it after the Thanos disaster, I believe, although it wasn't overly clear as the event seemed to be a non-issue. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) teams up with Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) to rescue her mother from some quantum world. The explanation of what was going on was extreme techno-weenie double talk as Paul Rudd points out ""Do you guys just put 'quantum' in front of everything?"" Now they just can't go in and rescue her without various factions interfering.Stan Lee had a decent cameo. The film was not as funny or as good as the first one. Now what I didn't grasp was the double shrinking. It would seem to be once a building was shrunk and riding around in a van, it couldn't be shrunk a second time. If it could, why wouldn't you do that and conceal it better from the bad guys?"
693,9,"""ANT MAN AND THE WASP""- MY REVIEW Ant man and the Wasp, directed by Peyton Reed, is a fun filled adventure and exactly the kind of popcorn entertainment. Now after Infinity War, you expect a movie coming after it from the MCU to be a masterpiece. But Ant man and the Wasp, a little more superior to its predecessor, is about shrinking heroes, but also proves that size ""really"" doesn't matter.Now to the plot....Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope (Evangaline Lily) Is on a mission to bring back Janet( Michelle Pfeier), who is Pym's wife, who is stuck in the Quantam Realm. Meanwhile Scot a.k.a Ant man (Paul Rudd) Is under house arrest for violating the Sokovia Accords and for aiding Captain America. How he helps Hope and Hank forms a major part of the story. Meanwhile threat arises in the form of Ghost a.k.a Ava ( Hannah John Kamen) who has something to do with Hank's past..The screenplay of the film is highly engaging and doesn't bore u even for a minute. The movie had a lot of jokes, thanks to the main trio and Michael Pena as Scott's friend Luis. The action scenes, like the first movie, we're thrilling, funny and most importantly fresh. There is no world destruction thankfully here. The visual effects, background score, editing etc.. we're done neatly.Now to the performances... The film's soul is the trio of Paul, Michael and Evangeline. Paul is as always dependable. Michael gets a lot to do be it the comedy scenes or the dramatic one's. Evangeline springs a pleasant surprise. She didn't had to contribute much in the last film but here she shows her capability. Michael Pena was really good. Hannah John as the Ghost may not be as menacing as the recently seen villains in the MCU, but still delivers a sincere performance. Michelle Pfeier appears in the concluding moments. The rest of the supporting cast, the old and the new ones , we're good.So all in all ANT MAN AND THE WASP delivers terrific entertainment. Go for it!!!My rating : 4.5/5PS: Wait for the mid-credit scene. It is gonna shock u for sure....."
694,7,"The trailer had all the good moments I didn't see the chemistry we were promised in the trailer between the two leads. There were awkward scenes at the beginning where it seemed they could barely look at eachother. When the funny trailer scenes happened, I saw them coming from 3 miles away...rendering them not funny in the actual movie. Why did they turn Ant-Man into Pee-Wee Herman in this movie? He was doing incredibly weird things. He had a waterslide attached to upper level of his house. WEIRD. There is a scene when he opens the front door and leans outside to the point his chest is nearly touching the porch. WEIRD. The villain is also extremely weak. It didn't help her that during the scene Lawrence Fishburn was explaining everything, he kept getting interrupted by the ANNOYING phone ringing. The first time that phone rang, I knew it would ring two more times and annoy me. It annoyed Lawrence Fishburn and it also annoyed me. That is the one scene that CANNOT be interrupted by a silly joke. I was excited about Marvel possibly achieving a 4 billion dollar year in 2018. Black Panther and Infinity War well exceeded my box office expectations. All this movie had to do was be decent. Now I'm not sure that a 4 billion dollar year will happen."
695,8,"Ant-man and the Wasp had memorable funny moments! Quantum realms, super size, and shrinking size. Paul Rudd has funny moments. Michael Pena is hilarious. The plot is about rescuing Hank's wife from the quantum realm. But all that might change. Damn you Thanos!What I find annoying was Hank's new suit keeps malfunctioning. He can not go back to normal size and every time the Wasp has to save him. The villains were weak. Could not beat the first movie.Ant man and the Wasp was funny and good. But had a disappointing rescuing plot. But a great plot for infinity war. Can't wait for Avengers 4."
696,8,"Funny, Summer action It's marvel and their great CG. It's Rudd , Pena and other funny sidekicks. It recurring gags. The plot is a little cumbersome, but the action keeps it moving. The scenes with Rudd and his daughter are real, funny and a great part of the movie. It's not high drama, but it's fun and worth the ride."
697,6,"Pleased, but disappointed The trailer for this movie didn't win me over when I first saw it so I didn't didn't enter the theater with any expectations. I came out pleased but I felt that Marvel could have done better. The felt very lazy, and while the main villain did have motivation, the motivation felt sloppy and almost like it was crafted in less than five minutes. Antman's character and persona felt drastically different from the first film and he goes from a intelligent and strong hero to a dumb stumbling sidekick. But beside that and some others things I won't get into, the action, comedy and energetic fun from the first film was there and the movie felt somewhat faster paced than its predecessor. So in the end I did have fun and seeing this but I just felt that marvel could have done better in the long run."
698,3,"Not as good as you expected it to be... Disappointed! Saw this on Saturday July 7th at a 5:10 PM time. It was a waste of a goof marvel film which I had high hopes for since the first one! I was waiting for 3 years since the announcement came that Ant-Man will be getting a sequel and I was excited because I enjoyed the first Ant-Man movie!The whole storyline is basically trying to get the Quantum Realm hooked up to get Janet! (Hope's Mother) It gets taken away from them, then they get it back, gets taken away, gets it back! It's so repetitive that it feels like a boring movie! Except for the action scenes maybe, but that doesn't stop us of how bad the storyline is!Then there's Scott being held by the Government Police in his house which felt not really interesting. They could of just erased it or let them cut him off at the beginning earlier, but at least on the 3rd one they won't be!And the jokes were not good, I laughed a little bit from the inside and chuckled a little on the outside. There was one that was unfunny and felt unnecessary of Scott Lang replying back to Hope ""George Washington or Lincoln"" (You know which one I'm talking about) and no one laughed at it.Actions were good! I enjoyed them and the fighting scenes! The CGI was good too! I didn't liked much of the school scene but thought it was okayish.... The Villian had a little back story but could of had an ending from the first film knowing that she's coming or Scott having those visions of Janet from the Quantum Realm as a cliffhanger.Villain felt like one of the weakest one of the MCU and I was a little disappointed! The effects were great! Villain, not so much! She basically wants the Quantum Realm so she can be fixed or healed! And it goes back and fourth AGAIN! Until Janet heals her!Also, a little side Note to Marvel: HIRE EDGAR WRIGHT FOR THE NEXT ANT-MAN MOVIE! NOT PEYTON REED!"
699,3,"What a Joke! I truly don't get what's going on with Marvel these days. It seems they are delving towards action-comedy. If that's true then well-done to them for pulling it off with this movie. It's childish, it's cocky and it's boring and very predictable and unbelievable (well not for a kid). The only time the movie actually got my attention was at the very end apart from that, I think it's a total waste of time."
700,7,"Big Fun, Little Meaning Ant-Man and the Wasp is yet one more milestone in Marvel's lucrative super-powered saga - one more feather to add to CEO Kevin Feige's cap. Now would seem like a suitable moment to marvel (get it?) at the unprecedented feat this man's studio has accomplished - that of producing twenty distinct, sequential, feature-length movies in a single decade - as we rest for a spell in this juncture between epics, and await the end of the MCU (for better or worse) as we know it. Who knows what Phase 4 will bring? In the meantime, I will pick apart Ant-Man and the Wasp and assess its' worthiness to join its' comrades.Although I'm aware such messages won't phase many viewers, personally the forceful (if not downright propagandistic) underscoring of the themes of divorce and femininism present in this apparently self-declared ""family-first"" adventure throws a considerable shadow over what would otherwise be a mostly harmless work of entertainment. In my mind, people should recall the missteps Star Wars has so recently made (to the great infamy of the franchise and disgruntlement of the fans) and apply those lessons to Marvel, who surely will ruin their currently flourishing enterprise if they continue advocating for this uncalled-for ""diversity"". And to depict a happy family with divorced parents is a lie, plain and simple. Let alone the plethora of hardships and griefs which so constantly plague and harrass divorcees, and bring to mind what bewildered confusion any offspring who chance to be born into such unstable circumstances must undergo as a result of their parents' tragic situation. No, this nice, ""healthy"" relationship the film-makers are so evidently biased towards is nothing but a brazen lie. A pain-inducing lie, whose only fruit is misery. Through subtly offering divorce as a means of escape, director Peyton Reed suggest an alternative - a Pandora's box of suffering and chaos.Tonally, most would liken the sequel to 2015's Ant-Man, and rightly so. Here you have a unique corner of the comic-book world - one which hits upon a very light, very comedic note, which characteristically involves plenty of action, albeit of an especially breezy, upbeat nature. Egotistic quips and visual gags are vastly popular staples across the family of Marvel instalments, yet rarely do they let slip the more urgent themes so as to embrace the comedy so wholeheartedly as Ant-Man and the Wasp, loaded with laughs aplenty as it is. In my opinion, the sequel improves on the original, scaling up the jokes and gimics of the first, while shrinking its' defects (whatever those were, as my comment was naturally played entirely for effect!). In any case, a fresher feel sets this newer movie a step ahead of the original. That being said, it shares minimum involvement with the greater goings-on in the general world-stage of the MCU. Hearkening back to its' predecessor once again, one may expect a neat, isolated adventure set largely in its' own, friendly little (or sometimes rather giant!) world, which, after a ponderous opening and surprisingly action-lacking mid-section, brings us to a really fun climax that includes most of the movie's action, and certainly the most satisfying part overall. One of the harsher (and perhaps unfair) adjectives I could cruelly suggest concerning the plot would be the word ""meaningless"". The story is fine - it just doesn't impact anyone or anything else very much. This may irk some; it may leave others nonplussed. Only mind that this tale shares precious few links to the greater scheme which stupified fans earlier this year.Two words on characters and acting: Michael Peña! This man truely does steal the show - definitely a highlight of the fun. Yet although the casting is mostly spot-on, the characters typically lack a depth and moral and emotional quality that, were it to exist, would elevate the film to a new level (I'm looking at you, Marvel). Here I blame the writers more for incompetency in forming characters with meaning and personality than I blame the actors. In our age of sequels, tonnes of characters are played only to a ""satisfactory"" level, filling shoes without bringing anything more than the bare necessities to the role. Certainly in this movie, but also all over the MCU, shallow villains and heroes alike too often dominate the screen. The characters are good - but not outstanding.If you're anything like me, you'll find yourself humming that catchy little Ant-Man theme incessantly days in a row after seeing this movie. Christopher Beck's score encapsulates perfectly the quirky silliness of the movie's antics at all the right times, yet also displays a thorough command of the more serious-spirited side of things when needed.Ant-Man and the Wasp is probably best described as a real ""fun"" time. Laughs and action in abundance make popular crowd-pleasers as the movie opts for a conventional approach which is likely to please everybody all round to a degree. While iffy on the morals, it doesn't stint on smooth (and often amusing) effects and a catchy score. Other setbacks (depending on your opinion) may include some weak stunts and unimagintive scriptwriting. Nevertheless, Marvel continues to rule the box office and the hearts of fans world-wide with an ever-increasing roster of quality entertainment, which, given its' size and complexity, approaches something like television show status. I've seen three Marvel films in the cinema; two of them I saw this year. If my cinema attendance is indicative of the larger audience, then it's proof that our favourite big-screen superheroes are not going away anytime soon."
701,8,Well Umm It's Okay. Best Scene: Inside the Quantum Real !! Worst Scene: Confrontation At Ghost's Hideout.....So i was pretty Excited to see another Marvel movie after the Grand Infinity war & deep inside i know how good the movie will be i wont feel satisfied.its a pretty Good Movie & that's all about it. Well i love it maybe because i love marvel But it does nothing that much to make this movie Memorable Or any particular scenes at all. It just a filler as it contributes Nothing toward the whole MCU.But this does not means its a bad Movie. Its good in its own domain & worth a Watch.
702,5,"Eh it was ok It embraced some Marvel cliches and also ignored a few, if you're interested in the Infinity War stuff, just google the after credits scene and watch them on youtube or something I guess? It was meh"
703,10,"A fun sequel! Honestly don't see why there's so much negativity on some of these reviews, guys! This was a fun film. Sure it's not as magnificent as the preceding Infinity War or doesn't have the same depth as Black Panther or Winter Soldier, but it was wholly entertaining, heartwarming and a good laugh. The antics have been upped in this film from the original Ant Man and to great effect, especially with the cars constantly changing size and the chase scene around San Francisco was fun to watch! It balances great comedy, scientific discussions, adventures into the Quantum realm and a heartwarming family story in one film. They played on many of the strengths of the first film and yet what made the movie stronger is the increased ferocity of Lilly's Hope aka The Wasp character, really great to see another strong female superhero in the MCU! I think what was also great is having a diverse cast in terms of race, gender and age! It's true the villain of the ghost is no huge villain, but an interesting character for sure who you can actually sympathise with due to her affliction, plus it's also interesting to see how S.H.I.E.L.D yet again was revealed to be not a very morally ethical institution at all times due to their connection with Ghost (of course it was infiltrated by Hydra anyway!) The immediate post credit scene is very important to watch if you're a Marvel fan and have seen Infinity War but there's no reason to stay until the final end credits scene since it's just silly and doesn't add to the storyline."
704,10,"Great entertainment Is it dumb? Yes. Is it childish? Probably. Is it the best of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe? Absolutely not. But hey, it's no bad at all.I surprisingly enjoyed a lot the first Ant-Man movie when it came out. And, altough I wasn't excited for this one as I was for 'Infinity war', I still was looking forward to see it. And the result was really good. It has as many good laughs as you would expect from a Marvel movie nowadays, as well as great and exciting 3D visuals, nice plot and, of course, a post-credit ending scene that no Marvel fan saw (or will see) coming.So, I'd personally tell you to take it for what it is: pure, mindless fun and entertainment. I don't know if true Marvel fans will like it, but I did. Don't stop to think if it is stupid or not, just enjoy it.Peace!"
705,8,"Really solid movie Just an overal good movie. The story could have been a bit better and the villans were not Thanos-level but it just does the job. I wanted more actually, because the CGI was really good. Also this is one of the funniest mcu movies, so if you want a good laugh I recommend this.I applaud Paul Rudd and Micheal Douglas, great performance!If you're a marvel fan this will satisfy you 100% and even if you just want to relax and enjoy this movie with the family, that's cool too.It's kind off not really tied to the rest of the mcu, just as the first one, only captain America civil war a bit. Make sure u stay for the first post credit scene!"
706,6,"Decent. I went in to Ant-Man and the Wasp expecting a decently put together, good looking, yet somewhat below average movie, I got exactly what I was thinking. While the environments in some areas were amazing and looked great, others disappointed and looked half-decent. The writing was okay, I'd rank it as ""Below-average Marvel movie."" The jokes were predictable and somewhat flat, but it didn't disappoint in the action category, which is really what you expect in a marvel movie. All in all, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't call it a fantastic movie. It was a fun ride with very little substance."
707,10,Paul Rudd Paul Rudd was adorable and so funny without telegraphing it. Michael Peña keeps getting better and better and funnier and funnier. The whole cast was spot on. I have seen it
708,8,"Decent Entertainment This was an enjoyable, entertaining movie, although by no means perfect. There was a good mixture of humor and action. Ghost wasn't what you would call a great villain, but she was adequate, and one could sympathize with her because of her past. Ant man and the wasp were good in their duo super-hero roles.And of course, Stan Lee. How could he have known when he became involved in comic book writing 'way back in 1939, that he would be in limited roles of Marvel movies almost eighty years later, a world he had a main role in creating via comic books back in 1961?"
709,6,"Fun & Fast-Paced, But Not As Good As The Prequel! 2015's 'Ant-Man' was, in my opinion, the best Marvel film at the time of its release. And over the years, with a plethora of superhero films wrestling it out quite frequently, I still chose the story of the tiny superhero as the real deal. So obviously, its sequel is a big event for me as a true fan.So, is 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' as great as its prequel? The answer is - no. BUT, is it a bad film? NOPE. This sequel is actually quite a fun watch, that doesn't take itself too seriously. Its fast-paced & fun, and to be honest, never boring. While it lacks the perfection of the 2015 blockbuster, it still stands on its own, despite its undeniable glitches.'Ant -Man and the Wasp' Synopsis: As Scott Lang balances being both a Super Hero and a father, Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym present an urgent new mission that finds the Ant-Man fighting alongside The Wasp to uncover secrets from their past.The key problem with 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is that it lacks a strong villain. Of course, there is an adversary in the form of Ghost (played superbly by Hannah John-Kamen), but this villain isn't the one that comes across as a troublemaker obsessed with attaining power. Not giving away any spoilers, but Ghost isn't a villain that Ant-Man or the Wasp have to fear their lives for. And that, for any superhero film, is a minus, in my opinion. Its simple: When you have people with superpowers, make sure they use those powers with someone who's equally as powerful or challenging.Keeping aside its baddie problems, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is quite a joyride on every other front. The jokes are on-point, with some LOL moments that leave you in splits. I also liked the fact that this wasn't a story about saving the entire world, in turn, this sequel, just like its prequel, is a personal story about a bunch of people & their conflicts. I found myself laughing at most times & also entertained, although I craved for some kick-ass action.Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers & Paul Rudd's Screenplay plays it cool & offers ample moments of true fun. How I wish they penned a stronger, meaner villain. Peyton Reed's Direction is satisfactory. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design, are perfect. Christophe Beck's Score is great. Graphics are excellent. Action-Sequences are nicely done, although they are in short supply.Performance-Wise: Paul Rudd returns as Scott Lang/Ant-Man & he's delightful all through. Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne/Wasp, is wonderful. Michael Peña as Luis, is super-efficient. Walton Goggins as Sonny Burch, is terrific. Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Laurence Fishburne as Bill Foster & Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, being veterans, are absolutely perfect in their respective parts. Others very lend good support.On the whole, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is definitely fun, but falls short of expectations overall. Nonetheless, its worth a watch!"
710,6,Below my expectation This is not to good but not to bad. Compare the first movie this bad and cant be good
711,4,"You're Not Missing Much Ant Man and the Wasp isn't special as a movie, much less so as a Marvel movie. While it does have some passable visual gags, it is riddled with plotholes and spends the first few minutes dishing out exposition that you could easily pick up if you've seen the first Ant Man and Captain America: Civil War (why would you watch a sequel before the original, anyways). The product placements in this movie are particularly blatant, which is saying something for a Marvel movie.Still, like I said, a few of the visual gags are passable, and the fight choreography is enjoyable, but as a movie that doesn't exactly need to exist in the first place, it's better to be avoided to save some money. You're not missing much."
712,9,"I wish I were half as entertaining as these guys I hear the old movie studio moguls used to believe that it was their stars that counted, that movie-goers would come out to see them regardless of the story. But I have always felt almost the exact opposite, I enjoy seeing a good actor but it mostly the story that got me into the theater. Lately, however, with some of the recent crop of stars, I seem to be enjoying their antics more than ever. So it was here, Paul Ruud has such a light touch, you wonder if he could really be as pleasant a guy as all that. I wouldn't be surprised.All that was needed was for him to be given a good script, some capable supporting actors, as here, and the movie would be a winner. This movie is no masterpiece but it's way above its competition in my opinion. You will be entertained from start to finish, in a tale that makes rough sense, despite its including some reflection about the ultra-small quantum world. The computer work is top notch and time flew for both me and my wife. Highly recommend."
713,1,Blah I actually snoozed a bit during the movie. I haven't done that at the theaters in who knows how long. The only thing that the leads did during any chase or action sequence was to shrink to get away or grow big to fight someone. There was nothing innovative about the script. Pretty lame for a marvel movie. The comments that were aimed at being funny landed flat or were plain annoying. And the ending was actually laughable (not in a good way).
714,7,"Oh Marvel...... Like every Marvel movie, I left realizing Marvel had completed exactly what it had wanted to do for this movie, and every movie they create in fact.Marvel has processed a new sequel of which checks all of the boxes Marvel requires for each of their movie. Is it a movie forcefully pumped full of laughable moments? What about being a movie splattered in extremely forgetful action scenes, check. And most importantly, is it a movie in which no external thought is required after leaving the movie.Sometimes Marvel will derive from these check boxes, and in such cases, the movies will slightly increase in quality, this is apparent especially in Infinity War in which viewers will leave the theater walking away actually engaged in a very good way. For the Ant-Man and the Wasp, Marvel has a heyday with the growth and shrinking idea. It's gotta get old right? surprisingly nope, I enjoyed and was actually engaged in the fighting, leaving not memorable stories or characters, but fun fighting scenes.Rather than becoming a beautiful piece of art hanging upon a museum, Marvel has chosen to take the easy way out and made one of those crappy inspirational posters at a doctor office. Sure it works, but come on..."
715,10,All hail Ant-Man and the wasp Okay so I walked into the theater expecting a fun time no doubt but this was wayyyy more than I could ever have asked for It made me laugh so hard and I felt rushes of action threw out the movie I had such. A good time here it was one of the best things this year if not the best I totally recommend it to anyone unless you have sensitive kids the wasp is a good role model for young girls she's actually a badass and not a sissie the movie made me smile on several ocaoccasions.
716,10,Surprisingly pleased. I haven't seen the first and thought I would think it was corny. I loved it. Funny and interesting. I'll definitely see the first.
717,7,"A Nice Contrast to the Devastating Epic that is Avengers: Infinity War How do you follow up the shocking gut-punch that is Avengers: Infinity War? With a lighthearted, standalone comedy like Ant-Man and the Wasp, naturally. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) has always been an interesting character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is one of the more absurd heroes, and yet Marvel found a way to make him appealing back in 2015. Paul Rudd is excellent as the character, and he brings something to the universe that nobody else really does. Ant-Man was a good film, and I liked it very much. I don't think it's one of Marvel's best, but it's a solid movie that I definitely enjoyed. So I've been looking forward to the sequel. With Evangeline Lily now suited up right alongside Rudd as the Wasp, I thought that this one had the potential to exceed the first film. I have to see Ant-Man again, but I do think I still like that one more than this new one. Ant-Man and the Wasp has a lot of great comedy and is immensely entertaining, though its storytelling is rather simplistic and can even come across as cheesy and cliched at times. But while the writing isn't the strongest, it's the characters and the dynamic between Rudd and Lily that really make this film succeed..."
718,10,"Awesome!! The movie is amazing,the action scenes are fantastic and creative. The visual effects are perfect. Evangeline Lilly steals the show,The Wasp is incredible,charismatic,badass and charming."
719,7,"Better then the first So basically when I went and saw the first Antman movie 3 years ago which now feels like it was a year ago, I hated it. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy i just didn't find it funny. I felt that it was a bit to depressing in some areas though far less then the first guardians of the galaxy, and I just didn't find it that funny.And like guardians of the galaxy vol.2 I found this one as well a improvement over the first Ant-man movie, though it wasn't as big as an improvement compared to Guardians of the galaxy vol.2. For one for once i actually laughed watching this film unlike the first Ant-man movie. Such as the scenes where Ant-man does the card tricks to the FBI agent and then later in the movie we see him trying to learn the card trick that left me laughing. And so did a couple over jokes in the movie.As for the characters. Let me give you the short one on that:Ant-man: Basically threw out the movie he sucks not as being a character or being a superhero but because everything around him screws up.Wasp: I thought she was better in the first one. I hated her and she was once of the things I hated the most from the first movie. At least they got rid of that stupid haircut she had in the first movie. Hell even Luis points that out.Luis: He was hilarious he was my favorite thing from the first movie and thats saying a lot especially when you take into account my feelings for the first movie.Hank Pym: Hes a jerk throwout most of the movie, lad the movie brought of much of a jerk he can be at times.Ghost: Well Marvels been throwing out a bunch of new villains this year from Killmonger to Thanos and all of them are sympathetic. This one is sympathetic too, she has a really sad past. But just like Captain Marvel if she's been around for years being evil. Where the hell has she been all these years.And then theres the end credit scene the best part in the movie for me. Oh my god it was so shocking.In the end while this film isn't perfect, i do have to say that compared to the first movie this film is a big improvement over the first film. And for that i give this movie 7 out of 10. But because Hank is a jerk throwout most of it and Michelle Pfeiffer only gets around less then 10 minutes of screen time and you all know what happens to her at the end of the movie."
720,4,"Weak second installment in the MCU - part 5. Unlike in most of the franchises where the third installment is the weakest, MCU happens to be consistent in making the second installment the weakest one, except for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"" is a continuation in the legacy. It was mostly vague, and almost a total crap. It doesn't try to be anything more than a filler. To be honest, it felt like a dumbed down version of ""25th Hour"" with a lighter tone featuring some superhero characters. It simply aims at being a movie with some little fun stuff but being disposable on the whole. Both of the major plotlines - one involving Ghost and the other involving Sonny Burch felt just like something that was there to help the plot go further. The characterization of Ghost and Burch have no depth in them. Burch is totally shallow and one dimensional and generic. Ghost has a little backstory, and isn't enough to get behind the character. The motives which drive both the plotlines are totally clichéd and thinly built. It felt as if they thought 'Ghost isn't a good villain, let's distract the viewers by giving them the other plotline'. This created an ""Iron Man 2"" level of multiple plotline mess - a little less interesting. Ant-Man is a sidekick in this movie. From someone who could bring about a well planned heist to a doofus - with no explanation. Giant Man plays into the story, but it's more for slapsticky purposes. Also, the original Wasp gets some powers in the Quantum Realm which are not even explained by this movie. Surely, it might be explained in future films, but it could've easily done that. Lawrence Fishburne feels like a wasted talent in this movie. It seemed like a promising character, but turned out to be the same old ""good guy in the bad guy's side"" character. One good thing about this movie, besides the cast, is the deaging CGI. It looked awesome. To me, it felt like Michael Douglas from the 90s with just a different hair and almost similarly with others. Father-daughter dynamic between Scott and his daughter was likeable. To sum it up, I must say that it was way below my expectations. It's not that I have watched an impactful and emotionally craving ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and I wasn't in a mood to watch something so less impactful. I knew it wasn't going to be a spectacular as IW but neither did I expect it to be so much of a mediocrity. It's not that the aftermath of IW has holded this movie down. After a long time, it will develop the same legacy as that of ""Iron Man 2"", at best. I wonder how the same critics who panned ""Justice League"" (2017) for having a thin plot and creating a mess gave it a thumbs up. As someone who likes ""Ant-Man"" (2015) and considers it to be the most underappreciated MCU movie till date, its sequel was mediocre at best. I thought ""Black Panther"" was going to be the worst MCU movie of 2018, but I was wrong. It's ""Ant-Man and The Wasp"".Score : 4.1/10Grade : D+Label : Disappointing"
721,7,"Fun Summer Movie Ant-Man and Wasp was a fun movie. Whereas I didn't see it strongly bolstering the MCU, it didn't harm the MCU at all. I like that they gave Ant-Man a partner (I dare not say sidekick) with similar, yet better abilities.Now, as for what I wish would've been different/better: the nemesis, Ghost. Ghost has some excellent skills and abilities which I think they (the production team) could've/should've explored more. I mean, the ability to phase in and out almost at will thereby giving the person the ability to pass through solid matter (kinda like Kitty Pride of the X-Men)--that makes for some spectacular fight scenes and other mischief. I'm imagining a fight similar to the opening scene of X-Men 2 when Nightcrawler infiltrated the White House. I know that phasing in and out is different than teleporting but in tight quarters they can be used similarly.That was my only gripe, which was a small one. Besides wanting more from the bad guy I thought the movie was funny and creative."
722,7,"Small When is small too small? You will soon discover as the Antman ventures into the quantum realm to bring back Dr. Hank Pam's wife. Teamed up with the Wasp, Ant-man fights time and the evil forces to dive into the unknown. A sludge of new evil characters create obstacles to succeed in what seems as an I possible mission. Dr Wilson Triviño"
723,5,"Was Ant-Man and the Wasp any good? Eh, I guess...? I found 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to be a competent, albeit underwhelming experience, especially when bringing into account the MCU film preceding it is undoubtedly one of the biggest films of all time. Paul Rudd remains to be a charismatic and likable down-to-earth lead from previous films. However, wherein his performance is strong, I found the material he was given from the script to be derogatory to the character, as he was portrayed here as a bumbling goofball who is incompetent in battle, which is clearly done just to make Evangeline Lilly's Wasp appear a much stronger character. I did enjoy watching Wasp in action, as she did have the better-choreographed scenes, and Lilly looked like she was having an absolute ball in this role, but I cannot help but feel her role felt like an attempt of a feminist statement saying ""women can be superheroes too"". I fully agree with that statement, but it should not be portrayed at the expense of making the male lead a laughable idiot. The comedy was pretty hit or miss too. There were many visual gags that got a laugh out of me, but then there were more dialogue reliant gags, such as Lang's phone going off, was just embarrassing to watch. The comedy, and furthermore, the story itself, just did not feel as sharp and fast-paced as the first film. And despite my bias aside, I do believe this was because Edgar Wright had no involvement whatsoever, whereas Peyton Reed seems to be more experienced in traditional by-the-numbers rom coms. The villains were also pretty lackluster, which is disappointing considering the recent winning streak Marvel has been having with its villains onscreen. Ghost, despite her great design, does not feel threatening or relatable whatsoever, and Walton Goggin's Sonny is just a businessman, whose involvement is based on business reasons. Other actors, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Laurence Fishburne, felt pretty pointless as well. At least Fishburne looked to be enjoying himself more here than the DC Movies. Overall, ignoring my blatant criticisms, I still enjoyed this film despite how heavily flawed it was. It's a standard popcorn movie, and if I was to go anything other than pure entertainment, which I was fulfilled with, then of course I would be building myself up for disappointment."
724,8,"Marvel's fun run resumes After a dark and intense Infinity War, Marvel's back to its fun groove. What better superhero than Ant-Man to choose for bringing back the vibes. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a typical Marvel entertainer with a slightly different feel to it because of the post infinity war.Just like how the Ironman franchise evolved technically, Ant-Man also comes up with advanced features for the suit and technology. The size shifting action sequences are a treat to watch. It almost brings you your childhood memories of playing with toy cars. The movie is does live up to his humour quotient which is somewhat similar to the first part. Make sure not to miss the first post credit scene!There is not much to say about the acting especially with respect to the veteran actors for whose these roles are pretty basic stuff. Michael Pena once again stands out with his comic timing. British actress Hannah John Kamen as Ava is impressive. Randall Park is another addition to the funny cop brigade as Bobby Cannavale takes slightly backseat on this one.Ant-Man and the Wasp is a summer fun family outing. More so, if your family is a Marvel fan family ;-)"
725,10,"FINALLY Wasp in action and kicking butt! Exciting, funny and fun, there are lots of bad guys and lots of action in FINALLY a Wasp movie! In the comics Wasp not only founded the Avengers BUT NAMED them, so it was great to see her in action and kicking butt!!! I can't wait for Ant-Man 3 which I'm fairly confident is going to be- 'Giant Girl' and star the scene stealing- Abby Ryder Fortson as Cassie, AKA, #GiantGirl"
726,2,"No reason for this movie Congrats, Thor: The Dark World. You're no longer the worst movie in the MCU. There was no point to this movie. There were some funny moments and good performances by the actors, but not enough to make up for the lack of plot. The first post-credit scene was the best part of the movie."
727,3,"Why can't it just be ""The Wasp?"" Yes, yes, I'm biased because I've met Evangeline Lilly several times, and she is just as adorbs in person as she is in this movie. But I know that other viewers sensed it as well-- the movie would have been so much better if they had just expanded her character's role and maybe even eliminated Ant-Man's presence. I'm sorry, but Paul Rudd bores the hell out of me. I've delayed watching this film just because I knew that it was going to be as tedious as it seemed. Even Stan Lee seemed like he didn't even want to make his cameo. It was a laborious, tedious thing to build up to the next ""Avengers"" movie-- and let's face it, Infinity War wouldn't have been nearly as great if Ant-Man was in it. And I know that I wasn't the only person who groaned at the end of this film when the feds tell Ant-Man that he isn't under house arrest anymore-- we knew that we're guaranteed to see him finish out the Infinity War saga. Again, please just have him fall down a manhole cover, and let The Wasp go solo. I don't care about this character."
728,8,"It's better than bad, good. I don't understand why so many people are rating this so low. It was solid. Fun, great pacing, great effects, good story, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It didn't have the seriousness of Infinity War, but this film didn't need it. It is supposed to be a lighter, more fun, less serious adventure film and it hits all those notes nearly perfectly."
729,8,"More grounded, more hilarious I was a bit worried about this film on what more they could deliver. While some of the same returned, some very different ideas were added to make for some hilarious scenes. The Wasp really got the spotlight in this movie, and delivered more development of her character and the relationship between her family. The plot was a bit lackluster, but it was nice to get a more grounded film in the MCU again after Infinity War."
730,9,"An awesome depiction of a sizing machine A long time ago, during a defusing operation, a now famous professor loses his beloved into the Quantum. Nowadays, hoping that she is still alive, the professor and his daughter build a machine which can get them where they supposedly can rescue her. Scott, a former agent now caring father is brought once again in order to help the cause, while another two parties seem to be interested in their experiment.Although seeming pretty basic in terms of plot, this movie offers more substance than thought at first glance. The whole miniature device is pretty amazing, granting the owners some very impressive powers, thus contributing decisively to the outcome of the events. Bring into the equation a couple of great actors with some good roles of their own and you get an interesting movie, from start to end.Speaking of the characters, although well developed and described, especially when unknown facts are brought back to life, are not very likeable. They seem to be a bit easy to hate so you might fall into this trap and not feel anything for them, case which isn't quite likeable. Fortunately, I didn't, so they were ok for me, but I also couldn't attach myself completely to their cause, which would have made the story truly immersive.Nevertheless, its action, set on a conflict which involves three distinct parties, won't let you get bored. On the contrary, it generates plenty of thrill and suspense, keeping the viewer glued to the screen. Add into the equation some impressive CGI and you end up with a great atmosphere for the events to take place.I have to say that I enjoyed this one overall. It delivered what it was meant to deliver, which is plenty of action, suspense and CGI, a good and quite unpredictable story, some good actors and even some good characters, again, if you don't get to hate them from the beginning. It kept me interested, entertained and even amazed at times, thus from my point of view, it reached its goal. A very good movie!"
731,7,Fun This isn't Earth shaking but its leads are funny and charismatic and the effects are good. It's a pleasant way to pass the time.
732,7,"Quantum Wedged In between the movie Scott Lang says that they are using ""Quantum"" in front of any thing they are speaking. Ironically, the movie plays with a plot that is twisted with Quantum Physics concepts with extreme and maleficent cinematic liberties and plays true to his words.The plot is a standard story line used in Marvel movies and certain scenes follow the tone of Fast and the Furious franchise. Even the physics bending the laws seems to play like certain unbelievable scenes of Fast and the Furious. The story is brought down to the well-known climax of bringing back the original Wasp - Janet from the quantum realm.The story has a black market dealer who wants to steal the quantum tunnel built by Hank Pym, the people hurt by Hank Pym's ego during his S.H.I.E.L.D days and breaking the Sokovia Accords in Civil War render Ant-Man Scott Lang under house arrest. How can Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne who are hiding from the FBI as they were responsible for the Ant-Man suit and they too are implicated in the breaking of the Sokovia Accords open the tunnel to the quantum realm and bring Janet out? To add fuel to this plot we have Ghost who needs the tunnel to cure herself and is supported by an ex colleague of Hank's. Ant-Man and the Wasp has taken the cine-making liberty too far and broken many a barriers of logic.The story and the plot though very predictable is cleverly screen-played with quantum proportions of building tension with scenes such as malfunctioning suits, birds pecking on ants in the climax, house arrest and the ""slow"" FBI, shrinking tech. The story is a simple filler to the Ant-Man franchise. Marvel seems to be adding more characters into Avengers multiverse and is also winning in building franchise out of all their characters.Overall we do not get much clear answers to the just concluded Infinity War but before we can claim that Quantum Reality will be used to undo the snap we have to find out how Scott Lang came out of the quantum reality and how is he going to as Hank Pym, Janet and Hope have disintegrated? The makers have once again created curious questions.The only question Ant-Man and the Wasp answers is What the hell was Ant-Man doing instead of fighting Thanos alongside the Avengers in Wakanda or in Titan?Screenplay - 3/5 Visuals - 3/5 Acting - 4/5 Plot - 2/5Should you watch it? A definite yes!"
733,10,Loved it! The movie is quite entertaining and funny but it's worth a wait.
734,1,"How can this movie even get a 7.6 stars rating FFS First of all the script is awfully written about smushy lovestory. Then unnecessary and lack of foundation for the villains like they're just squeez them in to meet the duration. Apparently no logic nor laws of physics were applied in this movie as as a building weight thousands of ton can be carried as a suitcase, The Wasp can fly faster and race car, they literally only have 2h to save the mother but she decided to have a race with the bad guys instead of just shrink and hide or fly always, electric and water don't seem to be a problem for them so they just move to wherever they want, the list go on you name it. And i think we can all agree that their puns need more salt, like a bunch of it."
735,6,"It's kind of okay but lacks charm The first ant man movie is in my top 5 MCU list. This one didn't make any sense on the other hand. It neither contributes to the larger MCU storyline nor does it stand out as a good stand alone film. There is no antagonist in movie or any deeper layers to compensate for it. The first half was crisp, funny, and had a lot many cool moments to surprise you only if skimmed the trailers. The second half was just stretched and had no binding momentum. You can still give it a watch as a one time outing, but don't expect much."
736,7,"Better than the first Let's face it... most people only saw Ant-Man and the Wasp because they wanted a it to be connected to infinity war. The first Ant-Man never lived up to marvels standards for most fans. But the second was much more enjoyable than the first... mostly because we got what we wanted... The connection. But just looking at the movie alone it was definitely a well made, bold, action-packed movie. Definitely makes me respect Ant-Mans place in upcoming marvel films. I am also looking forward to seeing the Wasp back in action? All-in-all this movie is definitely marvel worthy. I can't wait for avengers 4. It truly is the year of marvel."
737,8,"Chinti Manus and Hadda baai In the Marvel Comic Universe the superheroes lose their temper, doubt themselves, are funny, moody and sometimes 'in your face'. That's exactly how the human race is. I like how Marvel universe has always portrayed its characters to be more than do-gooders. They have given into temptation, they've had difference of opinions and yet at the end of the day they get back together. I have found adulthood to be exactly that. As adults we have our own opinions and we don't have to agree with each other but that doesn't mean we still can't be friends and civil with each other. MCU gives adults a fair share of life lessons while the kids enjoy the CGI and stunts. Every time I watch an MCU movie I go home feeling satisfied because then I am not questioning myself and wondering if I am really a nice person.Yesterday I watched Ant Man and The Wasp with my friends. We loved it! In 2015 we were left with Captain America and Falcon talking with Falcon telling Cap that he ""knows someone"". If you have watched Captain America: Civil War, you'll know that Lang is under house arrest. The movie begins with Lang having just 3 more days before his sentence is up. Lang in the past two years has gotten closer to his daughter and is learning magic to entertain her. During one of the father-daughter in-house adventures Lang's foot pushes through the picket fence thereby setting off the alarm on his ankle monitor. In no time the Feds arrive to check his home and we are introduced to Agent Woo who has his suspicions about Scott. Parallelly Hope and Hank are working on the possibility that Janet is still alive except they need to figure out a way to reach her. When they do, it is Scott who wakes up from a strange dream and that little dream sets the story in motion. This is where S.H.I.E.L.D agents come in. Two of the S.H.I.E.L.D agents who worked with Hank previously come back in different manner, one to haunt Hank and Hope's progress in building a tunnel to reach the quantum realm and the other as a voice of reason. It is this bit that reinforces my faith in the MCU - we are the sum of all the experiences we have had.In order to build the tunnel, the Pyms need certain parts for their tunnel and turn to Sonny Burch who is their doorway to black marketed materials except he's caught on to the fact that the Pyms are on to something bigger and wanting to dip his finger in the pie, offers Hope 1B$ for whatever it is that they are working on which of course ensues in some action and Wasp's entry!This time around the movie has upped its quality in terms of action sequences and I love how they have utilized the characters to their full potential. There isn't a moment of, ""Why aren't you using your powers now!""Cassie is a little older. She's known her dad was the Ant-man and in this movie also appears as a kid who is mature for her age and is also the force that urges him to help the Pyms.S.H.I.E.L.D, Pyms, Black marketers, FBI agents, the 3 Wombats and ANTS all make this movie fantastic. Also may I just say I love, love, love, Luis sequences in the movie and they are funnier this time around especially when he is having an argument with Divian Ladwa. (Don't know who he is? Haven't you watched LION after reading our review on it? Tsk tsk.)The story is about a rescue mission where it isn't just about bringing back someone who's been gone for 30 years but also about what that kind of time in the quantum realm could do to a person. I wish I could say all ends well but the fact is that I don't know!I had theories after watching infinity war and now I am a little lost but I know if I re watch all the movies from the past 3 years I will accumulate more clues and will have my theory in place by November. Talking about November, the Venom posters are already up!I love how MCU movies end, with an emphasis on '.' and '?'. MCU is basically encouraging little kids to understand punctuation better."
738,6,"Huge scale but movie is watchable only because of mid credits. Scott is now itering with his fatherly duties, escaping the FBI and on his new superhero duties. Though the shrinking ability of the protagonists is the film's USP, what lies at the heart of this film is the father-son bond between Casey-Scott and Hank-Hope.Michael Pena does a great job. The monologues are stunning.But antman and the wasp fails to bring out the essence which could have been a driving factor. But while Black Panther's largely independent story worked in its favour, Ant-Man and the Wasp feels too slight to function on its own. Honestly, the entire plot of the film could have been done and dusted in a five-minute digression in Avengers: Infinity War.Ant-Man and the Wasp feels like a feature-length introduction to the quantum realm. Rather than focusing on the Story line the inter-relationship between the characters, Pym's scientific usage of terminology is a bit unnecessary.The scale was good but the movie lacked the connection. The mid credits and end credits were the highlights of the movie. To summarize the whole movie it was like Watching 2 hours of a flick depending entirely upon the mid credits scene."
739,10,Good work by Marvel This Ant-Man movie is better than previous Ant-Man movie. It has great action with good caste
740,3,"It's a filler marvel movie There are some funny jokes, I guess, but the plot is basic and there is no style or substance to the directing or action scenes. Also all the characters are very one-note and don't have any arcs or any personality. Everything about this movie is bland. 3/10."
741,4,"Ends the Streak of Great MCU Films Marvel is coming off quite possibly their best streak of 3 films including Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther, and Infinity War; Ant-Man & the Wasp found itself in a unique situation. Some people thought all it had to do was be fun and present a different tone than what Infinity War did a few months back, others thought it had even more pressure to continue the streak of greatness. For me, I just wanted a good movie that would make me laugh. Because for the most part, that's what the first Ant-Man did.Sadly, the sequel barely does anything to separate itself from other superhero films or really make a mark in a crowded field of movies. Let's begin with the humor (which is getting a lot of credit for some reason). There are a few characters in this film that are anything but actual humans. They are caricatures that are only there to spout jokes for ever second they are on screen. Randall Park and Michael Pena no longer feel like real people. Walton Goggins (albeit not there for humor) is a completely useless character that is solely there so that the secondary characters can have a brief action ""chase"" sequence. You never get a true sense of his purpose or motivations. He's just there.The villain, Ghost, (played by Hannah John-Kamen) looked like an interesting addition in the trailers and has the ability to phase through anything. Her goal in this movie directly relates to a spoiler-ish mission that Ant-Man & the Wasp go on, but there was never once that she had an imposing presence on screen. In fact, there isn't a single character that even feels like an antagonist or a conflict, which is a good reason for why this movie fails.Evangeline Lilly is incredible in this movie and is a complete 180 from her role in the first film. She actually gets a chance to do something and every second she's on screen is electric. Unfortunately, a lot of that comes at the expense of Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. He's no longer a nifty bada**, but rather a clumsy guy in a suit that's good for a few punches and one too many jokes.As a whole, the film is easily the worst and most pointless entry into the MCU. There's no reason this film should get more praise simply because its a lighter movie that comes right after Infinity War. Years from now I think people are going to realize that there is just a lack of substance here.4.0/10"
742,8,"Afterall it's Marvel The story of the film begins where Captain America completes the Civil War, where Scott is an ant-man that has been kept in internment for two years in his own home. That's why we haven't found Ant-Man in Avengers- Infinity war. There is also talk about it in infinity war movie that The ""Hawk Eye"" & ""Ant-Man"" are in internment.Hope and Pym are scared to the Scott, because he has stolen the Pym's suit for Captain America to fight against the Avengers in civil war.The main story of the movie is that Hope's mother is trapped in Quantum Field and they are trying to bring her out form it.Ant man is helping for it.A new marvel character EVA introduced in this movie EVA was suffering from quantum phasing & for relief from it she also wants power from quantum tunnel made by Hank Pym for rescue of his Wife & Hope's Mother who was originally WASP. Now what will happen in this movie you have to see that.Movie's story is emotional,dramatic & comedy also.You will find some extra ordinary humor also. The connection between marvel's movies are excellent, all the movies are in co relation with each other. Civil war was released in 2016 & this movie is released in 2018 that is the real period of internment of Ant-Man that is perfect so hats off to marvel studio. Direction of the movie is excellent some shots are taken far better than first part.One thing is eye catching of this movie is it's CGI & VFX. Take a bow to its effect which are used in this film for making object's Very small to very Big in size in few seconds. 3D effect is also good but it's OK if you will not found in 3D, you will not loose much to watch in 2D. Main part of the movie is Evangeline Lilly (Wasp). Excellent performance given by her in the role of wasp & better than first part. Don't forget Michael Douglas for his performance as always. Ant-Man & WASP will be seen in next avengers' movie also.The connection between Avengers & this movie is perfect & you will find this in end credit scene.Finally it is the marvel flick & If you are a Marvel fan don't miss it. & If you are an English movie fan it is OK for you.For CGI & VFX artist it's a treat to watch."
743,8,"Whether ant-sized or a giant, Ant-Man and the Wasp continues it's fun adventure tone, even if it doesn't have much of a point When it comes to movies about shrinking, I've rarely found a good one. It's not a bad idea, to see something from another size perspective. Not to mention, it provides some great possibility for everything trying to kill the subject shrunken. In fact movies like The Incredible Shrinking Man and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, both were able to convoy the thrill of everyday life suddenly becoming giant monsters, even flies and...ants per say? I think the problem is whenever shrinking is done on film, directors always seem to only show that thrill and not explore the scientific possibilities...that it until Ant-Man was made in 2015.I knew almost nothing of the Marvel hero other then he was popular within the comic culture and the movie spent a while in development hell with originally Edgar Wright in the director's chair. Thankfully, Ant-Man proved to not only be different (unlike Iron Man and Captain America who simply want everyone to be safe, Ant-Man seems to be doing this for his family), but was more comedic in tone compared to the other MCU movies. While shrunken, they also took the time to consider where shrinking could go (like atomic size). Let's see how things are built upon in Ant-Man and the Wasp.After the events of Captain America: Civil War, Ant-Man/Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd) has been placed under house arrest along with his ties cut to Hank Pym (played by Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope Van Dyne (Played by Evangeline Lilly). Just before his house arrest is set to end, Scott receives some odd message from the Quantum Realm who he believes to be Hank's long lost wife Janet (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). He calls Hank to tell him. This leads Hope to kidnap Scott and take him to Hank's new lab who is looking to open a portal to the Quantum Realm with hopes to rescue Janet.Hope arranges to acquire one more part from an arms dealer, but a double cross nearly stops her. She manages to fight him and his men as the Wasp, who has the same shrinking capabilities, but also as wings and laser blasters. Just as she defeats them, she is also attacked by a masked woman who has ""ghost"" abilities. This Ghost is Ava Starr (Played by Hannah John-Kamen) who manages to steal Hank's lab (don't ask how, the result is hilarious). The fight is on to see if they can enter the Quantum Realm once more and make sure Ant-Man doesn't officially violate his house arrest (which is also funny). I'm happy to say that Ant-Man and the Wasp is just as fun as the previous movie is. Does it pave the way for new storytelling like Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War? No, but it really doesn't appear to be the case for this movie. In fact, given the grim nature of the previous Avengers movie, Ant-Man and the Wasp is more like a relaxing adventure to enjoy. I can't say this story has a lot of purpose, but again, it's just an enjoyable action movie that can still go with the first movie.I'll start by saying that the story does offer something fun; that of a simple goal, which is to get to the Quantum Realm. After we got a brief glimpse of it in the previous movie, it's nice to see that several characters are trying to get to it. So that leads into another great thing; in which there really isn't a villain in this movie. Yes, there is a super human trying to get in their way and a mafia as well, but neither are trying to ""defeat"" anyone. They all just happen to want the same thing. In a way, this makes this a giant race. The tone still remains more comedic. There are not only jokes from Paul Rudd, Michael Douglass, and even Michael Peña in a returning role, but the ability to shrink and enlarge does come with a lot of visual gags. If you thought the giant Thomas the Tank Engine from before was funny, get ready to see that they do here. We have pez dispensers, salt shakers and giant roller briefcases.I'll give this four Wasp's out of five. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed this as much as the first. No more, no less. The Ant-Man series, at least in my book, has the most rewatch value within the MCU. They stand on their own better then a lot of others (even though I really enjoy these movies). Go see it and marvel at it's abilities.Note: Yes, they address the events from Avengers: Infinity War...but I won't say how, so be sure to stay through the end credits to see what happens"
744,10,"This movie redeemed the name of Antman!! I really enjoyed this movie and found it alot better than the original first Antman movie because I feel that the first Antman movie had no connections with the MCU, But with Antman and the wasp I guarantee you'll feel differently and may even start taking Antman alot more seriously than you do now"
745,7,"good things come in small packages You have to hand it to Marvel- if not for anything, just for trying to be different. Just in 2018 they got us a Shakespearean saga in Black Panther, and a universe shattering epic in Infinity Wars. Marvel now brings us a love story in Ant Man and the Wasp. Love story it is, as it deals with an octogenarian trying to find his lost love, and it does help that they said characters are being played by two of the most charismatic stars of the 80s- Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer. Just to think that this is the first time these guys share screen space itself gives goosebumps, joyride of a film notwithstanding.Ant Man and the Wasp picks up from the airport battle royale in Captain America: Civil War. As part of the punishment in violating the Sokovia Accords, Scott Lang is serving out a house arrest, while Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne have been reduced to being fugitives. However, Scott's feat of coming back from the quantum zone has given Hank the confidence that maybe his wife Janet is alive too. Since this is a family fun movie, the rest of the script focuses on getting the family back together.Scott Lang: Hold on, you gave her wings? Dr. Hank Pym: And Blasters. Scott Lang: So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me? Dr. Hank Pym: No, I did.Family back together- mostly so. There are villains- Hannah John Kamen's Ghost, and Walton Goggins's Sonny Burch, but they are inconsequential. The first one is a villain because of a conflict of interest- nothing that can get sorted out when they come together and talk and the other is just a thug who wants to sell Pym tech to the highest bidder. Speaking of which, Pym tech once again is the star of the show. The ability to blow up or miniaturize is highlighted in creative action set pieces- both for impact and for the laughs. There is a quantum overdose- after a point an exasperated Scott does ask the scientist father-daughter duo whether they add quantum to anything that they speak.The film's greatest strength though is its star cast. Douglas and Pfeiffer turn back time as effortlessly as ever. Evangeline Lily as the Wasp absolutely owns the action sequences, and she being better in everything is a something that Scott readily accepts- which is great as Paul Rudd specializes in this sort of a romantic loser role. Michael Pena stands out for providing comic relief, and that says a lot, given this is a comedy movie, while Abby Ryder Fortson melts hearts, like at the snap of Thanos's fingers.True, the film is not as emotionally invested and connected as some of Marvel's recent films, and there is too little of Michelle Pfeiffer...but at the same time, like the first Antman movie, the film rejoices in its own intimate world. Plus it has a giant at playing drums! Now who would not want to see THAT????That good things come in small packages- is in a shell Ant Man and the Wasp for you."
746,8,"Really enjoyed this. Not sure what the nay sayers were expecting. Enjoyable movie. It just didnt have a need to be a large part of the Infinity War stuff. It was nice to have a relaxing, stand on its own movie that was just about entertainment"
747,1,"Waste of time, worst ever marvel movie If marvel made ant man miss latest avengers for this crap, then they really need to focus on one movie at a time. No grip over script, unnecessary science and boring dialogues. We were really thinking of leaving the hall midway through movie, but finished in hope that end might be saviour, but no. Utter disappointment!"
748,10,"Light hearted Fun. I think this is a movie a lot of us needed after the events of Infinity war. Light hearted and funny. I love that the ""antagonist,"" was not so much a villain as someone just trying to survive."
749,5,"Lacking the Marvel Spark An avid SciFi fan there is hardly a movie I don't watch especially if it's a Marvel or DC product.However the bar now has been set so high in terms of Graphics, Characters, storylines and even humor which is a relatively late edition to the Science Fiction genre that anything that doesn't challenge your imagination fails to impress.From the humor to the story to the effects Antman and the Wasp was mediocre at best and lackluster at worst.If there wasn't the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas the film would not even have enlisted a review.Paul Rudd made a fairly humorous lead but something about his timing was off making the jokes funny enough for a smile and sometimes even a smirk but never comedic enough for a laugh.Total waste of time. If you are bored go watch Jackpot. At least it will encourage Pakistani Cinema?"
750,5,"Wasp and the Ant-man One thing I like about the Ant-man movies is that the conflict is always small scale, no pun intended there. What I mean is that there is no world ending threat, there are no flying cities or a CGI army so it's all very personal and grounded.Ant-man and the wasp has a lot more of Wasp than Ant-man. Hope van dyne I thought was more central in this movie than Ant-man which I don't have a problem with since he was already well established before but it sometimes felt as if Ant-man didn't get much to do. Evangeline Lilly is amazing and I would love to see a lot more of her in the MCU.Walton goggins plays Sonny burch and he served the same sort of purpose that the golden people did in Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 and that was just to be a minor obstacle so that there are more things happening and the fights can last longer. Another gripe of mine was that the movie doesn't really do anything new and it feels like every other standard marvel blockbuster. Of course it's entertaining and funny but problems like bad exposition and jokes placed at the wrong moments plague this movie just like they do most marvel movies.Ghost was an excellent villain in my opinion thanks to a great performance by Hannah john kamen. Ghost has become one of my favorite marvel villains because she had understandable motives and an intimidating presence.The returning cast is superb as always and the newcomers Lawrence fishburne and Michelle Pfeiffer were excellent in their respective roles. Micheal Pena was once again hilarious and Randall park was a welcome addition to the supporting cast. Another thing I should mention is that the fight scenes were very well directed and a lot of fun.Overall Ant-man and the Wasp is a worthy sequel that is hilarious and exciting and I had a great time watching it. It may not bring anything new to the table but it's still a decent film."
751,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Review Ant Man and the Wasp is a film directed by Peyton Reed. Every MCU film excites me and I look forward to the films. Since I loved the first film, I would say that I expected a lot from this film. Surprisingly, the film does deliver.Plot: Scott Lang teams up with Hank and Hope to retrieve Janet van Dyne from the quantum realm.Story and direction: This film actually relies much on humor to carry forward the story (if that's what it is called). It does a good work of working on the Scott-Cassie bond. This film further strengthens their bond. Also something good here is the de-aging procedure.the actors actually looked very young. The VFX and action scenes of the film were also good. For a film that had a tight budget (atleast smaller than what its contemporaries were investing), it never felt artificial. And the 3D was an added gem to the film that enhanced the beauty of the film. But the film doesn't go without complaints. As with the first film, this film doesn't do justice to the villains. With the MCU having some good villains in its recent ventures, the villains here feel very disposable. They have no reason to exist. Sonny Burch felt more like a joker than a villain. As for Ghost, I wouldn't call her a villain. But still her character could have been developed. Many people have been complaining of Hope van Dyne's storyline. But I did feel fine with it.Performances: Paul Rudd is great as Ant-Man. He perfectly embodies the character. Evangeline Lily was good as the Wasp. As usual, Michael Pena was great. He shined through his so called monologue. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer delivered some compelling performances. As I mentioned before, Walton Goggins was very much disposable. Hannah John Kamen did a good job but would have liked to see more of her. It is always a treat to watch Laurence Fishburne. The other supporting characters do a good job in moving the film forward.Favorite Scene: Scott and Cssie have a little talk where Scott says that his family is paying the price for whatever he is doing. But Cassie then cheers him up by saying that he is doing the right thing. This scene just showed how important a driving force is Cassie in Scott's life.Verdict: After a film that is grand like Infinity War, this film does feel short scaled. But removing that and certain flaws that this film had, I would say that I was surely entertained. I can't wait to see what else this character and this universe has more to offer us. The mid-credits scene is very important to the future films, but I thought the post-credit one felt unimportant.I am going with a 7.5/10."
752,5,"Aunt Man And The W.A.S.P. None of you under the age of 30 will get the headline reference. but in this PC culture why not get real MAD magazine crazy. This movie really wants you to like them. Like a cute puppy it stands on its hindlegs and prances. And it's sweet. And cuddly. How can you possibly hate it? Borderline sitcom style, the story is about...well, it's a slice of a guy's life blown up into 2 hours. Much like the crawl in ""Star Wars"" (1977) becoming the movie to ""Rogue One"" This is about Paul Rudd living out his final days of house arrest before he can do real Dad things with his daughter. Meanwhile, Michael Douglas and Evangeline can save their mom lost in some quantam void. I haven't seen ""Avengers: The Last One"" (not a real title, I just haven't seen the last one) but it seems it draws a little bit from what happened. Something about a stolen suit. Blah blah blah. Or something. I don't even know, the point is Evangeline's mom was lost 30 years ago and they have to recover her so they build this tunnel to go into the void to pull her out. Not sure why this wasn't attempted earlier. By the way, I use the actor's real names because, let's be honest, who cares? It's them. There's also this side story with someone called Ghost, who got blasted years ago with quantam energy and needs a component to make a machine work because that's the same component that Michael Douglas/Evangeline needed to make the same machine work and never mind ghost never bothered asking them. Instead she hits up Larry Fishburne (who is double dippin' from the DC universe...weird). So, look, the action is fun, the wise-cracking is fun. It's really a vanilla movie, but somehow is offensive...with the Michael Pena character with a van that plays a typical Mexican tune (La Cucaracha), though he's Cuban. I don't care about that stuff and find it funny, but somehow Disney...ahem...Marvel gets away with it. Fine. It's worth the time...barely. Are these long winded side jokes the new thing? Walton Goggins being the greatest sinister bad guy is diluted to...corny banter? Does anyone NOT crackwise (even Michelle Puh-Feiffer gets a bit). It's fine, right in the middle."
753,9,"Ant Man and the wasp is the power duo of 2018!! I saw this movie with one goal in mind, to enjoy a sequel with all the action, humor, and storyline you can eat! This movie served it up just right with enough action and storyline to strike your fancy!!!I take away one star b/c of some plot-holes that lead to Infinity war part II and maybe the entrance of Cap Marvel? Idk if that's a theory or not ??????But overall, much cleaner than Infinity war to an extent... What a backstory for the shrinking super hero while everyone is fighting "" the dark one"" aka thanos!!!!!!!"
754,10,I like movie Thanks you for make the movie like the ant-max and the wasp
755,9,"SMILES EVERYONE SMILES...! Another winner from the house of Marvel which is a side story to the recent Infinity War entry in the ongoing soap opera w/capes we've come to love. Paul Rudd is a co-writer on this entry which has many story arcs but most importantly introduces Michelle Pfeiffer to the fold as Janet Van Dyne, the original Wasp & I don't about you but I can't get enough of those de-aging scenes so seeing Douglas, Pfeiffer & even Fishburne like they used to look is a joy."
756,9,Better than the first one Hilarious with enjoyable action sequences. I was not bored for a second.
757,7,"Enjoyable , entertaining but Not enough . After Infinity War here come another sequel for Ant-Man and The Wasp . As predicted Evangeline Lilly stole the show , Paul Rudd as Ant-Man not much to expect great comedy but little bit sloppy for me. Michael Pena - OMG I love this guy . Just incredible performance from him . Give that man OSCAR already.Michael Douglas as Hank Pym play another perfect role in the sequel.Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost is good but not great and she ain't Thanos level Enemy. But some part of story I don't understand why they do that , they should do this than that. Seems script ain't good as 1st Ant-Man but they did deliver it but not enough. If watching this for 1st time it is super good. After I watched 3rd time Yeah that when I saw few things and problem with this and I not going to spoiler here. Its recommended to watch this , I even buying this when Blu-Ray coming out soon.Adios"
758,8,"ANTmazing Very funny, really awesome , and refreshing. I really like this movie!"
759,6,"A Tiny Disappointment I really enjoyed the first Ant-Man, but Ant-Man and the Wasp underwhelmed me somewhat. Granted, it is hard to compete with the likes of Infinity War, Black Panther, and Thor: Ragnarok.I liked the main plot, but the various subplots didn't come together in an organic or compelling way. I wish they focused more on breaking into and exploring the quantum realm. The villain was generic and really felt like a unnecessary subplot. The comedy felt forced or was just a repeat of the previous movie.I certainly wasn't bored and it uses the shrinking and growing tech in some interesting ways, but overall I think it is a step down from the first film and the more recent Marvel films."
760,7,Enjoyable but lacked in some places The science behind a movie like this is always super shaky. It was a fun film to watch and carried on the series well without many mistakes
761,7,"Funny!!!! I love it Great and funny movie, you spend a great time, great story and jokes"
762,3,"Paint by numbers People keep predicting the end of the Superhero movie. Well, if this is an example, they may be right. This was a real paint by numbers exercise. Ant Man was really regulated to being comic relief, his ex-con pals were not that funny and the villain of the piece wasn't really a villain. I had some sympathy for Ghost, and I thought it was great they used Bill Foster (Black Goliath) as a character. (How long before people start crying that Lawrence Fishburne can't be in DC and Marvel?). Walton Goggins phoned in a performance he's done twenty times already. This film was just blah. It's always a bad sign when I start looking at my watch during a movie. A positive was Scott's interaction with Cassie. But over all, just a so-so movie."
763,8,"Definite worth seeing 7/15/18. Saw this on the big screen! Ant-man is definitely turning into one of my favorite Marvel character on the big screen. And, now as he teams up with the Wasp, they are unbeatable. One thing I like about Ant-man is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Rudd is just great in this role, and the special effects are just out of this world. Supporting cast is great. I like that they worked in Pfieffer's character into this series. Watching the post-movie extra makes me wonder what will happen next. Definitely catch this one!"
764,9,"A nice family themed movie It's surprisingly a very entertaining movie. If you expect a more fighting oriented super hero movie, this is probably not the right movie for you. But to me, this film set up a great break from the intense theme of avengers 3 and do made me laugh a lot."
765,2,"Not worth your time Easily the worst of the Marvel Universe. The entire movie could have been the last 5 minutes of the first Ant-Man. Paul Rudd felt awkward throughout, and Michael Douglas proves he's not all that great an actor.Saw this on the new ScreenX in Kansas City which was very underwhelming and not worth the extra $8."
766,9,"This is for the movie and the bad reviews. First, if you are going to give a bad opinion, make sure you actually saw the movie. Second, make sure you understand that the MCU is doing concurrent films of character buildup for future corroboration between these characters. Third, know that certain actors don't do movies with bad scripts. Last, if you are going to complain, be articulate, be clear about what you found was wrong (Cite references if possible). I cannot take anyone seriously who uses bad spelling an grammar.Overall, I enjoyed the movie as it followed the post-apocalypse Ant Man and the Wasp and how they came to be in regards to the Avengers. The key to criticizing any film based on a novel of any kind, is to read and ""comprehend"" the novel. I know this new generation isn't up on reading."
767,7,"""Do you guys just put the word 'quantum' in front of everything?"" My rating is ""just"" 7/10 but it's a good 7 -- this outing is fun and absolutely worth seeing. Like the first Ant-Man it (mostly) doesn't cut very deep but it's more than entertaining. In the two decades since superhero movies grew into a whole genre, it's taken hold so well that it's had time to split into sub-genres: there's the mainstream set (the Avengers/CA/Iron Man and X-Men series); comedy (The Incredibles, Ant-Man); horror (the upcoming New Mutants); tragedy (Logan, Superman v Batman); and now even send-up satire (Deadpool).I'm just back from seeing Ant-Man and The Wasp for a second time, and once again Marvel deserves kudos for getting a great cast together. Before I forget to say this, Abby Ryder Fortson as Scott's 10-year-old daughter Cassie, who's in on her dad's secret Ant-Man activities and is his chief cheerleader, is utterly charming. She's great. Paul Rudd again does well as a rather ordinary guy who's fallen kind of by accident into a superhero role. The co-lead Evangeline Lilly as Wasp does just fine, as she always does in her roles. So do Michael Douglas and Laurence Fishburne as former colleagues-turned-rivals. Michael Pena, who almost stole the show in Ant-Man for his sidekick riffs, is back and with a more central role. And newcomer Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Steele (Ghost) has some real screen presence. I hope we get to see her again; with Marvel's endless script ingenuity it shouldn't pose any problem.But speaking of screen presence, we have Michelle Pfeiffer (Janet Van Dyne, the original Wasp) --- though she's not on screen a lot, she takes those scenes over without doing anything flamboyant. You just can't avoid fixing on her. It seems to me they must have something in mind for Janet in future outings, given the mysterious new power she has acquired while in the Quantum Realm and which is left unexplained.The first Ant-Man (2015) succeeded so well precisely because it had a limited, well defined story and stayed within its boundaries. Unlike Avengers Infinity War the fate of the world isn't in play. Scott himself is a sort of Everyman: he's not a tech genius (Tony Stark), a god (Thor), a king (Black Panther), or a sorcerer (Dr. Strange), he hasn't been bitten by a radioactive spider, he's not a mutant, and he doesn't have special skills. He's just a guy trying to make ends meet. But the movie feeds into classic fantasies -- what if we could be really small? or really big? What if we could fly? And it seems like this movie pulls every 'tiny' setup and gag you can think of. It more or less keeps everything that worked in Ant-Man and piles a lot more into the mix. As a result, my first reaction was that there was too much material, too many subplots. However, the family and friends I was with at the theater didn't think so, and the second time around it didn't bother. Still, the central spine of the plot -- Hank, Hope, and Scott attempting to rescue Janet from the Quantum Realm -- gets lost at times in the action scenes (which are admittedly fun and inventive).OK, now some random thoughts:"
768,7,"Worthy sequel and edition to the MCU, not stellar 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' carries such a simple plot that it makes for a good time, the film does a good job at taking you out of the conundrum of grand and epic crowdedness that was 'Infinity War' and lets you take a step back and just focus on something small. Paul Rudd is strong again in the role of 'Ant-Man' but he's even better as 'Scott Lang.' When I say that I mean that Rudd and child actress Abby Ryder Fortson, do a great job with the whole father-daughter dynamic. It gives off strong feel-good vibes. Overall the acting in this movie was solid but it is the writing and comedic timing that let me down.With 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' you expect light-hearted fun, and you get that. You also expect comedy, and you get that as well, but it isn't as well placed as other recent MCU films. I did laugh in this movie as its light-hearted comedy was effective, but there were definitely more times in the film where timing is missed and jokes fall flat. I enjoy going to these films and having a good time and laughing a good bunch but I find that when comedy is trying to be inserted in times that should really be serious, these films suffer.Rudd's charisma and the charm of the cast make this film loads more enjoyable. The unlikeliness of 'Scott Lang' being a hero such as 'Ant-Man' and the unlikeliness of 'Ant-Man' being a hero at all makes him much easier to root for. The connection between Rudd and Lilly is well portrayed, but at the same time it is also rather basic and doesn't offer you much of an urge to show support or root for their bond. The villain in this film is rather weak. Unmotivated, or rather unfocused writing makes her more of a missed opportunity than anything.Good special effects and rather entertaining action sequences make for prime entertainment that is most enjoyed at the movies theatre. The dynamic of our heroes being able to shrink and enlarge in size is really fun to see be played out on the big screen. All gripes aside, I did have a fun time with this film and it was an enjoyable movie. The story was difficult to grab on to but still solid enough that it was buyable and the solid charm and charisma of the cast really sells the movie as a fun time."
769,7,"In some parts not as good as the first but in others better so......... REVIEW - ANT MAN AND THE WASPI recently reviewed the previous Ant Man film and gave it a 7 out of 10 any anyone who reads these reviews knows how I feel about sequels but honestly I've got to say this is as good as the first, so yes I'm eating my words once again.Basically this film starts off after Captain America Civil War and before Avengers Infinity War so keep this in mind because it does explain a lot of why and what is happening and what will happen.Enjoyable film with quite a few laugh out loud moments which both adults and kids will enjoy.Acting excellent, special effects amazing, story 2 running simultaneously but still easy to follow and a must see before Infinity War part 2 is released next year (no spoilers).In some parts not as good as the first but in others better so.........Rating 7 out of 10"
770,9,"Antman and the Wasp - You got the answer for ""Where is Ant-man during Infinity War?"" #AntmanAndTheWasp has the best story relating to quantum realm. It has got the epic post credits scene and it blows the audiences' minds. Marvel now linking all the movies to Infinity War Part 2. Many mysteries to be unfold in #InfinityWar2."
771,3,"Stale and not funny The plot is stale, villains are very weak compared to other marvel movies and the comedy seems forced."
772,6,"A charming enough adventure I appreciate that MCU movies have started taking themselves less and less seriously. From Guardians to Thor to Spider-man to this franchise, Marvel Studios is essentially reviving the buddy action comedies of the 1980s. Much like the first time around, Michael Pena and Paul Rudd make this film work with impeccable comedic timing. It is a charming adventure, no doubt. But the entire plot relies a bit too heavily on omnipotent technology that cannot be explained, and the stakes feel just a little low as a result. Yes, you will enjoy. Yes, you will laugh. Just don't expect it to be the best super hero movie ever...it is not even the best super hero movie of the last 6 months."
773,5,"I think this is just a movie wait for the next trailer to the other movies So this movie was enjoyable however, I didn't like the movie making Ant-Man Change his size so many times and this movie isn't at all relating to the comic. By this point I feel we only watch Ant-man to see the clip after the credits. The story of this movie was decent, however too many predictable kiss scenes and love scenes. I did however like seeing Lawrence Fishburn in this movie and for some reason was expecting a matrix line call back. Anyway I hope the next Ant-Man movie gets more improved."
774,10,A fun ride Ant man and the Wasp keeps up with the wonderful trend set by Marvel studios. Funniest one I have seen since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok.
775,8,"The ANTventure Continues Marvel's Ant-Man and The Wasp is just the entertaining comedic sequel we needed right now. While not in the same level of gravitas as the past few Marvel films. This film is charming, funny, and surprisingly heartwarming. Peyton Reed Finally gets to shine, while he directed the first one perfectly this film feels like it has his name stamped on it as opposed to the undertones Edgar Wright left behind in the first film. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily deliver some stand out performances that couldn't have been done better, Michael Douglas, Abby Ryder Foreston, and Michael Peña also return with some great character moments, and newcomers Hannah John Kamen, Walton Goggins, Michelle Phiefer, and Laurence Fishburne all do amazing in their particular roles, particularly Kamen and Fishburne who are just having the time of there lives. An innocent film with fun moments and great Comedy. Ant-Man and The Wasp delivers in all the ways it should, and I can't wait to see more from Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily in the future. At least I hope we do?"
776,8,"GOOD In an universe where all seems bit darker, there must be a remind for the funny adventure experienced atmosphere. Ant-man positively isn't the most not entertaining film among them all. He fights to top with all the others. It's funny, really, entertaining and good. Good actions, lyrics, visuals, and .... all. Cool."
777,8,"Great Fun and no Harm I don't enjoy when comic book stories take themselves grimly serious as was the case with 2018's Infinity War. I admit to having enjoyed it despite a plot hole that you could sail the Earth through, but my two favorites remain Ant Man and first Guardians.I'll add Ant Man and the Wasp right up there with those stars of the MCU. It takes a few minutes to set up but then it's off to a purely enjoyable romp which makes utterly no sense, but so what? The science in the flick won't pass a reflective kindergartener. For example, a member of our intrepid team enters the undefined 'quantum state' which is right down there in size with strings. He's attacked by a water bear. Now water bears are hardy animals but how'd they get down to string size?There's some talk about Paul Rudd getting himself in trouble with Germans which is why he's under house arrest but so little true explanation that I thought I'd missed a transition movie. Not so, advised my wife who watches these things.We have people zooming about (Ghost Girl) enlarging or reducing all to the beat of extremely fast actions and quick cuts. The cinematography is simply superb to not only show all these state changes but to show them coherently and leaving the audience upbeat rather than fatigued.Overall, great fun and no harm."
778,5,"Best Disney Marvel Movie All Decade Pretty much every single Marvel movie I have seen, all the actors speak in monotonous, fake British accents that make the movie worse than it really is. I was surprised hat they actually hired a lot of decent actors for this like Michael Douglas and Lawrence Fishburne. It started out with actual plotline, which is rare for anything Disney and the first hour was decent. But then the last hour was your typical, plot-less, scriptless, continuous violence for the sake of violence. All in all, the best Disney Marvel movie I've seen this decade."
779,7,"Enjoyable if just a bit scattered... The large number of either 1/10 or 10/10 reviews is baffling to me. This film isn't close to perfect, but neither is it remotely a terrible, 'worst of' anything example. The various plot threads are a bit scattered at times, but the core story is very focused, and is personal in nature, which helps keep the whole thing grounded, so that the humor and action are like sprinkles on top.First of all, the storyline is different from both the first Ant-Man film and all the other MCU entries, which helps distinguish it. The cast, both returning and new, very good. Michelle Pfeiffer and Walton Goggins are both a bit underutilized, but nonetheless they both add to the net chemistry onscreen. There are plenty of fun, easy-to-follow action scenes, and there's a lot of humor, although as with the first Ant-Man film, the offbeat style is hit-and-miss. As someone else pointed out, some of the jokes are telegraphed from miles away, and some of them chase the awkward-decay dragon a little too far. Also, the multiple villainous subplots are all underdeveloped, in spite of the occasions that they give for the heroes to do cool stuff.But generally, this film is light on its feet, has a nice soundtrack and a great sense of visual interest accented by the west coast setting and some really cool effects, and again, a story that is firmly rooted in personal relationships. I found all of that really enjoyable. And just seeing the Wasp in action, finally, is a lot of fun. This film isn't great, but it's like a bunch of entertaining lights strung around a solid emotional core. I like these character and won't forget this adventure of theirs. I hope they get a threequel."
780,5,"A Good Sequel Coming in as a sequel to one of the most forgettable MCU films 'Ant-Man', 'Ant-Man and The Wasp' manages to be better than that and has enough substance in it to keep the audience engaged. Michael Pena's Luis gives the comedic tone that was much needed for this film to avoid being a mediocre one. Paul Rudd too, along with being a superhero also provides some warmth to the film. 'The Ghost' can be considered as a disappointing villain which means that it broke Marvel's streak of good villains that started with Killmonger in 'Black Panther' and ended with Thanos in 'Avengers: Infinity War'. The film had a lot of forced exposition and weak, unnatural character development. The film digs deeper and explores the Quantum Realm, giving as a clue of what could happen in 'Avengers 4'. Also, the post-credits are directly connected to the ending of 'Avengers: Infinity War.'"
781,8,"Improvement on First Installment ANT-MAN AND THE WASP - I think this is going to be one of my smallest reviews , even if i actually liked the movie. I just don't find anything much to write about it , it was just fun .The first ANT-MAN was among my least fav MCU movies. Its just that i dont like comedy superhero films , not unless they go R rated like DEADPOOL or having extremely unique humor like THOR3. But ANT-MAN and The WASP is an improvement on its first installment. But the plot iwas very basic , like the first one. The only thing which improved was The Jokes , which i thought were just above average in the first one , but here they are good , and the facial expression of both Paul Rudd and Michale Pena were great. Paul Rudd is one of the best comic actor working in Hollywood , and ANT-MAN certainly gets benefit from it.Like i said , the plot was very basic (although i don't write plot-points in my reviews but here as i don't have much to write m gonna mention some , also plot was no secret in the movie). First and most importantly Hope Van Dyan was trying to find her mother using Quantom Mechanics , then there was a villain called GHOST , who was trying to steal something from them to save herself , and then there was another villain to steal the same thing to sell it in the black market. Now the whole movie just shows that particular thing to be circulated between different character as its been stolen again and again from one or other . But the jokes just keep coming everytime in the movie , which makes u to just ignore that the movie was just jumping from one set piece to another without happening much between them, also the set pieces were really good . Nothing on the level of what Russo Brothers did with ANT-MAN in the Airport scene in Civil War but it came close.The bad villain problem with MCU just continues with this movie.3d in the movie was very effective.Also i liked how they connected it to INFINITY WAR in the mid credit scenes.So thats it , a fun and very entertaining movie , with a basic plot , good innovating but nothing extravaganza actions scenes , and superb comedic performance by Paul Rudd and Michale Pena .7.6/10ANuP APu KuMaR"
782,7,"Better Than The First one The starting is a little bit slow. The Plot was good and Paul Rudd did a good job, the villain could have been a little bit better. Ghost was definitely better than Darren Cross. Overall it was a good movie."
783,7,"Finally you will got the answer why Ant Man was absent in Infinity War Direction:After huge success of Ant Man, Peyton Reed is back to the chair of director for this sequel. Reed did his job perfectly as linking with previous installment and execution was super. He brilliantly showcase emotional bonding among Scott & her Daughter Cassie and Hank & Hope.Performance:Paul Rudd once again proved his mantle in lead role. Evangeline Lilly looks confident in the role of Wasp. Indeed good chemistry between Rudd and Litty which one is the pillar of this movie. Hannah John-Kamen did good job in the role of ghost but her charter can be more dark so that this movie can have better villain. Abby Ryder Fortson is really cute and impressive one. Michael Douglas is the back bone of this movie. Good comedy by Michael Peña, Tip ""T.I."" Harris and David Dastmalchian.Script:Script was piece of witty writing but weak negative charter diluted the intensity of this installment. Chase sequence with Large or Small feature make it funny ride in 3D. Truth Serum also added more humor in the story.Dialogues:""Do you guys have every thing start with Quantum"". This is just a sample of witty dialogues.Connection with Avengers series:This movie will answer you regarding absence of Ant Man during attack by Thanos. It means that you will able to see some action from Ant Man in the next part of Avengers.Last Words:Watch it as you do not feel sad when next installment of Avengers hit the cinema hall."
784,10,"A great time. Very funny just like the first one. Paul Rudd is likable and charming as usual. The wasp can kick butt in this one, which compliments Ant-Man really well. A great entertaining movie for when you just want to kick back and have a good laugh. And the action in this is great by the way."
785,7,"Another Light-Hearted Adventure Honestly, I really should penalise this movie, or at least the MCU in general, for getting rid of Edgar Wright from the previous instalment of Ant-man. Then again, I suspect that there is something about working for MCU that a self-styled director like Wright would end up clashing with. In fact, sometimes I feel that with the MCU the director really doesn't have as much creative control over a movie as they would have in their own works, which is probably why Wright in the end didn't make a good fit. However, with that off my chest, I guess I'll just judge the movie based on, well, the movie as opposed to the background shenanigans. Yeah, this film was actually pretty cool, and certainly provides a few answers to some questions that we had at the end of Infinity War, namely where the hell was Ant-man? Well, now we know - he was under house arrest, and through a court order he was not allowed to associate with any of the Avengers once his house detention had come to an end. It turns out that out of everybody that was involved in the shenanigans at Leipzig Airport, it seems as if he was the only one that actually got arrested (though once again the wear-a-bouts of Hawkeye is still a mystery). The other thing is that while there are bad guys in the film, in regards to the actual plot they are really only a side show - there are much more important things in the minds of our protagonists, particularly Scott, who just wants to get over his current incarceration and once again spend time with his daughter. However, it seems as if Hank Pym and his daughter have other ideas (though he isn't allowed to actually have any contact with them either, and further they also happen to be on the run from the police). Remember how in the previous film Scott went into the quantum realm and returned? Well, that plays a very big role in this film, but then again I probably shouldn't be all that surprised considering we are talking about people who can shrink themselves at will (and also grow pretty big, though that has problems in and of itself). Also, remember that at the end of the previous film Hank revealed a new suit for his daughter to wear. Well, that is why we now have the Wasp appearing in this film, though at first the relationship does tend to be a little strained, with the whole Leipzig thing and all that. Yeah, I thought the film was actually pretty good, but then again the MCU certainly does seem to be able to produce some pretty polished films these days. Also, the whole bad guys really only being an obstacle to the actual goal as opposed to whose defeat is actually the end in itself also gives it a bit more of a polish than what you tend to get with many films. I guess the whole beat the bad guy and walk away happy does get a bit tiring after a while."
786,10,"Really Awesome #AntManAndTheWasp is an Awesome and Fun #Movie One of the Best Science Fiction Movies in #MarvelCinematicUniverse #QuantumRealm is Incredible, Crazy and Really Terrifying Stroy and Characters are More Awesome with a Good Villain #Ghost #CreditScene Lives up to #InfinityWar's Big Event"
787,7,"A Funny and Welcome Detour from the Heavy Material in 'Infinity War' Is Paul Rudd ever not likable? No, right? He's always wonderful, and he's wonderful once again in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp.'This sequel is a lot like the first one except Hope, the Wasp, plays an expanded role while wearing an upgraded suit and boasting a much more developed skill set than Scott, a.k.a. Ant-Man. They work well together, after Hank and Hope drag Scott away from his ongoing two-year house arrest.Scott's efforts to avoid being caught leaving his house lead to some very funny exchanges between him and Randall Park's law enforcement character, who is impressed by Scott's newly learned close-up magic tricks. Park is a criminally underappreciated comic actor, and it's great to see him have a chance to play a significant role in a hit movie like this one.But Scott avoids getting caught, and he's able to help his pals, so everything is going smoothly. That is until a woman with odd ghost powers (Hannah John-Kamen) shows up and steals the new tech Hank is building to save his wife from the quantum realm. Now Ant-Man and the Wasp must battle the ghost/help the ghost, because help is what she is actually seeking. Her powers aren't really powers-they're a curse that causes her great pain.The ghost character is fairly interesting but should have been more so. She is so uneven. In one scene she comes across as this awkward, creepy flirt, then she never returns to any similar behavior, which was disappointing. I liked seeing her hit on Scott in her own bizarre way, and I thought that would have been a far more entertaining personality than the angry blank slate we see in the rest of the film. I couldn't quite figure out what she was supposed to be, and I don't think the filmmakers could either.In much of the movie, as expected, there are plenty of laughs. A few moments when the size regulator on Scott's suit malfunctions, causing him to grow and shrink at the most inopportune times, are particularly hilarious. Michael Pena is fire once again as he rattles off a couple of his character's classic motormouth stories, one while under the influence of a substance that may or may not be truth serum.Paul Rudd is funny too, but the humor felt a little incongruous. In the first film, we saw Scott as a smart and capable burglar, yet in this movie he is much more of a bumbling fool. It felt like the writers compromised his character for the sake of few jokes.Overall, this is certainly a much lighter film than 'Infinity War' and one with smaller stakes. I'm okay with that. I thought I wanted answers about what is to come in 'Avengers 4,' but it turns out I was perfectly content watching an enjoyable, funny Marvel movie."
788,10,"fANTastic! Funny and charming Alright, so I'm giving this movie ten stars because after the trauma of Infinity War, this just made me incredibly happy. There were so many hilarious scenes, dialogue and characters. I laughed so much in the theatre, it was a fun refresher.No, this does not have the scale of Infinity War or Black Panther or Civil War. But it's still an amazing movie, about family, and saving family. Unconventional and not. Scott has a beautiful, heartwarming relationship with his daughter. The wit and humour is on point. They may not be saving the world or the universe, but bigger doesn't mean better. (Though Giant Man is back, giant ants are playin' the drums, giant pez dispensers are flyin' through the city, and also in a movie like this, small scale is big scale).People are complaining that there's too much going on. I don't know why no one can handle sub plots anymore? It's got a story that's not just mindless action? What's the problem? I've seen far more complicated movies, so if two subplots is too much to handle, that's on you.I really enjoyed this movie, and I really want other people to go and enjoy it too."
789,8,It's good It's a good movie app but it was so fun to watch it and I got to see the new one on my watch it is fun 8/10
790,9,"Great Fun Movie--Pay No Attention To Those Whiners It really was. Funny, suspenseful, touching, fast paced, a decent plot. After all the raving over Thor: Rag, I thought this was way smarter humor and more convincing story. I liked Paul Rudd and Angeline Lily's chemistry. I liked the Ghost's character. Michael Pena was hilarious. CGI was well done and transitions from big to small were smooth. Also proves you can make a decent fun movie without gratuitous gore-- and the worst language I recall was bad-ass, which I believe I heard used in Incredibles 2. Maybe I'm just tired of movie makers thinking that someone yelling the F word five times in every scene or hacking up bodies, is clever or entertaining or a substitute for a decent script and acting. I say well done, good job. I give this a 9/10."
791,10,"Matches up to & even surpasses its predecessor. Ant-Man and the Wasp takes place after the events of Ant-Man(2015) & Captain America: Civil War(2016). Scott Lang/Ant-Man(Paul Rudd) teams up with Hope Van Dyne/Wasp(Evangeline Lilly). With the help of mentor Dr. Hank Pym(Michael Douglas), Scott & Hope have to work together to discover something crucial, that will unravel secrets from their past.Ant-Man and the Wasp is an awe-inspiring film. Director Peyton Reed has maintained all the quirks, gags, one-liners & unique action, that made Ant-Man(2015) such a thoroughly enjoyable movie. The visual effects are magnificent. The 3D(especially in IMAX) puts you right in the middle of the action onscreen. The action set pieces are mind-blowing, with the stand out being the climactic one. The performances are the highlight of the film. Paul Rudd is spectacular as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Rudd exudes his natural charisma & wit in his portrayal. Evangeline Lilly is outstanding as Hope Van Dyne/Wasp. Lilly's 'no-nonsense, always gets the job done' character perfectly complements Rudd's more goofy character. Paul Rudd & Evangeline Lilly share electrifying chemistry together. Michael Pena is hysterical as Luis. Walton Goggins is great as Sonny Burch. Bobby Cannavale & Judy Greer are good as Paxton & Maggie, respectively. Tip 'T.I.' Harris & David Dastmalchian are impressive as Dave & Kurt, respectively. Hannah John-Kamen is brilliant as Ava/Ghost. Abby Ryder Fortson is adorable as Cassie. Randall Park is superb as Jimmy Woo. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as Janet Van Dyne/Wasp. Laurence Fishburne is effective as Dr. Bill Foster. Michael Douglas is awesome as Dr. Hank Pym. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a must watch. Another flawless Marvel Cinematic Universe movie."
792,6,"Funny (as the majority of the MCU movies), but they've lost their hand in the plot Besides the weak villan, I really enjoyed Ant-Man (the first one). It was fun, the characters were likeable and it seemed refreshing, a kind of an heist movie into the MCU. Really, the only thing that held the film back was the villan.But here, in Ant-Man and the Wasp, they've followed almost the exact same formulas that've worked before, with one ""plus"" (which is the badass Wasp). Besides that, it almost seemed like if they didn't try to fix the last movie's problems. They just didn't care.Like the villan, without spoilers, the thing doesn't have a villan. Really guys, you can watch, and see. But the ""Ghost"", who the trailers sell as the main villan, is not a villan. You kind of care about the character, and understand what she is doing. And she isn't exactly against our main heroes. Which leaves us with a random guy (who I think was suppose to be some sort of villan), who chases them at some point. They were able to develop a worst ""villan situation"" then in the first one. ""You know what? Nevermind, we don't need a villan, right?""The other thing that bothered me a lot was the way they dealt with the ""Original Wasp"" thing, that is something they've introduced in the first film, kind of letting it in the air. But they just, do not explain anything. In fact, there is ONE LINE that she talks about what might have happened to her in the Quanton Realm. Yes, 30 years that she has spent in a new dimension, and this is all she has to talk about. This is the whole plot of the movie, the whole mission is about that, and they didn't even worry about leting us know what it is in fact about.I don't know, I guess this is just one reflex of this new ""it's all connected"" thing that Marvel have created. We may see some talk about that in Avengers 4. But it's just wrong, you know? A movie was supposed to work by itself or am I crazy? I mean, a good movie should.But, don't get me wrong, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a good movie, but it just lacks more development in some parts. But, Ant-Man is funny once again (even though he seemed kind of ""dummier"" this time around), Luis steals the movie (again), Michael Douglas is great as Hank Pym, and the Wasp is INCREDIBLE! It was really the right call to not have her in Civil War, it would have been such an underuse.Another GREAT surprise was Scott's daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson), she is SO CUTE! Man! She is definitely one highlight of the movie, every scene she is in it's great to see (even more when she is with her father). And, of course, it's an AMAZING kid's performance, she can act, indeed.To sum up, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a good film, entertaining, funny and light (as almost every single MCU movie), but it just fails to be something else, in fact, it seems like they weren't even trying to be more than just ""good"".6,5/10"
793,7,"Entertaining and....That's all about it Go there expecting a revelation and you will be disappointed. If I remember the trailer when it was released, it promised a fun filled summer entertainer. And that's what it has managed to do. The plot is utterly predictable and most of the plot points just go over the head. Still we however get a gist of what they are up to after all that ""quantum"" stuff. The humor is very neat though. Quirky and juicy moments of laughter fuel the movie till end. Speaking of the ending....I'm not feeling good Mr Reader....."
794,7,"Fittingly Bigger Than the First Marvel Comics' Ant-Man's powers consist of both growing and shrinking to heights outside of the norms of nature. Ant-Man and the Wasp, the sequel to the 2015 superhero-comedy hit and the 19th picture in the unstoppable MCU, emulates its character's abilities. In its humor and clearly focused stakes, it towers above its Avenger cohorts. In its series import and villain menace, it's in danger of being stepped on. In whole, this sci-fi-actioner sits lightly alongside its brethren with the ease of Paul Rudd's charm. We pickup Scott Lang's story years after he was placed under house arrest for breaking his parole in the airport fight in Civil War. Having betrayed the secretive trust of Lily and Douglas's characters, he is trying to make amends by helping them retrieve what they need to re-enter the quantum zone and save their mother / wife. Because of the breezy tone and familiar plotting, there isn't much actual tension in any of the numerous conflicts. Instead, the fun is in the comedic action and character interplay, with Pena continuing his Ant-Man streak of stealing every hilarious scene he's in. In comparison to 2015's Ant-Man, this is funnier, bigger and better, with director Reed having a much stronger handle on the material than when he was given the unenviable job of taking over from Edgar Wright (Baby Driver, Hot Fuzz) 3 years ago. Really though, there's not much else to talk about here. It's a perfectly diverting laugh-a-minute adventure tale whose slightness in importance makes it a fine if uneventful MCU entry."
795,9,MARVEL !!!! As expected Ant-Man and the Wasp is a light comedy and totally a love story with lots of TRUTH SERUM :DJust dont miss the post credit scene if u list avenger 4 in your upcoming movie view list.
796,5,"Not Bad but a let down nonetheless This film was a let down in my opinion. It was not as good as the first. This whole film just felt empty. There was no substance or passion, if you will. There where a few good moments and the actions scenes were entertaining. The most enjoyable part of the film was probably just the wasp. If you liked the first you might enjoy this one too. Go see it if you really want to."
797,8,"The movie is above all else funny. 'ANT-MAN AND THE WASP': Four Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to Marvel Studio's 2015 superhero flick 'ANT-MAN' (based on the popular Marvel Comics' character), and the 20th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In this installment Ant-Man/Scott Lang teams with The Wasp/Hope van Dyne, and Hank Pym, to rescue Hope's mother from the quantum realm. It was once again directed by Peyton Reed, and Paul Rudd once again stars in the film. Rudd also once again co-wrote it as well (with Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari). Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Peña, Walton Goggins, Hannah John-Kamen, Laurence Fishburne, Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer and Randall Park also costar in the movie. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics (like the first) and it's of course another big hit at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed it slightly more than the original (which I wasn't a huge fan of either).Two years after the events of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', Scott Lang (Rudd) is almost done with house arrest for his crimes. When Hank Pym (Douglas) and Hope van Dyne (Lilly) learn that Hope's mother is alive, and caught in the quantum realm, they break Scott out of his home in order to help them. Scott reluctantly goes along with their plan, and he becomes Ant-Man once again. While Hope also becomes The Wasp, and the two become a superhero duo!The movie is above all else funny. The action scenes are amusing and creative as well, and Rudd is just totally likable in the lead. So the film has a lot going for it. What it doesn't have going for it though, is a coherent story, or a good strong villain. I did definitely enjoy it a little more than the original though, and I'm sure Marvel fans will love it."
798,10,"An out and out entertainer which does justice to the expectations. After watching INFINITY WAR, I watched (and liked) all the remaining films of the MCU, including ANT-MAN. When I heard about ANT-MAN AND THE WASP, I started to await its release. Today, as I watched the film in 4DX 3D, I was totally satisfied and entertained by the time it ended. Throughout the most of the duration, I had a smile on my face.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly's superhero pair is one of the best things to happen to this film. It's a bright, colorful, fun action-adventure which deserves to be seen on the big screen for its spectacular action sequences, splendid visual effects, and a perfect screenplay. Michael Peña's comedy is once again rib-tickling and extremely hilarious. The editing was so good that I didn't realize how 2 hours passed by. The film is enjoyable to the core and a perfect summer entertainer to be watched with family and friends (I watched it alone, however).It was great how the film moved at a very fast pace, without cutting down on anything important. The light tone is also what works in its favor. The film has a heart, and that too in the right place.I would recommend watching it in 4DX because the action sequences are just so great that you would like to be a part of them. Particularly a car chase sequence which is both filmed and choreographed so well that I'm gonna put it on my list of top favorite car chases as well the film on top favorite action movies list at the same time.Shrinking and expanding during the action is just outstanding. It feels really marvelous to watch, and thus you must watch it if you enjoy superhero movies. ANT-MAN AND THE WASP is the year's third best summer blockbuster in a row after INFINITY WAR and DEADPOOL 2. Just make sure you stay till the end; don't read any spoilers on the internet, as there are some unexpected surprises bound to leave an unforgettable impact."
799,6,The ending saved this movie A poor sequel to a great Marvel creation. Too much 'talk talk talk talk' you actually wait for something amazing to happen. Some fun scenes involving shrinking cars and good fight scenes here there. To summarise: Marvel should not leap into this present era by moving too quick to release what should be Epic classic motion comics.
800,6,Saved by the funny script.. Ant man and the wasp was a bit disappointing compared to other marvel movies. It was fast tracked and the plot itself was dull. Good thing it was funny which i think is a new trend for Marvel movies to no get bored in their long plotless movies..
801,8,"Beats the first The first movie took a lot of time to get going; this one gets rolling, with maybe too much going on right through the end. Rudd hits the spot, Lilly (Hobbit) does pretty well as the Wasp. The Ant Man films have their own sort of goofy, less serious aura, this one doesn't surprise. Maybe a tad too long but a decent ride."
802,1,WORST MOVIE EVER PACING WAS AWFUL ACTING WAS AWFUL AND THE WRITING WAS AWFUL!!! DONT GO TO THIS MICIE ITS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!
803,4,"Comedy over Action Distraction ANT-MAN should have his name changed to Size-Shifter. That's what he does, and what everyone around him does. And every single thing for that matter: from buildings to suits to vehicles. Which makes sense because there's only so many visual gags where you see a Hot Wheels-size car rolling down the street in its realistic silence after being loudly inside it during an action scene set-up...Still, those moments are kinda funny, and maybe the best thing going for ANT-MAN AND THE WASP, yet another Marvel sequel that seems more made for the cast & crew of inside-joke-sharing friends than an audience of strangers that need a dose of old-school entertainment. With a barrage of family oriented plot-lines, including elder genius Hank Pym's ex partner helping a badass female anti-heroine named Ghost; or Pym himself trying to free his beloved wife (and Wasp's beloved mom) from an inner-space dimension visually liken to FANTASTIC VOYAGE and...Well you better get used to the sciencey stuff because this ANT-MAN hardly takes a physical step forward without a ton of rambling exposition while constantly reminding us of the CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, after which Paul Rudd's much more mellow and this time, lethargically-sarcastic ex-thief got on house-arrest where he spends corny playtime with his daughter...Thankfully, Evangeline Lilly keeps him centered while her dad (with his past catching up) really just gets in the way: Making the entire third act... taking place on the famously steep streets of San Fransisco (where Michael Douglas feels at home)... a prolonged chase-epic homage to BULLITT, and feeling more like a fresh start from all the previous get-the-important-device-back-in-time frenzy, rather than the winding-down of what eventually tries to be the same kind of urgent heist flick that the original was most of the way through. And Michael Peña, the comic relief, isn't funny. At all. Because he never stops constantly trying to be."
804,8,"A really funny and engaging movie! I think this is one of the better Marvel movies, with humor making me and my family laugh like Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers movies. I really liked the fact that the movie didn't take itself too seriously, especially when everything had ""quantum"" as an adjective. Quantum healing energies was hilarious :P because the movie made fun of itself! If it didn't, I'd be picking holes in it most likely, lol. Great movie, definitely worth a watch!"
805,8,"That end credit scene..... Even by Marvel standards, this felt like a comedy. This is to be taken with a grain of salt, of course, considering the last Marvel film prior to this was Infinity War, setting the standard to be powerful and dramatic. Ant-Man and his airborne companion certainly left me feeling unfulfilled in the drama department but made up for it with heart-warming bits of fatherhood, well-written comedy, and a satisfying romance tale. The best part of this movie, however, is the first end credit scene. That left me completely shook."
806,8,"Fun summer blockbuster Director Peyton Reed's follow up to 2015's ""Ant-Man"", titled ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", is just what the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) needed to lighten the mood after the dark ""Avengers: Infinity War"". While mostly disposable entertainment, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun, light-hearted sequel that is more in line with what we have come to expect from a summer blockbuster superhero movie.Picking up roughly two years after the events of ""Ant-Man"", Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is under house arrest after helping Captain America during the events of Civil War, thus violating the Sokovia Accords. One night Scott has a dream of a woman who he believes to be Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), the long lost mother of Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and wife of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Soon after, he calls Hank, who is in hiding with Hope, and eventually meets up with them. Their mission is to go into the quantum realm via a quantum tunnel and bring back Janet, who has been trapped in the quantum realm since 1987.Ant-Man and the Wasp ultimately shines because of Peyton Reed's surefire direction and its superb cast. Ant-Man and the Wasp knows what it is and executes it very well. It's not a movie that takes itself seriously like Infinity War. Instead, it goes the more comedic, conventional summer movie route, and there's nothing wrong with that as long as it's fun, which it is. In fact, it's probably the most fun I've had at the theaters this year, and it earns major props for that. This experience wouldn't be the same without a super solid cast that consists of Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Peña. While watching the movie, I was reminded that this is easily one of the best casts we've had for a standalone MCU movie.Going into the movie, many will probably wonder how the story ties into the events of Infinity War, or if it has anything to do with Infinity War at all. These questions aren't exactly answered or made clear until after the movie is over, in which we see a shocking post-credit scene that ties directly into Infinity War and leaves us with a lot of anticipation for what's to come in the subsequent MCU movies.All in all, Ant-Man and the Wasp accomplishes what it set out to do, and that was to provide popcorn entertainment to its audience and be a nice change of pace from Infinity War. Sure, it's mostly disposable, but it sticks to its vision and for a summer blockbuster superhero movie, what more could you ask for?"
807,9,"Way better than the first one I really didn't like the first movie. I hated the villain, I hated Evangeline Lily's hairstyle and I didn't enjoy the plot. This one felt different. I think it is a huge step forward for Hope's character. ""The Wasp"" in the title is really deserved and I really liked her character (and her hairstyle) in this one. The villain was believable and interesting. I found myself leaving the cinema and wanting to know more about her. I think Marvel, since the Spider-Man movie last year, got rid of their villain problem. I was really worried about this one but it turned out to be alright. I really laughed during this one, but it was expected. Although it was really enjoyable, it was not perfect. I had a problem with some of the plot elements and some special effects, but again the result was a good movie. Go watch it if you are a Marvel fan. People who are not very familiar with the MCU may find themselves not understanding the whole movie and thus not enjoy it. I think it's worth a watch."
808,6,"A fun but rather underwhelming ride in Marvel's hot streak of great comic book movies. Director: Peyton Reed Screenplay: Paul Rudd, Gabriel Ferrari, Chris McKenna, Andrew BarrerComing off the heels of Avengers Infinity War, we get Ant Man and the Wasp. I really like the first Ant Man, it was a funny small scale heist movie with a comic book spin and that film played up what it was while giving us great characters in the process. Ant Man and the Wasp had it's funny moments and the action was top notch. When you have characters like Ant Man you need to show the audience why they are cool and the action certainly displays that for us. I also enjoy the plot line involving the quantum realm, that being said there are many other plot lines that get in the way and really hurt this movie. Honestly I was a bit let down with this sequel. They really made Scott Lang a ""back seat"" character this time around. The plot treated him like an annoyance sometimes. It felt as if Evangeline Lilly and Micheal Douglas were the stars while they treated Scott Lang like the kid that screws everything up, but that's not what the first movie established. Scott Lang is actually a pretty smart and efficient character. I feel like this film forgot that. The main villain had so much potential! Ghost had a very interesting back story and I was really excited to see her development but they just waist her screen time and focus on the arms dealer that was completely pointless to the plot in the first place. You could have had those crooks working for Ghost that way we could really get a solid final villain fight and confrontation but we don't get those either. I never felt like this movie earned the title Ant Man and the Wasp. There was never a moment where I thought, ""Yes there is a duo right there!"" Even for an Ant Man movie the jokes were a little too much sometimes getting in the way of potentially great emotional moments for certain character's development. Honestly on the ride home from the theater I just got to thinking, and I have to say that there are a lot of things that just irked me about this movie. I saw the potential for greatness in many scenes but the film doesn't take those chances. The plot jumps all over the place and while I really enjoy Hope as a character I don't buy the romance or the duo vibe with her and Scott Lang. This comic book adventure was very funny at times, the action was amazing and it was also confidently directed by Peyton Reed. My issues mainly come with the screenplay and plot structure. There are so many MCU movies, not all of them will be great. I didn't hate this movie, I'm just disappointed honestly. Am I the only one?"
809,6,A comedy or action film? Funny parts? Weak action story. Struggled to figure out what kind of a movie it was.
810,6,"Nothing as compared to the first 'Ant-Man' film. I was waiting for this anticipated movie but it felled flat for numerous reasons. The comedy was irritable, and a bit recycled. The father-daughter bonding...we have seen a million times. Even the heist act. Do we really care for Pym's wife? Only the end credits was the highlight of the movie.Not interested in the third installment."
811,8,"Fun PG superhero movie This movie is great fun with humour, well choreographed action scenes and a descent plot. Lots of good actors add to the authenticity as do the effects.It's not quite at the quality of Black Panther, but is a very enjoyable watch."
812,6,"Jokes may be impressive but not the plot MCU has given my all time favourite movie Avenger Infinity War, but this one lacks with the plot. As MCU movies have light theme, this one also have impressive jokes but the plot disappoint. Not a good plot but as MCU fan you must watch."
813,8,"Pretty Great I loved the first Ant Man and at that particular point I needed an Ant Man in the MCU. Same with the sequel. After IW, I wanted some fun. AM&TW takes place roughly two years after AM and A:CW and just before IW (come on, people, MCU has been building up to IW for 10 years, don't tell me you haven't been paying attention to the timeline even though the movies haven't been released chronologically!). I never thought anyone was any real danger, but I thought the pacing was excellent. The humor is wonderful, The Wasp is an inspiration to all Little Princesses. The ""villain"" was a character people could sympathize with (maybe they learned something from Killmonger in BP), and I even liked the throwaway comic villain as he provided the reason for some real action near the end. Was it an orchestral masterpiece? No. But it was everything *I* want from an afternoon at the movies. Quick, funny, jokes that are running from the first installment and a great ""OH NO THEY DIDN'T"" mid-credits scene to make you remember where you are. I loved it."
814,8,"A lot of fun! Movie was a lot of fun and a nice, comedic break from the dramatic heights of infinity war. Very funny with great action scenes and does a good job of further diving into the ""quantum realm"". Storyline a little inconsistent but over all great marvel movie!"
815,6,"So MCU's doing hearty family action comedies now? As was heavily promoted by Marvel in the run-up to the film's release, Ant-Man and the Wasp takes place between the events of Civil War and Infinity War as Scott Lang's decision to join with Cap and his rebels in violation of the government-backed Sokovia Accords broke up a budding crime-fighting partnership with Hope van Dyne, seemingly stopping their exploration into the mysterious Quantum Realm from advancing any further.Ant-Man and the Wasp picks up two years later, with Scott cut off from Hope and Hank Pym, and days away from completing a sentence on house arrest. A bizarre dream where Scott encounters Hope's mother Janet - thought hopelessly lost in the Quantum Realm decades earlier - brings the trio back together to find her.If only it was that simple! Soon, their plans to breach the Quantum Realm and rescue Janet are complicated by intervention from the FBI, sinister industrialist Sonny Burch (a moustache-twirling Walton Goggins without an actual moustache) and the mysterious Ghost.There's an added weight on Ant-Man and the Wasp because it is the first time a female superhero has been included in the title of an MCU project. Make no mistake that Evangeline Lilly lives up to that distinction and gives the standout performance of this film.The emotional core at the center of the film is the promise of Hope potentially being reunited with the mother who was deprived of raising her. Without giving away any spoilers, both Evangeline Lilly and Michelle Pfeiffer get moments to play through the pathos of their past heartbreak, with Paul Rudd even becoming an unlikely conduit for their separation at one point.Along with Lilly and Pfeiffer, Hannah John-Kamen is another notable standout. The Game of Thrones star turns in a nuanced performance as Ghost, who is able to phase through solid substances. The classic Marvel character has been gender-swapped by director Peyton Reed from its traditional Marvel Comics portrayal here.It would be more accurate to call John-Kamen's Ghost an antagonist rather than a villain, since she shares far more in common with complex MCU characters like Killmonger from Black Panther than the more outwardly monstrous types like Thanos or the Red Skull. John-Kamen brings a childlike quality to the role that pays off well when the motivations for Ghost's actions are revealed.And those DC fans who were left feeling frustrated that an acting great like Laurence Fishburne was largely wasted simply standing around and grumbling as Daily Planet editor Perry White in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman will be pleased to know that he actually gets something interesting to do in Ant-Man and the Wasp. As Pym's former colleague Bill Foster, it's great fun to watch Fishburne verbally spar with fellow Hollywood legend Michael Douglas.Any true Marvel fan also knows by now to stick around for the post-credits sequences, and in this case, people should definitely stick around for the mid-credits sequence this time.Occasionally, Marvel credits scenes are more of a lark than an actual tease of what's to come (Avengers eating Shawarma, we're looking at you), but the first of two post-credits scenes in Ant-Man and the Wasp genuinely seems like a nod to both the future (and maybe even the past) of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In terms of the second post-credits sequence, well, if you're in a hurry to get home, you won't be too fussed to have missed it..."
816,10,"Amazing!! Amazing!! Wasp steals the show,Evangeline Lilly is perfect on the role,badass and charismatic. The visual effects and action scenes are amazing,the humor is on point and super funny."
817,4,"Probably worse MCU film to date Pretty poor effort with this one. First Ant-Man movie was great, this one not so much. Paul Rudds acting was so laboured, like he was trying to channel Jim Carrey or something.The plot was average and boring, a kind of Finding Nemo but less exciting. Ant-Man has so much potential and uses but they went with some poor family sitcom feel."
818,8,"A very fun and entretaining film The Marvel cinematic Universe has The their small scale and big scale films and AntMan and The Wasn't is on the small scale category.This film might look underwhelming compared to Infinity War which is The biggest film yet of the franchise and maybe Marvel made mistake on the release order.Maybe AntMan and The Wasp should have come first so it wouldn't feel that underwhelming or disappointing.But still I have to say it's a really fun and entretaining film.It has humor, some nice touching moments and lots of action. The film delivers what it promises to be and left me with a smile on my face at the end.I love both films of Marvel.their big scale stuff like Infinity War, Civil War and The Avengers And also their smaller scale films made just for fun like: The First IronMan, AntMan And SpiderMan.If you enjoy the smaller scale films you will be not be disappointed but if you always except the grand spectacle of Infinity War then this one will look a little underwhelming."
819,8,"One of the best Marvel films yet This movie may not match the scope of Black Panther and Infinity War, but this pint-sized adventure is fun for the whole family! However, if you have not seen Infinity War, or your child is sensitive, do not stay after the credits! SPOILER: Hope, Janet, and Hank are all killed in Thanos' snap."
820,10,Great watch Really enjoyed watching this movie and would recommend!
821,6,Classic Marvel There is not much to say about it. It's a mid tier marvel movie. Michael Peña is great as always and he carries the fun parts. Villian starts as a interesting character but she lost my interest in short amount of time. I can say same thing about the movie itself first half did better job in entertaining than the secont half. My conclusion is that it's a mid tier marvel movie you probably will have fun but don't expect a great movie.
822,10,"Ants in my pants man All the other reviews can not be compared to my review. This is certainly the most superior review. I'll leave you with suspense, therefore I will not tell you about this movie. That is review psychology 101. I am the Hitchcock of critics. kneel before me while I review movies like a true critic. SPOILER ALERT. I drown ant man with the sweat of my brow while working so hard on my masterful reviews."
823,8,"If Infinity War was main course, then this is a nice refreshing cup of peppermint tea. After the huge scale and destruction of Infinity War, the last thing we needed was another 2 hours of cities being destroyed and people disintegrating. And besides the post- credit scene, Ant Man and the Wasp is a fast-paced-slow-start-but-still-a-fun-time."
824,10,Light but meaningful If you don't enjoy the laughs this movie brings to the table then your sense of humor is seriously lacking.On that note I feel as though it touched on a probable solution to the outcome of Infinity War and only made me more excited for the future of MCU.If you want to explore the funny side of MCU I recommend checking out the second installment of Ant-man and most importantly make sure to stay for the mid AND post-credit scenes.
825,8,"Ant-Man & The Wasp: Generic Story & Slow Start, but a great 2nd Half It's another year in Hollywood, and that means that it's time for another round of Marvel movies. Each year since Phase 3 began, Disney and Marvel Studios have been releasing three movies per year. That may seem like an overload, but each film has come to feel like a fresh and unique take on a similar story. The last of 2018's Marvel movies, Ant-Man and The Wasp, also offers its own signature take on humor and action to move the typical storyline forward. That storyline is to defeat bad guys who are chasing what the good guys are chasing, but there are definitely different elements added to the story that set this film apart. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and wish to watch it again. Now, I am going to elaborate on this.I like to begin with the negative aspects of a movie because a positive view on life is to view the good in everything in the end. I have also been superstitious for many years, with one aspect of superstition being that I believe that the best is always saved for last. With this viewpoint established, I will say that the movie does begin quite slow and doesn't have the greatest initial buildup. This isn't to say that I don't like slow films; many award-winning movies are slow, and even Star Wars films are slow. However, there is a purpose to a movie having a slower pacing if there is something that it is building up to. I did not feel that the information provided to us as the audience was valid enough for this movie to feel boring. To me, the main villain wasn't that interesting as a character, and the secondary villain was not villainous enough. The motives for the latter was a very generic corporate money-driven motive. At least Ghost, the main villain (not a spoiler, since she's featured in the trailers) has a reasoning for wanting what our heroes want. In fact, it is more of a need. Fortunately, slow pacing in the beginning of the movie is the last of the problems, as things just get better.First, I would like to recognize the great Paul Rudd for bringing a quirky and charming humor to his character of Ant-Man that makes him a unique MCU villain. He is certainly more entertaining than boring ol' Captain America, and I would definitely prefer his character over T'Challa (The Black Panther), who lacks interesting qualities. Along with Ant-Man himself, the rest of the main cast does a great job making this movie feel unique in its approach to generating laughs. It is more awkward, random, and situational humor that elaborates on it's random jokes until another character has to get everyone back on board. If you remember the first movie, you'll remember that Scott Lang's friend Luis (Michael Peña) has a fantastic way of retelling a story and how everything happened that led to the present moment in time. He uses this storytelling method once again, but this time it lasts longer and is even more humorous than before. For me, the comedy of the movie was its main draw for me to watch it again, just as it had been for the first film.What also sets apart Ant-Man and The Wasp from other Marvel movies was its different kind of action. Generally, action movies have the same kind of action that includes punches, explosions, and chases. Many MCU movies also have this kind of action. A few exceptions include the emphasis on hand-to-hand combat in Captain America films, spaceship-driven action in the Guardians of the Galaxy films (my favorite MCU series), and trippy wizardry in Doctor Strange. Ant-Man films have their own approach to action in that they constantly involve shrinking. It's so much fun to see regular real-world environments from a microscopic perspective. The chase scenes with vehicles turning small and regular sized, The Wasp's flight while using shrinking, and the Quantum Realm were delightful to watch. Its crazy that this movie's visuals were so much better than Black Panther visuals even when work with $38 million less (budget of $162 million compared to $200 million). No other action movie can boast action sequences as unique and fun as in the Ant-Man movies, and it is even better the second time.After watching the movie, I completely forgot about the generic plot and mostly uninteresting villains because I had a great time. The humor and action sequences along with Paul Rudd's great starring turn as our hero made this Marvel movie a great watch. Unfortunately, the plot and slow pacing in the beginning of the movie can't make this movie worth buying on Blu-Ray. However, it is certainly worth spending $12 for a theatre ticket and $2 for RedBox. Since Disney and Netflix have an agreement, it will eventually appear for streaming. When it does, I say make the most of its availability and watch it a few times.Overall, I would bestow Ant-Man and The Wasp a solid 8.25/10."
826,7,"Ant-Man Takes a Nap I'm still a bit unsure Ant-Man is a thing. My Marvel friends who absolutely hate DC have consistently told me, with a very serious and straight face, that not only is Ant-Man a thing, he and Dr. Hank Pym are really super-important to the entire Marvel Universe, and so are the Silver Surfer, Ultron, Captain Marvel, and Star Lord, despite me never having heard of them until Stan Lee became a bagillionbeedionaire. For those DC fans, I am still with you, patiently waiting for a Man-Bat movie, because we understand how important Man-Bat is to the DC Universe.Ant-Man and the Wasp like to get small, like sometimes really small, like Quantum World small. Ant-Man also likes to get big, like sometimes really big. In fact, Ant-Man sometimes gets so big he gets super-tired and has to take a power-nap at really inconvenient times. The Wasp does not seem to enjoy getting big, probably because of the nappiness of it all.Much like Downsizing, when things get small, they can bump and bash around without any reference to Newtonian physics, despite the theoretical foundations laid down so succinctly by Laurence Fishburne, who plays Dr. Bill Foster, who I am sure is somehow vitally part of the Marvel Universe, or at least part of it.It's possible to become quantumly entangled, and the side-effects include instability, pithiness, and the ability to spin multiple side-plots for no good reason. There are potential references to The Dead Pool (not Deadpool) and Innerspace, and many opportunities to laugh about house arrest.But when high-tech stuff fails, sometimes it's high-tech stuff and bawdy banter we need to save the day."
827,8,"Small in Size, Large in Fun Coming off the heals of the (current) 4th highest-grossing film of all-time, Ant-Man and the Wasp (AATW), much like its 2015 predecessor, following ""Age of Ultron"", is given the strenuous task of following up the MCU's biggest film to date. And again, like Ant-Man, it provides a wonderfully soft cushion to break the metaphorical fall of the MCU after it climbed to the very top and jumped with ""Infinity War"". It shows issues no doubt, but it's just the rebound of simple, lighthearted fun that was needed.And that's where it thrives most, in its accessible, while still unique entertainment value. The sequel does its job by building on the original, making room for fun, varied action sequences, driven by the unique powers of our titular characters, doubled by the addition of Wasp (Evangeline Lilly). Director Peyton Reed really played around with the shrinking and growing powers of both Ant-Man and the Wasp, crafting some super fun ""now you see me, now you don't"" action. The CGI has the look and detail of an Avengers-level film, coupled with eye-catching costume design and artistic direction, it supplements the film's action nicely. AATW also provides some of the best comedy in the MCU. There's hilarious scenes that kept the mood light and my smile brimming, as Reed utilizes forms of slapstick comedy with Ant-Man's powers and an often-malfunctioning suit to create some of the funniest moments in the entire franchise.This sequel proves again that not every superhero film has to have life and death implications, that there are great small stories to be told, especially inside Marvel's connected universe. That's just what Reed aims for and largely succeeds in with its narrative; smaller in scale, more personalized and easy to digest. It's at heart a character-driven MacGuffin story surrounding genius Hank Pym's (Michael Douglas) homemade lab, as a trifecta of groups, including our heroes, aim to get their hands on it for their own personal reasons. Set to a beat of classic Marvel-comedic tones along with a pinch of sci-fi elements, we have a smaller, easy-to-grasp plot while still delivering on intrigue. And while it's not huge in scope, Reed and his writing team find clever ways to connect the story to the larger MCU, while still staying self-contained, not resorting to a world-ending plot line. We get to see expanded usage of the Quantum Realm, a subplot which lends an extra mysterious sci-fi element, an aspect much welcomed into the film and something we haven't seen the last of for sure. Lead character Scott Lang/Ant-Man's (Paul Rudd) decision to aid Captain America during ""Civil War"" left an enormous impact on his personal life and the lives of others. I love how the outcome of that film is still having a trickle-down effect on the main characters, that we're seeing those stories being told (i.e. Black Panther, Homecoming).On the flip side of its story, AATW does show its occasional flaws. The Marvel template of filmmaking has been vastly expanded on in the past couple of years, taking a tried-and-true formula and molding it into new genres and adventures. This film is structurally the safest we've seen since ""Doctor Strange"", maybe since the first ""Ant-Man"". A structure that often benefits the film, as it does with nearly all MCU outings, but at times the weariness of the ""original"" Marvel formula can be seen here, playing many story elements safer. The film gets off to a rather slow start, there's a lack of action and pacing in the first act that puts a damper on the flow for a while. As good as the characters are (more on that soon), the plot creates a redundancy to both sides coinciding together, who seemingly could easily set aside their differences to help each other, but the story demands they remain enemies to include the cat-and-mouse chase to continue the story. Small mishaps no doubt, but like Ant-Man himself, sometimes the smallest things stand out the most.Character development has been a staple of the MCU ever since it kicked of in 2008. We get some awesome recurring characters with equally as wonderful acting performances. There's tight chemistry that binds it all together, creating likable characters to root for. Leading the charge is Paul Rudd, whose charisma, charm and terrific humor shines through in his third outing as Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly gets a hefty increase of screen time here and rightfully so. Her character development is well-fit and Lilly gives a solid performance as Hope van Dyne/Wasp. Veteran Michael Douglas, like in the first film, delivers another great act; he's taken the great writing of Hank Pym and ran with it, displaying excellent emotion and wonderfully witty humor. The supporting cast is rounded out nicely with the solid addition of Laurence Fishburne as Hank Pym's former colleague, Bill Foster, who's involvement deepens the lore and the story at hand. But the supporting cast's icing on the cake is Michael Pena (Luis), who again steals the show with his fast-talking humor and hilarious flashback narration scenes.We've witnessed the recent eradication of Marvel's so-called ""villain problem"" (Vulture, Hela, Killmonger, Thanos) and while AATW doesn't necessarily present of villain ""problem"", the main marketed villain, Ghost, is easily the weakest we've seen in a while. It's almost hard to call her a villain. That title more appropriately is held by black-arms dealer Sonny Burch (Walter Goggins), a fairly bland and unoriginal antagonist himself. Ghost, even with her cool powers and desperate motives, wasn't compelling enough to become emotionally attachable. Her background story just isn't gripping, and there's no reason to care about her motives. I enjoyed that it wasn't about the threat of our heroes being killed by Ghost, and that wasn't ever the intent with her the character, but her presence doesn't invoke enough urgency to take that step into becoming a legitimate villain. Adding salt to the wound, actress Hannah John-Kamen's debut in the MCU as Ghost was disappointing. Not enough emotional complexity from her performance bogs down the character into becoming that less-interesting character, which is also due in part to lackluster writing.There's a simplistic ideology to AATW that makes it, at time, seem slightly ""cookie cutter"". But Reed and Marvel doesn't let the sequel fall to the wayside by injecting lively personality into the film. Big (yet so small), unique action sequences, laugh-out-loud comedy and a cast of lovable, fleshed out protagonists. It's not too big nor too small; Ant-Man and the Wasp is a splendid, snugly fit inside the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe.8/10"
828,9,"Ant-Man 2 (oh...and there's a chick in it...) I left this movie feeling like I'd just seen Star Wars for the first time. What Marvel and Disney (or at least the people they hire) have managed to do here is finally capture a single issue of a comic book from the 70s in movie form.Just like a child's first comic picked off the corner store spinner rack, this movie has all of the information a first time viewer (nee reader) would need to understand all of the character motivations and story developments. It's only problem is that the story and dialog is buried beneath so much entertaining action that it can be difficult (due to constant distraction) to follow the complexity of the expertly crafted presentation.I would put this in the octagon with Thor:Ragnarok, The Incredible Hulk, and Spider-Man:Homecoming to duke it out for the number one Marvel movie. I think Hulk would still come out on top, but this is a great contender. Your mileage may vary."
829,5,"Ehh it was okay..I wouldn't rush to the movies to see it It was funny but the humor did not save it from being kinda pointless and the ""villains"" were lackluster . The Marvel universe would've been completely okay if this sequel didn't exist. It seems that Marvel just keeps spitting out movies just so they can say they've had a movie for every Avenger. They need to focus on quality and not quantity."
830,7,"Good movie for what it is. This movie is a good filler movie between infinity war and captain marvel. It was a fun movie that didn't try too hard to be anything bigger than what it was.There are a few negatives. Certain plot details in the film happen towards the end that are not explain and are just meant to be accepted.Overall this movie was fun and entertaining, nothing more. 7/10."
831,2,"Finding mommy OK the movie was like finding nemo but with humans.When i entered the movie i was shocked about the aim of the movie was just finding her mama.I wanted some answers about where was Ant-Man during infinity war events OK i got answer (only in the credit scene) but i didn't get a movie.Poor story,weak characters,weak story and obivously some jokes most were bad I laughed some times but sometimes I felt like that is silly it wasn't strange that the man beside me slept during the movie i also felt asleep but I waited for something good may happen but nothing happened I really don't think that I want to re watch it again even in thousands years certainly there are people who enjoyed it but I didn't"
832,6,"So Close... Unfortunately, Marvel just can't get away from trying to do things epic and so AMATW isn't the brisk light fun ride it should be. It's a 2 hour film which while pretty well done, feels its length. Ironically, they really just needed to compress it, shrink it down, and it would have been more than just a run of the mill film."
833,6,"Edgar Wright's Loss is Keenly Felt The film just seems so tone deaf. Losing Edgar Wright off the film was a huge blow and a great example of why cinephiles follow directors and writers more than actors. Paul Rudd is a funny guy and a decent lead but when he isn't being written for and directed by a person with as much talent as him, he's just stuck in a middle-ing movie, delivering middle-ing lines.In the end, ""Ant Man"" seems more like the sort of film Edgar Wright would normally make fun of, not write."
834,9,Worth seeing! I didn't care that much for the first one which was kind of slow and uneventful. I was surprised how good this one turned out. It was funny and had a great story.
835,6,"Decent Movie Overall it was a decent movie, as no movie can be without mistakes. I thought it was a funny movie that helped show the world what ant man was doing after Civil War and why he wasn't able to show up in Infinity War. Now here comes the stuff I felt was not good... some scenes left me bored which never happens to me with marvel movies, I felt that the movie was dragging on at one occasion. The villain was subpar and really had no good reason to be conflicting with the heroes as Hope said her mother may be able to help Ghost. Alright that was my review, also I will probably watch it again for fun."
836,7,It was a good movie to watch Ant-Man and the Wasp was a good movie and did a lot of things well. The comedy in the movie was good most of the time and made the movie enjoyable to watch. The chemistry thst the characters had was good too. Also the movie did a good job connecting the events of Civil War to this movie as well.
837,7,Go see it on the Big Screen Its a big screen movie and will not translate to tv...and its funny where it needs to be and doesnt take itself seriously...its a comic book movie folks ....and its a good one worth the 30 bucks for ticks and adult beverage to see it...lots of people worked hard to make a super hero movie and their effort shows...but its a comic movie...not shakespeare...michelle pfiifer is still hot hot hot ...its a comic book movie...love the streets of san francisco homage...totally fun ....its a comic book movie not shindlers list....no awards needed just a break from reality....and it delivers that
838,8,"Marvel is still on a roll Ant man and wasp did not disappoint and survive the disappointment that normally accompanies a sequel. Paul Rudd's portrayal of Scott Lang stood out again in the Ant man franchise.When it comes to casting, hats off to marvel.Evangeline Lily did her part as the butt kicking partner(Brains and arguablly the brawns of the occupation too).Without giving away too much i would like to say that i didn't like the second end credit scene, well, that's just my opinion.Overall a good sentimental yet funny till you snort your drink out of your nose kind of movie with a convenient ending but well connected to the entire Marvel cinematic universeHow i decided my rating: Evangeline Lily - 0.8 Paul Rudd - 0.9 Comedy - 1.0 Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeifer - 0.7 Supporting cast - 0.8 (Abby Ryder, Laurence Fishburne, Randall Park and David Dastmalchian and T.I.) Michael Pena - 0.8 Hannah John-Kamen and Walton Goggins - 0.6 Graphics - 0.8 Romance/Family Sentiments - 0.6 Story and screenplay - 0.8 Total - 7.8"
839,7,"Quantum Leap! 7 years ago, long before Marvel movies expanded into the cinematic universe it is today, I went to film camp. Naturally, we were all given nicknames to remember each other more clearly. I became ""Ant-Man"". It stuck. So much so that one morning when I came in, one of the TA's slyly dropped a handful of computer print-outs on my desk of pictures of Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Ant-Man, more than even I realize, has been a staple of my identity ever since.So when Marvel announced a cinematic treatment of Ant-Man in 2015, how could I resist. Casting comedy legend Paul Rudd was a gamble worth shooting for. Even if it fell flat, it would have been a bomb as memorable as Ryan Reynolds's Green Lantern. Luckily, Ant-Man was an inventive, clever, funny and entertaining hit. Easily the most carefree film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp is completely in spirit of it's predecessor. But as with all sequels, it's shortcomings are noticeable.Is it as fresh and surprising as it was the first time around? Of course not. The mystique of the shrinking and growing super-suit of Scott Lang is already developed, and unfortunately, not really expanded here. The amount of things you could do with shrinking and growing objects leave the imagination in a whirlwind, but it seems that was too much to gamble on for the filmmakers. This is a real play-it-safe movie. When it hits, its irresistible, but it doesn't always. What we do get is a sentimental story about family that packs more of a punch here than certainly the last one was capable of. I'll admit, I was fascinated by the Quantum leaps and bounds this film took in the search for Hope's long lost mother. Everything else is popcorn fun, if nothing else. Even Michael Pena's running joke from the last film returns, and luckily, they utilized it in the way they should have. Not overdone and overblown, and even at the same time, laugh-out-loud funny. I guess playing it safe has it's upsides after all."
840,4,"Who wins? The question I continued to asked myself during this movie was would I rather be watching a Fort Wayne Mad Ants (NBA G-League) game right now or be watching this movie, Ant-Man and the Wasp? While the producing and movie quality was top notch, this movie lacked suspense, comedy, and action. So, when it came down to it the answer to my question was easy. Although the G-Leaguers lack the superior qualities of the NBA superstars, the Ant-Man and the Wasp was like watching the backup movies of Marvel."
841,5,Lighthearted Marvel Movie is carried by Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly's performances Acting- 10/10 Script/Writing-8/10 Special Effects-9/10 Characters and Character Development-8/10 Plot-6/10 Cinematography-6/10Overall- 7.8/10
842,7,Enjoyable Was really looking forward to this movie since infinity war and I was hopping for a little more but neither the less was a good marvel movie. I think Ant-man is a wicked character and is going to play a bigger role in avengers 4 with the mid credit scenes teaser this. Marvel can never disappoint me
843,8,"Cool Marvel Movie ! Will be short here (no pun intended) by saying this movie is a breeze for many reasons: we sympathize with this hero despite his condition (housewatch due to his activities with ""Civil War""), the Wasp which is quite a bad-ass and of course Michael Douglas, whom in my book steals the show as Hank Pym the original Ant-Man. And great to see Michelle Pfeiffer again, even if it's for a short time in the movie, far from her incredible portrayal of Catwoman way back...Well written, lots of twists and humor here. Should be the way a Marvel cinematic universe movie should be. (and maybe Lucasfilm should take lessons from there, since these are both divisions of Disney, and remembering the flop of ""Solo""...)And again, for a few seconds, Stan Lee steals the show...Sad we had to wait in March 2019 for more adventures featuring another ""Marvel"" girl... and yes she will bear the latter name !"
844,7,"No spoiling review I gave the movie 7/10 , i think the movie is good , not as good as the first one But if you big fan of marvel world you should watch it I highly recommend it"
845,9,Just loved it. Jockes and story as good as the first Ant man movie. Great sequel and finally will understand how Infinity War and Ant man and the wasp correlate.
846,7,"Big fun comes in small packages In a genre where cities are routinely flattened and the world often hangs in the balance, it's refreshing to have a scale that is more intimate and where the stakes are more personal. Like the first Ant-Man, AM&TW is an action-comedy, not merely an action film w/some humor. That humorous component serves it well and never undermines the drama.Despite mounds and mounds of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook, the basic story (and that basic story is basic) is solid and serves as a capable vessel for the action and humor, both of which land w/an impressive consistency. The MVP is of course Paul Rudd, who is effortlessly likeable once again in the title role. The cast around him all, ahem, rise to the occasion, and the result is a fun bit of cinematic sorbet to cleanse our pallet after the heavy full course meal that was Infinity War."
847,10,Better than expected Right combination of action and humor. Was expected a middle grade hero to be not a great movie but I was proven wrong. Two after credit scenes.
848,6,"Above average sequel Really tried to like this but it was lacking. Had some funny moments but not as funny as original which caught us by surprise. Interesting script and completely out of relation to comic storyline but hey, it's for entertainment, not history, lol.Not sure how Marvel will keep this going as a series but definitely hope they don't keep trying to integrate them into Avengers, sigh..."
849,10,"Extremely entertaining movie The original was good, but the sequel is better. Very entertaining, and it connects right into the current story lines. Can't wait to see whats next!"
850,9,"My kind of superhero movie This was a fun movie. At the time I write this, it is my number 2 movie for the year after ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"". I like fun movies. It ties in (at the very end) with ""Avengers: Infinity War"", yet isn't really about that. I see nothing other than some light fantasy violence that need worry parents. The plot is a bit contrived, but no more than any comic-based movie. It is certainly not predictable, other than we know the good guys will win in the end. There are two main sets of villains, one bad, one not so bad. They give a good sense of urgency and importance to the efforts of our heroes without getting oppressive with it. The effects were superb. The acting was great. The dialog was sprinkled with just the right amount of humor, and the movie didn't take itself too seriously. Most importantly, the movie was paced just right. You won't get bored, nor will you get left behind."
851,8,"Escapist Entertainment My wife had knee surgery about 10 days ago and I was burned out by home care so we agreed that some R&R was called for. Went to the local AMC to sit with ANTMAN and ..... wonderful. Many years ago I saw the 3rd Indiana Jones to take my mind of job troubles and this Marvel entry does exactly the same. It is what a movie SHOULD be. Not heavy like INIFINITY WARS are stupid serious like most of the DC films. Nor long either. Yes slow at the start, but once this picks up speed it never lets up. Cast is all first rate. And the multiple plot threads are well managed and kept separate to keep the story alive. Always CGI of course but we live in a new world now. Stay for the end credit scenes too. If you have worries and want an ant to remove them for a spell ... take a ride on this wasp for a trip."
852,10,"Equally has good as the first film. I liked the first Ant Man film, it was a fun light on it's feet superhero film, Paul Rudd gave a funny likable performance, plays off of Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly perfectly, and Michael Pena stole some scenes.Follows the events after Captain America - Civil War, Scott Lang has under house arrest, but after a dream about Janet Pym will have him team up with Hank and Hope again, Hope is now the superhero known has The Wasp, Scott will have to don the Ant Man suit again.Every bit has fun as the first film, if you are tired of the intense drama of Infinity war, then this movie is for you. Rudd gives the same likable performance, Evangeline lilly really this time has The Wasp, and she and Rudd have great chemistry. Michael Douglas is also good, so was the scene stealer Michael Pena. The shrinking and growing effects are quite awesome.And the mid credits are a promo for the next marvel film/"
853,9,"Way more entertaining than the stupid Infinity War I prefer this to the bloated, overly convoluted, exhausting Infinity War... much more fun and lighter affair with plenty of actions and laughs... Well worth the money and time..."
854,9,"Scale matters In one of the sweetest scenes in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", Ant-Man's human persona Scott, played by kind resilient Paul Rudd, sits legs crossed on the bedroom floor with his 10 year-old daughter Cassie, played by cute innocent Hannah John-Kamen. Scott is so sorry for making a mess in his heroic circumstance. Cassie says, ""It's not dumb to help people.""For Director Peyton Reed's sequel ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" scale truly does matter. In the story by the mini-army of Writers Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari, our Superheroes Ant-Man and Wasp, played by Evangeline Lilly, are not out to save the world, much less the Universe like other Marvel Movies.The scale matters. ""Ant-Man and Wasp"" is smaller, less noisy. There's no threat of global Armageddon. There are spectacular chase scenes in San Francisco with ""Goliath"" Ant-Man, and cinematic kaleidoscope tunneling into the Quantum Realm.Instead the captivating thread is Hope Van Dyne, played by beautiful strong Evangeline, risking her life to find her long lost Mother Janet, played by radiant wise Michelle Pfeiffer, in the Quantum Realm. Paul's Scott, who returned from the Quantum Realm in ""Ant-Man"" holds the key to that possible resurrection.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" revels in its quirk, not so much in the ostentatious CGI expanding and shrinking effect. Although, the cool martial arts fight scenes with Wasp and new adversary, the phasing Ghost, played by tortured charismatic Hannah John-Kamen, is high impact awesome.Scott unintentionally channels Janet, gifting clues about her location. Scott as Janet holds the hand of her Husband Hank Pym, creator of Ant-Man and Wasp, played by whimsical Michael Douglas. The look on Hank's face is hysterical. As Scott gently caresses Janet's daughter Hope's face, that's the Mother's love. Rudd, Lilly, and Douglas brilliantly play light-hearted, yet never forget that what matters is family. Michelle is sublime gravitas. Too bad the story didn't call for more screen time.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" begins with Scott under house arrest after his heroics with The Avengers in ""Captain America: Civil War"". This also explains his disappearance in ""Infinity War"". He has nightmares of his stint in the ubiquitous Quantum Realm, while sharing custody of his daughter Cassie. Because of his Avengers debacle as Ant-Man, Scott's now estranged from Hank and his daughter Hope. That's until Hope discovers Scott's possible link to her Mother. Scott and Hope are in love with each other, but not always in phase. So to speak.In this needlessly convoluted narrative, Scott joins forces with Hank and Hope to retrieve Janet. Powerful assassin Eva, also called Ghost, arises threatening their mission. Eva suffers excruciating pain: Her molecules continual regenerate in her phasing curse. Her cure may also resolve in that Quantum Realm.The imaginative movie action dazzles along with the visual effects. Really, it is the personal scale of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" that resonates. The young woman wants to find her beloved Mother. The husband wants to be with the love of his life. The young daughter believes in her Dad reminding him, ""You can do anything."" ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is fun exhilarating Summer fare that's also about family and those close. After all: It's not dumb to help people."
855,7,"Full of light hearted fun! In the lead up to the release of Ant Man & The Wasp I was a little unfazed by its impending release with it being so close after the massive explosion that was Avengers: Infinity War in April. The trailers for the sequel seemed ""run of the mill"" and didn't really grab me that much and while I thoroughly enjoyed Ant-Man on release, I hadn't actually viewed it since it's home release all that time ago.I arrived at the cinema last night for my advanced screening tired and not particularly excited after bad traffic on the way which almost made me consider just going home and catching it another night. I am glad I didn't just go home because this was actually a really fun time and surprised the hell out of me. As other viewers have noted, Ant Man & The Wasp provides a nice upbeat fun time which is great after the tone of Infinity War.Ant Man & The Wasp thankfully does not follow the main ""solo"" story structure of most of the earlier Marvel movies by not having a clear cut villain which is great.Very Slight Spoilers AheadThe main plot of the film revolves around the search for Hope's mother played by Michelle Pfeiffer who has been lost in the Quantum realm for 30 odd years.The film looks great for the most part and the returning supporting cast are fantastic as they were in the original with Michael Pena having a particularly great scene that everyone in the theatre was hoping for at about the halfway mark.It is worth noting that as with the original film, we open to a flashback of sorts using de-ageing Visual Effects trickery on both Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, let me just say that this is the absolute best success of this technology i have ever seen. I was trying so very hard to pick it apart and while Douglas' looked a tiny bit ""uncanny valley"" I could not for the life of me pick out anything wrong about de-aged Pfeiffer, it was that good I could have been watching a newly scanned film print from the 80s.The only thing that lacked for me was the film's soundtrack felt as if it could have been a little punchier, for instance in the final act car chase sequence the soundtrack felt like it was ramping up to something but never did.Acting wise the whole cast did a great job including a smaller side character played by Randall Park who had some fun little scenes which really added to the film.Ant Man & The Wasp succeeds as a lighthearted breath of fresh air with well executed comedy and a hell of a fun time.Thanks to Event Cinemas Marion for providing the advanced screening for this review,"
856,9,"The Way Back Where Infinity War brought the heavy stuff, marking a demonstrable shift in overall tone in the MCU, Ant Man dialed things back to the way things were beforehand; danger, intrigue and levity all blended together to create a fun experience.Scott Lang's absence from the Infinity War was explained in an offhand comment, and given where we pick things up, we can get a sense of its placement in the overall timeline, giving us the first real jump backwards in the MCU's generally linear timeline. This jump is important, of course, as when we fade in, we are as yet unaware of how and when the Thanos effect will take place relevant to the plot.The MCU has been trending to making more of its villains less of the unambiguously evil type, instead giving them more complex motivations and even giving them a little bit of conflicted shine that could lead into a redemption arc...should they survive. Ghost is one of those such villains, as she is given more screen time to build on her motivations, and get them beyond what may initially appear black and white.The chemistry with the good guys in the film is really a top highlight. Rudd, Lilly, and Douglas play off of each other well, and it's easy to see why Michael Douglas continues to have enthusiasm for the role of Hank Pym. And the X-Con crew is again a fun bonus inclusion, and each of their scenes is good for a few laughs.The thing that makes this movie work is that the comedy and heart of it are so well intertwined. Scott's struggles are played out in layers, while giving him ample time to show that things haven't gone all bad since Germany. As such, he remains an interesting and amusing character, and hopefully he and Lilly, who is a dynamo with a great handle on how to break through the MCU's superheroine glass ceiling, will be teaming up in more films to come."
857,7,"Good not Great I personally loved this movie. But at the same time I went into it with a low expectation. Thought it wouldn't take itself too seriously so I knew what to expect.With that being said, if you go in for a good time you'll have a great time. As I did. Unless you go in thinking Infinity War 1.5 then you'll be disappointed. It's its own movie."
858,8,Tremendous follow up Could not have been more pleased. Great timing for some levity in the MCU.
859,3,"Flat. So I think I can officially say it this time:This is the first Marvel film I can undoubtedly say I thought was bad. VERY bad, as a matter of fact.Let's start from the beginning; I enjoyed the first 'Ant-Man' film. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. It reeks of re-writes and five different people working on its script. That said, it's imaginative and fun and I can at least roll with it and find it amusing at its worst lows and creative at its highest highs.But this...this...this just felt like it was there to just be 'there'.The characters: Paul Rudd is Paul Rudd. That may sound like a joke, but in all honesty, I have trouble finding a character in Scott Lang beyond ""Paul Rudd"". His character lacks any real depth, and I find it a struggle to truly care for him by the end of this film or even grasp onto a new development of his character that resulted in his film. He gives off the AIR of being likeable, and I DO like Paul Rudd's performance in this, but other than that...he's an actor playing himself. I don't see ""Scott Lang"". I see ""Paul Rudd"".Michael Douglas? Again, I LOVE Michael Douglas as an actor, but...he spouts technobabble, we're left confused as to what it all means, and we end up just seeing Hank Pymm as a dispensary of science talk and lacking a character. This entire film is about him and his quest to find his wife...yet we never get anything intimate for his character beyond a scene or two (Which are played for laughs anyway, so who cares?).Evangeline Lily and Michelle Pfeiffer, however, suffer the most here. Never have I seen such flat female characters in a superhero film since the mid-2000's of half-baked Marvel adaptation films. Hope Van Dyne is positioned as such a vital character in this film (Her character's name is IN THE TITLE), yet she feels completely jammed into a ""Badass girl who kicks you"" stereotype with little-to-no depth. For a character who we were ""promised"" would be vital to this film, I know very little about her beyond what I already knew from the first film.Pfeiffer suffers just as much, as she too is treated as only the role of ""Woman who must be rescued"". We get no development of her character as they search for her, no characterization, no scene that at least gives us an idea of what she was like or what she did.But what development we DO get is expressed through some truly awful sequences where the events of the first film are needlessly recapped, character backstories are flipped through and swatted-away just so the writers can say they included it, and take away any and all depth that could be explored with these characters.Instead, everything is FLAT. And I think that word describes this film perfectly. ""Flat"".""Flat"" is what the characters are. ""Flat"" is the cinematography and lighting of the film that looks like any other cut-and-dry comedy film with no inventiveness or seeming effort to make this look creative.And ""Flat"" is how the humor of this screenplay falls. For the thousands of swings this film takes at humor, it lands it about 20 times, and misses all the rest. The theater I was in was awkwardly quiet, simply because it was trying TOO HARD to be funny. The wit of the first film worked far better in that it didn't need to TRY to be funny.Instead, we have Michael Pena and Paul Rudd's heist friends rambling in scenes that feel improved and landing no jokes whatsoever. Other than a few scenes that were indeed humorous and garnered a big laugh or two from the audience and myself...clearly, the audience wasn't feeling it.And neither was I.In addition, the editing for this film incited a rare reaction of mine where I felt total whiplash in a jump from one scene to another. Quite literally, one transition from a scene to another was the most jarring and disjointed thing I've ever seen, and it left myself and my girlfriend audibly asking ourselves in our theatre seats if we just missed an entire scene. Not good at all.All that considered...I didn't absolutely hate every aspect of this film. The action scenes where they play with size are still mildly interesting, although even they can't save this film as they lack the ambition and creativeness that the first had. Paul Rudd is entertaining enough as...Paul Rudd, and even a few scenes involving Michael Pena and his friends elicit a chuckle or two.That said...I can't help but feel this film is an utter mess. A mess of mediocrity, poor editing, poor character writing, 2-3 action scenes that are nothing beyond ""Serviceable"", and attempts at humor that throws the entire buffet at you...but in the end, you only end up with empty calories.And that's how I feel about this film. Empty....+1 whole point for that Tim Heidecker cameo, though..."
860,9,Perfect It was perfect movie to follow infinity war. It shows the different dimensions and characters within the MCU. I love how it shows how much Scott Lang actually risked in Civil War and how he needs to recover and rebuild relationships. It gives a real sense of family and that anything can be brought back.
861,7,"Still very good, but Ant man was best in Civil war I enjoyed the first movie, mostly for it's humor. Micheal Pena especially is great in the original and this one. Paul Rudd is also good, and so is Evangeline Lily, with her much larger role here. A pretty good villain(s) and continuation from the first story make this at least as good as the first. My main gripe is that a lot of the fun bits were shown already in previews. I would have liked more surprises, but I guess it's my fault for watching trailers."
862,7,"Style Great, Substance Blah Ant-Man is Marvels comedic outlet. Although they are stretching it into other films, Ant-Man from the beginning started as a joke of a super hero and they have stuck by his side ever since. In this movie as the sequel coming off of Avenger: Infinity War, it was really here just to connect the dots. Not that it wasn't necessary, but really it could not exist and not much would change. They would just not have the extra billion dollars it will surely make. As far as the plot of the film is concerned it was a very average movie. I mean sure it had the nice Ant-Man flare of things growing larger and smaller, but for the most part it just passed by. Filling in the holes, but not making any new mountains or valleys. However, as the comedic outlet of Marvel, it was a gold mine! Paul Rudd and Michael Pena as two of the leads will lend any movie into a comedic success. As well as adding in the writers of Chris Mckenna and Erik Sommers, and that is a talented group. The lines were clever, they tied in very well from the first Ant-Man and they were delivered exceptionally. Ant-Man and the Wasp definitely needed something for it to be remembered by and for this movie it will be a random one-liner here and there, definitely not one of the best Marvel has to offer, but one that will give you a pretty good laugh."
863,8,"Meet expectations Meet my expectations of the movie being funny , aside that. Just like the first one with a great end credit clip"
864,3,Just to dumb to watch To stupid to be any entertaining...You would be better off spending your money on another movie.
865,9,Loved it. Loved the comedy and action 2 thumbs up. Lily and rud were awesome. Always good to see veteran Michael douglas. Michael Pena was halirious
866,10,Really great film. I very much enjoyed this movie. It was a great edition to the marvel universe. I enjoyed the cgi and the entire flow of the movie. I like Ghost as a character and I think it was a well done well put together movie. Another thing I enjoyed was the comedy.
867,8,Good But Not Great The movie had some cool action scenes but the story was mediocre. It feels like Disney is just trying to make its own version of Fox's Deadpool.
868,10,"Totally baffled at the hate.. Not sure why Antman always seems to get a bad rap. It's as funny as Deadpool and as action-packed as any other comic-themed movie. Paul Rudd is that lucky actor that never seems to age and he is just as funny ever, and fits this role perfectly. Ant-man and the Wasp is better than the first. I was iffy about Avengeline L. in this one but she was perfect. The CGI effects were on point, as well as the crash scenes, driving scenes etc. It's very hard to get that effect of being small and making it look real but they did it. Great storyline and acting all around. I'm not sure why the bad reviews. Trolls maybe? Make sure to see it, and don't let the few mad reviews sway your decision. My advice is also to see this in 3D"
869,10,"Fun Adventure, Connected to last Avengers story It was fun to watch, just like the first one. Can't wait for the next Avengers! Even if you are not a fan of Ant-man I think you should watch it to better understand what will happen with Thanos-deleted folks. :DP.S. It has 2 post credit scenes!"
870,7,"Highly enjoyable and entertaining In almost every aspect Ant man and the Wasp exceeds its predecessor in one of the MCU's funniest properties. Ant man and the Wasp was a fun, blockbuster comedy that knew what it was and understood its place as a very fun, well acted and well scripted comedy. From this perspective it couldn't have been made any better, the dialogues and quips were funny and fast paced, they hit all the marks that people wanted to revisit, introduced new ideas and characters and had amazing action and visuals.There wasn't anything significantly deep or thought provoking about Ant man and the Wasp but that is perfectly fine in the movie's own rights, not every single Marvel movie has to address a serious world ending crisis or explore political and racial issues. And that really is what's so great about the MCU in its current state, the diversity in their product, they can range from small scale heist/comedies to the most epic of battles but be equally as entertaining and great films.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles as Scott Lang and Hope Van dyne respectively, coming back better than ever. The new role for Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp adds a much needed female badassery to this franchise and very much elevates the action and intercharacter relationships. Paul Rudd further proves why he is one of the most likeable actors by utilizing his charms and the father-daughter relationship to build a more well rounded and well liked lead. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer were both very good in their roles adding a layer of intrigue and interest to the MCU, creating more questions about the superheroes before the Avengers came about.Overall I was very impressed with how Ant man and the Wasp manages to exceed Ant man and what a great and enjoyable time this movie was."
871,9,"Short Sweet, Higher Ground, and helps shed the Infinity War shadow Good Fun. Based in SF and not New York is always a great change. This film is short but doesn't seem like it. It is clear, introduces characters from comic canon, brings back Janet, drops a hint as to how Scott Lang can go find Tony Stark to fulfill Dr. Strange knowing that Stark had to live to fix things later. Worth seeing if you enjoy Paul Rudd or Evangaline Lilly, or if you are following the MCU, or if you need help reclaiming some ""Hope"" for Avengers 4. Look up Kyle Hill's youtube Because Science video on why Ant-Man might be the most powerful hero which includes explaining Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Tunneling and World Lines along with ""Time Vortex"" are important. Worth seeing at least twice pay close attention to the comic book canon references and the Quantum information as it relates to traveling."
872,8,"Welcome back Michelle Pfeiffer, it has been too long. After the emotional carnage of INFINITY WAR, the MCU needed to allow us fans to catch our breath and decompress, and ANT MAN AND THE WASP allows us to do just that in a movie that is essentially a partial sequel to CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. It takes part in that corner of the MCU occupied by Scott Laing, whom we last saw fighting alongside Cap at the Berlin Airport in what might still be my favorite scene in any Marvel movie to date. Missing from that throw down was any mention of Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne, the father and daughter duo who came up with the technology that allowed Scott to become Ant Man in the first place. In the opening act A & W, which has a lot of set up and catching up, we learn just what everyone has been up to and why Scott was MIA in INFINITY WAR.The plot of ANT MAN AND THE WASP turns on a dangling plot thread from the first Ant Man film, mainly the possibility that Hank's wife and Hope's mother, Janet, is still alive in the Quantum Realm (a microverse below the subatomic level), having been presumed lost there many years earlier during a mission with her husband. The three main protagonists, who have become estranged after the events of CIVIL WAR, are now forced by events to reunite on a mission to rescue Janet, but they are soon being pursued by two different sets of villains with two very different agendas with the common goal of obtaining Pym's technology for their own use. Then there is the FBI, which has had Scott under house arrest, making any involvement by him in any of Pym's plans very problematic. This sets up a very straight forward narrative, where the heroes have to break into and break out of various tight spots, getting captured at least once along the way, not to mention a number of chase sequences and fight scenes where the CGI gets to shine. This leads to a finale where everything is on the line and multiple characters are in serious peril, both in this world and the Quantum Realm; pretty much your typical Marvel movie.And that is just fine, as this installment of the MCU keeps the stakes small, sometimes literally, as the world is never in danger, and there is no super Big Bad out to rule or ruin. There is a lot of easy going humor that rises out of character and situation - many laughs are had at the expense of Scott's problems with his malfunctioning Ant Man suit, leaving him the size of child or a giant at inopportune times. There is the welcome return of Michael Pena as Scott's ex-con partner in a new security business; Pena takes a part that could have been nothing more than comic relief and does something so much more with it. The action scenes, especially the chases through the streets of San Francisco, are a true highlight as the laws so physics are thrown out the window while speeding vehicles go from normal size to matchbox and back again. This is one of those times where they don't try to overwhelm us with CGI, unlike INFINITY WAR and DOCTOR STRANGE where you can clearly see where actors spent all day going through their motions in front of a green screen. If the super sized ants are less than realistic, the producers clearly let us know it is all right with a wink to the audience by having a certain sci fi classic from the 50's be conveniently playing on a TV set in one scene.If I do have a complaint, it is that A & W lacks a strong villain, as it would have been a great opportunity to showcase Marvel's ample rogue's gallery. But The Ghost (played by Hannah John-Kamen), a former assassin for SHIELD who can phase through solid matter, is given a strong motive for her actions, one directly linked to Hank Pym's past, which allows the audience to empathize with her. The other villain, a technology thief, is played by Walton Groggins with oily Southern charm, who is more comical than threatening, which is okay, but if you are a Goggins fan, then you know he is capable of so much more.But the rest of the actors are perfectly cast, starting with the returning Paul Rudd as Scott Laing, a part that allows one of the most charming actors in the business to do what he does best, and in Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne, he gets a partner to expertly play off of in their best scenes. Old pro Michael Douglas returns as Hank Pym, one of the essential characters of the Marvel Universe and in The Avengers history. What is so great in this installment is that Douglas's Hank is paired with Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Janet, another great Marvel legacy character. Last year saw the return of Michael Keaton to comic book movies in SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING; and it is fitting that this summer sees the best Catwoman ever follow in the steps of the best Batman of them all. Welcome back Michelle Pfeiffer, it has been too long. Speaking of welcome, Laurence Fishbourne turns up as Bill Foster, the Giant Man of that great run of Avengers comics from the 80's. Randall Park is FBI agent Jimmy Woo, another longtime Marvel character, my only problem is that Park plays him for laughs, a departure from the Jimmy Woo of the comic books.One of the continuing themes that many might not pick up on is the relationship between fathers and daughters, and the unbreakable bond it forms, whether it is between Scott and his precocious Cassie, Hank and Hope, or the one between Bill Foster and Ava, aka The Ghost.Of course there is the requisite mid credit scene, and the elephant in the room when it starts is INFINTIY WAR and the consequences of Thanos's victory; suffice to say that this scene delivers on its promise and leaves Scott in a most precarious situation, one that may be resolved in the next Avengers film; I wonder if a throwaway line about time displacements in the Quantum Realm is a clue to how Scott might be rescued. I thought we might get a scene that also lets us know the fate of Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton as well, as he was also absent from INFINITY WAR, but the whereabouts of Hawkeye remains a mystery."
873,8,Really funny Marvel movie This movie was really awesome and it had a really good comedy the only thing that was making me not like it with a 10 out of 10 star rating is that it was very confusing
874,7,"Lots of fun. This movie was really good. It was better than the first Ant-Man movie, and I would recommend seeing it in a theater if you have the chance. Be warned, there are two end-credits scenes, so don't forget to stay all the way to the end.Overall, I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and its a nice addition to the MCU. Its not the most memorable movie, but I was entertained.Plot - Ironically this movie stays fairly small-scale, which is a good thing. There are mulitple villans and small conflicts and they all interact in a smooth and coherent way. Despite being just a minute longer than the first, the second movie moves along much faster due to better pacing and coherency. The plot doesn't get in the way of the jokes, and the jokes don't get in the way of the movie. Every set up has a spectacular payoff and pretty much every event in this movie has further relevancy making everything fit together and the world feel real. There were more than one instances where something would happen, I remembered the set-up from twenty minutes ago, and felt very satisfied.Characters - The actors are all great and are playing the same characters that we saw in the first movie. There aren't as many character arcs as there could've been, but this story takes place over a short amount of time and it doesn't matter too much. Not to say that characters don't learn anything, they do, its just not too drastic. Also, I would like to point out that the child actor that played Scott's kid was great. I wasn't looking forward to her scenes at first, but she was funny and did a good job. In the future I'll be pointing this movie as an example when arguing with idiots that child actors can be good as long as they have good direction despite being a child (take notes Wonder Woman, this is how its done).Sights and Sounds - The soundtrack and sound design were both pretty good for the most part. The effects were all really good as well as the cinematography. The action is all fantastic, and this is one of the few Marvel movies that doesn't end with two people with the same abilities fighting (like Iron Man, Hulk, Black Panther, Ant-Man, etc.).Extras - Stan Lee made a cameo in this movie (it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without him appearing) but he wasn't the only background character that made me laugh. I'd recommend keeping an eye on the background because some of the reactions of various characters to the main conflict are pretty funny. At one point during the car chase before the finale, you can see a woman in the background walking down a sidewalk. She's talking on her phone and you can see her turn her head to look at the giant Ant-Man sliding down the road, before turning back to continue walking wherever she was going and its just really funny. The people who were on the boat were also great along with every other extra.Theater Experience - I saw this movie in the theater. It was mostly full, and there was at least 10-20 little kids that looked to be under the age of ten. You know what else it was? Silent. It was one of the best movie theater experiences I've had in a while. If you are a parent, and you are bringing your children to the movie theater, please tell them to be quiet or leave. Being a little kid is no excuse to talk during a movie. Neither is being a fanboy (when I saw Avengers: Infinity War, the theater was so loud I could barely hear half the jokes and at one point someone stood up and started clapping and cheering just because Thor was onscreen again)."
875,7,"VIEWS ON FILM review of Ant-Man and the Wasp Yup, there's a connection between Ant-Man and the Wasp and Avengers: Infinity War. All you gotta do is check out the short clip after the closing credits come up. Marvel Comics, you just couldn't resist could you.Anyway, Ant-Man and the Wasp is overly plotted compared to first Ant-Man installment. Added to that, ""Wasp"" doesn't take itself as seriously, it's not a blueprint vehicle, and there's a little less at stake (Paul Rudd's Scott Lang isn't saving the world this time when he puts on that dwindling suit). Oh well. ""Wasp"" with its nod to the quantum realm gods, is a lot of fun and it turns your everyday superhero movie on its collective head. 2015's Ant-Man came off as an action comedy. Ant-Man and the Wasp is compulsory comedy with some jaunty action on the side.Before production commenced on ""Wasp"", director Peyton Reed managed to get every single cast member from the first Ant-Man to sign on. This time around, their personas are fleshed out even more as a result. Examples would be Michael Pena's kooky, ex-con named Luis, Scott Lang's twinkling, cutesy daughter (Cassie played by Abby Ryder Fortson), and of course Evangeline Lilly as the butt-kicking companion dubbed Wasp.""Wasp"", while totally worth the price of admission, sometimes revels too much in sci-fi mumbo jumbo, backstory convolution, and serpentine gadgetry. However, Peyton Reed still keeps things light and breezy with his whip pans, his techie-staged fistfights, and his collective wink wink to the audience.Reed, who I'll always think of as the antithetical Joss Whedon and the dude that filmed 2006's The Break Up, stylizes ""Wasp"" as a fast-paced and whiz-bang affair. Heck, he even throws in a science lab as a diminished suitcase and a long-winded car chase via the streets of San Francisco (eat your darn heart out Steve McQueen).With ""Wasp"", Peyton relies less on extravagance and morbid destruction and more on cartoonish hyperbole. He's quickly trying to distract you from his unexplained expansion of the Ant-Man universe (the shrinking technology of humans and objects needs backtracking and gets complicated here). His Ant-Man and the Wasp is a hot mess, with goofy humored quips at the end of each scene and a spine-tingling villain named Ghost (naturally). The original Ant-Man while less funny, is leaner and meaner with more grounded storytelling. Bottom line: I liked both flicks equally but I can't explain why. Rating: 3 stars."
876,7,"Light and Breezy Fun but Ultimately a Forgettable Entry in the MCU There are movies in this genre that pride themselves on being edgy or gritty and that works to mixed results (the Dark Knight absolutely pulls this off, BvS.... not so much). Ant-Man and the Wasp goes the other way and especially with this movie, creates something for the whole family. I don't mind that idea, not everything has to be adult oriented and this movie does a better job than it doesn't in that regard. There's a bigger focus on family dynamics and scenes between Scott (Paul Rudd) and his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Forston) or Scott and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) work more often than they don't. I do think some of the comedic value suffers but that' a relatively small complaint (more on that later).While the original Ant-Man boasted some creative action scenes, I think that department is the one area than Ant-Man and the Wasp ramps up. They play with the shrinking constantly and they use it to fun effect. Moments like the gag with the salt shaker or the Hello Kitty pez dispenser (which you see in the trailers) play out with a different and entertaining rhythm. Most of those moments were the highlights of Ant-Man and the Wasp for me.Despite being disappointed by the movie overall, I can't blame the cast. The first person I want to credit is Evangeline Lilly who really steps up in this movie. I really like how they expanded on her character, but she gets her shot in this and she runs away with it. Hope is the focus in this movie instead of Scott and I didn't mind that. Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas are both decent, they seemed to be more toned down, but they're both appropriately cast and perform their parts well. Michael Pena stole so many scenes in the first one and while I do prefer him in the original, he brought some needed levity and he's got huge range as an actor. Most of the new additions to this franchise are great. Laurence Fishburne and Hannah John-Kamen work really well together and there are a few emotional beats with them that I dug. Michelle Pfeiffer made the most of her screen time and while we had to wait longer than I wanted to for her appearance (minus the flashbacks), it was worth it. Randall Park walked a fine line between being funny and unrealistically stupid as Jimmy Woo and Walton Goggins excelled in his supporting role.Most of my issues with this movie aren't outright missteps or mistakes, they're the result of heightened expectations and then the movie coming up short. I mentioned above that they found new ways to ramp up the action scenes and they packed a lot of excitement. The flipside of that is that they spoiled all the best moments in the trailer, if you've seen the marketing for Ant-Man and the Wasp, there won't be many surprises when it comes to the set pieces (big or small). The movie lacks a true antagonist with 2 or 3 characters filling that role and while they buck the trend with that decision, there isn't anything to compensate for that. But I will admit that one of the few problems with the original was that Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) was ageneric villain so there's not a huge slide in this regard. There are exposition dumps in here that don't serve a purpose because they're filled with so much technobabble. Every superhero movie has some of that but there was so much here that I couldn't help but notice. They did a great job of expanding on Hope's character but to make her more competent, they dialed back Scott's ability. He's way more of a passenger in this and he comes across as a buffoon when he's supposed to be a brilliant engineer. I also think the movie lacks the sharp comedic dialogue the original boasted. Michael Pena, T.I., Randall Park and David Dastmalchian are more than capable but their jokes just didn't hit like they did before, and I thought most of Paul Rudd's comedic material was downright lame.I enjoyed Ant-Man and the Wasp, and I can understand why the collective audience was happy with this entry in the MCU. Its very family-friendly, there's some new characters that got a chance to shine and it has its share of thrills. But I thought the first Ant-Man was a more inspired and better film overall. Fitting it into the heist genre gave it a different tone and made the film standout in bigger superhero blockbuster game. While the cast was great, and I wanted to spend more time in this universe, this is not going to be one of the Marvel movies I revisit frequently. I would absolutely recommend this to families but unless you loved the original Ant Man or a diehard Marvel fan, I would say you have to catch this opening weekend."
877,7,"Flawed and fun. I enjoyed Ant-Man & The Wasp way more than the first film right off the bat. It has no origin stories or any boring mumbo jumbo you'd expect within an origin story.Ant-Man is a lightweight compared to the other heroes in the MCU. Therefore his stories are smaller in scale and more personal, making it a palette cleanser for anyone who was depressed after Avengers: Infinity War.Paul Rudd I felt was able to do more with his comedic chops in this one than in the first. I liked where Scott Lang was at during the events of this film and it's fun to see him entertain himself while he's in house arrest. Evangeline Lilly is able to show him whose boss in this film and she's more than capable of holding down her own in all of her Wasp scenes. I did feel their romance was off to a good start, until she kissed him after he fainted when he was Giant-Man for too long. It felt slightly rushed and unnatural, but that's just me.Michael Douglas is not the walking exposition he once was in the first film. He still provides it, but he's got more to do with both Scott and Hope in the search for her long lost wife, Janet played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She has very little screen time in the film, and I understand that the film revolved around reuniting with her so it worked well in that sense, but the problem I had was her ability to heal Ghost's phasing. Obviously it's only temporary, but I found that part of her character extremely corny. The film does have a lot of science mumbo jumbo, but it's self aware enough to poke fun at itself.Now speaking of Ghost, I didn't love or hate the villains in this film, to be honest there really wasn't a villain. I didn't mind Hannah John-Kamen's performance, but I had a problem with her character creatively. If she was recruited by SHIELD, where was she the entire time? In Captain America: The Winter Solider, why didn't SHIELD just send her and Winter Solider to take down Cap? Now perhaps she was kept way in the dark, that not even Fury had access too, or even HYDRA, but that wasn't even mentioned or elaborated. I didn't think she needed that kind of exposition. I liked Laurence Fishburn in the film as he takes up the father-figure like role of Ghost. I expected him to be a cameo of sorts but it was a nice surprise. Walter Goggins does his thing with a Southern accent, but ultimately I didn't feel like his role was necessary in the film.Other cast members are great, I really liked Randall Park as FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Aside from Michael Pena, I did feel like TI and Dave Dastmalchian's roles here were smaller and I wouldn't have minded seeing them a little more. Comedy this time is a lot more tamed. It still had a lot of that annoying Marvel humor, but overall I was able to tolerate it a lot more. Pena I'd like to mention tones down his Luis a little more which was nice to see as I wasn't a huge fan of his character originally.I think the action is way more amplified in this one than it was in the first. Not to say the first film didn't have great action, but I appreciated that they didn't try to redo what they did in the first film. They spiced it up a little with Ghost who phases more than Vision ever did in his screen time so far in the MCU. It was nice to see Ant-Man go giant again and Wasp's fight scenes are kinetic and full of energy. Shrinking scenes are fantastic and the usage of ants are still fun and unique.Peyton Reed does a commendable job and the film like I said is a nice change of pace after Infinity War. It's certainly not Marvel's best film, but it is leaps and bounds better and more enjoyable than the first.Obviously you want to stick around for the end credits. The last one is a gag, but the mid-credit one is what got my blood flowing.7/10"
878,8,Casual fun A great movie to watch if you want to experience a fair share of laughs and just relax a bit. The jokes pretty much hit the spot and the movie never tries too hard with its conedy.
879,9,"Quantum In Size Yet Colossal In Fun! Just like the first installment of Ant-man, I didn't expect much, and yet again I was unexpectedly impressed; but this time even more so. From the Ant-man suits to the overall environment and surroundings, plus the colors and textures graphically used looked quite raw and fresh. Most of the CGI looked crisp and consistent with only minor hiccups, but they were so minor that their not even worth mentioning.The cast itself flowed quite nicely. Paul Rudd did such a phenomenal job that you can't think of anyone else playing Ant-man, from delivering a fair amount of zany humor, to some of his serious moments, Paul Rudd hit it out of the park. Lovely Evangeline Lilly aka Hope Pym, daughter of Hank Pym - was nothing short of noteworthy. Although she's 'kind of sort of' Ant-Mans sidekick, it should be the other way around. From portraying a vibrant and savvy Hope Pym, to the most impressive fight scenes, Evangeline more than delivered her part as Hope Pym. And Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, what can I say except that it's Michael Douglas, enough said - he was simply brilliant! As for Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, I will admit it took me a little while to get use to her as ghost, but eventually I came around and really started relishing her performance. Some of the main side characters like Laurence Fishburne as Bill Foster & Michael Pena as Luis, brought two totally different personalities to the film yet executed their parts thoroughly & fittingly!I can't believe that I enjoyed this film more than the Justice League film, why am I even bringing this up (Antman and the Wasp vs Justice League), it just goes to show that if Ant-man was more gratifying than the entire Justice League (film), then that in and of itself conveys just how good Ant-man and the Wasp really was. And I'm not even being bias, as a matter of fact I've always been more of a DC fan, in the comic book world DC still knocks it out of the park, but when it comes to the big screen, Marvel's simply that much better.Go see Ant-man And The Wasp, Quantum In Size Yet Colossal In Fun!"
880,4,"Not as good as should have been Awaited squeal... did provide the canon connections all been waiting for...did preserve linage and forecast into next stories...yes, did all that housekeeping stuff (used word ""stuff"" so maybe have a chance to fit with new mentality of moviegoers). But, speaking of content, speaking of mentality of script recipients viewing movies, wow, was like the first movie played in reverse. Same devices and, the masses loved it (of course they did! Look at the bro. trucks and fast and furious cars in the parking lot). But, content... So, Ant-man was arrested for... helping the world (in Civil War movie, which is another standalone issue... fighting aliens in cities, things blow up, let's have an accord to prosecute. Fine rational thinking there... really?)And same recipe as first movie, with interjections of hilarious moments like...Scott playing digital drums when cops walk in..., wow, amazing. And, speaking of bland & predictable... character of Paul Rudd... just basic, easy-going, it's all good, family ex-con, electrical engineer basic fun loving Cali dude.Everyone wants more of that. Of course they do."
881,1,"What I expected. So I just saw Ant-Man and The Wasp and I have to say I'm not disappointed but it was not as great as everyone says it is. For starters every action scene in the movie is in the trailer and pretty much all of the comedy is in the trailer plus he jokes just went good. This movie seemed as though the writers ran out of ideas in the middle of making this movie it's just my thought, plus the after credits scenes sucked everyone said that it's mindblowing and just take a few guesses and you know what the scene is. But besides that this is not is a terrible movie or a great one if you don't feel like going out to the movies then don't waist your time at this one."
882,7,"More action - less ideas. Shortly, without spoilers. Despite critics praises about how good this film is, personally, I feel some disappoint. Overall film is focusing about family members reuniting. From one side we see how Scott Lang trying to return back to her daughter after FBI puts him on home arrest(outcome after Civil War). From another side, Pym family, Hope Van Dyne and Hank Pym who are trying their best to return Hank wife, Hope's - mother, from quantum world, where she was locked for more than 30 years. Obviously the weakest thing in Ant man and the Wasp - it is the scenario. We does not feel any tension and threat to our heroes during their mission. The sequel doesn't have strong and solid villain. We have some short sighted and weak Tech mafia who chasing our heroes fin order to get their tech developments. We have comedy FBI agents who chasing main heroes. Of course, there is Ghost, but the more we understand and learn about this character, the more questions we ask our self, are she really so bad and her actions are? Yes this film is full of action scenes, which show to us more Pym technologies, and it also has more comedy scenes then in first movie, but we can't said it is much funnier as it was ""Thor3: Ragnarok"". Joke on joke, actions scenes and jokes inside of them, moment of some small tension and jokes again, after a while it really gets boring. Only scenes with Mikael Pena character bring joy every time when we see him on the screen, oh yes and of course Randall Park - everything he say and how he say - is it hilarious. Paul Rudd - absolutely the same, as he were in first movie and Civil War. Evangeline Lily got more screen time, well yes, because she is the WASP(!) and she is one of the main characters, and because about 80% of all actions scenes in this movie, include her character. Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, i don't know, her personage is mystery for me, empty place, i can't say i like her, but that's probably because of script and not about her acting skills. Once again main villain in ANT MAN and the WASP is screenwriters. Their lack of ideas and maximum interest on actions scenes, instead of dialogs and building new strong characters, poses last Marvel movie as a typical summer blockbuster for people who just wants to came in cinema to eat some popcorn. PS:God, i already want to hear review from CinemaCins."
883,2,"This film is a sappy ploy to get women and kids in the theater Sappy and saccharine in its blatant attempt to get mom into the theater with her kids, which when you think about it isn't a bad marketing ploy since we all know mom decides how the family money is spent.But although I loath super hero movies as the over-produced, 2 hour cliche's they are, this one put me off from the start. We have the non-threatening Paul Rudd flitting about the screen like some pre-pubescent boy acting like a child with a child.And finally the scene of him killing time and playing some more after the Feds toss his house was enough to make me want to watch Reservoir Dogs, just to restore some sense of balance."
884,8,"Fun Family Movie This is a great family movie. Nope, it's nothing like the traditional MCU movies but it is fun to watch. By the way, it' very funny. TI was very funny."
885,9,Great movie! Very funny and better than the first! Awesome! Keeps the attention throughout the movie.
886,8,"Good things come in small packages The quantum realm is of interest to many people. A way to find Janet(Pfeiffer, making the most of very little screen time, great chemistry with her family) to Hank(Douglas, his temper toned down... for the better) and Hope(Lilly, an equal co-star, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that women do deserve representation(as if it wasn't already obvious...) here. Finally the MCU makes one a lead, and half the title of a movie. Badass, with a heart, and a great partner). Lang(Rudd, the everyman, a great father) wants to help them out, but is worried about his house arrest following the events of Civil War. So they have to hide him from the FBI. At least his ex and her fiance now love him like his daughter does. I guess they're passionately Team Cap? I mean, last we saw them, they were like, ""just don't break the law and lose time with your little girl again"". If they asked ""did you even think about Cassie when called to Germany?"", they can't have been very happy with the answer that he said ""I'd be working outside the law? A wanted man? what else is new?"". I figure it was considered a funny contrast to the first one. I agree, and I'd add heart-warming. I get if some hate it, though. It is inconsistent. Anyway. To Ghost(John-Kamen, compelling, with a tragic backstory, dangerous, willing to go to extreme lengths to save herself from pain and dying soon), it's a way to stabilize her from the phasing that she can barely control, and continues to take a toll on her, physically and emotionally. And to Sonny(Goggins, always worth watching), it's a way to get rich by having access to something a lot would love to use, and no one else can control. His presence means there are several groups of armed men for the heroes to defeat. That's an element that almost always improves these flicks. These are more antagonists than villains. Basically, all three(well, the feds just want to catch them in the act) of these individuals and groups try to get, from the good guys, the vehicle and tunnel that allows accessing this mysterious dimension.While most of the action, including the best of it, is in the trailers and TV spots, it's fun, creative and exciting, in how it uses the shrinking and growing. There is now no less than 3 people who can do it, and it's done to buildings, cars, at least a dozen man-sized ants(at least one of whom is seeing casually engaging in human activities. Bet you thought that drumming one you've seen the marketing was a dream sequence), and the occasional everyday object, all to memorable effect. This keeps to a fast pace, and the jokes(less messy than you'd expect from 5 writers) tend to land, which helps distract from the straightforward plot.This earns the PG-13 rating. The parents guide on this site has details. I recommend this to those who agree that, after Infinity War, we needed something more light. If you don't think so, I can understand - and honestly, this can essentially be skipped. just look up what the mid- and post-credit scenes are. It's a fluffy dessert after the gourmet meal that film was. And hey, Avengers 4 is less than a year away. 8/10"
887,7,"Funny and fun! ...But my least favorite MCU movie - 68% (Favorable) I did enjoy this movie. It was funny, had really cool effects, fun action scenes, and a few heartwarming moments. However, I could say the same things for every other movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Incredible Hulk was always my least favorite Marvel movie - it was the only one that I didn't actually like and think was good. I still don't think it's bad and enjoy it quite a bit. That is sort of how I feel about this movie and I think it may actually be my least favorite MCU movie.I liked the original Ant-man- I thought it was pretty good but even then it was in the bottom 3 MCU movies for me. This movie is very much like the first, but not quite as good. Like the first, this movie is pretty self-contained and light, but it feels like it's juggling a few too many story lines which consequently takes away from the main narrative. Hope is probably the brightest part of the movie, and Micheal Pena delivers most of the good comedy, but Paul Rudd himself doesn't really stand out much. The main villain is decent but felt rushed and Walton Goggins was completely wasted. Throughout the movie I was mostly just mildly entertained. In fact, the most excitement I felt was waiting for the mid-credits scene. The post-credits scene however was a waste of time.Overall, this is another fun MCU movie, but a pretty forgettable one that doesn't do much to justify it's existence."
888,7,"Fun Just two months after having premiered ""Avengers Infinity War"", ""Ant-Man the Wasp"" is the movie that Marvel Cinematic Universe needed. Unlike the boring ""Ant-Man"" feature that came and went three years ago, the two hours you'll spend running around with this Marvel's Ant, is fun and as an action comedy, this movie hits all the marks. It's imaginative, full of action and has great visual effects. Marvel Studios succeeds this time and this sequel makes it clear that in the future, Ant-Man could become an even more important character for them. Paul Rudd is amazing and director Peyton Reed does a good job. ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is another great example of what comic book movies should be: a lot of fun."
889,10,"Freaking AWESOME Loved this movie so much! It was awesome, funny, and entertaining the whole way through. I don't have one bad thing to say about it. I wanted to stay in the theater and see it again. Highly recommended!!!!"
890,7,Good follow up The movie is a bit random and slow but it's very entertaining and funny. You have to like this kind of humor. I think Paul Rudd does an amazing job.
891,10,"Better than the first! This is not your typical MCU movie. In a time when superhero fatigue is beginning to show its teeth, it is nice to see a little change of pace from the typical ""hero vs villain"" playbook. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Plus, the post credit scene will blow you away!!"
892,9,"Loved it. Everything about this movie was well executed and perfectly timed after the heavy ending to IW.The relationship between Scott and his daughter is truly epic and much like my own relationships with my girls. (Some idiot actually said those scenes were cheesy ???? Must not have daughters. If he does, I'd question his parenting).The movie had solid laughs. Good action. And an engaging storyline. It's supposed to be entertaining, it's not meant to be cinematic art. ITS SUPPOSED to be tongue in cheek. He's the superhero that only means well but is cursed to always make the wrong choice.If you want a more upbeat flick with good laughs and action, then this is the movie for you. Think Lethal Weapon 2."
893,10,"Marvel Nailed it again! I'll be short. It's your usual Marvel film. It's well-Written, with great Characters, lots of Laughs, and some great action. The film easily stands on its own. But at the same time, the End ties in directly to Infinity War. Great Film! Enjoy!"
894,6,"A jovial romp - but largely inconsequential. Coming only a few months after the intense behemoth that was Infinity War, the second Ant-Man instalment, and the 20th entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), serves as a much needed, light-hearted come down. It's not completely inconsequential-the movie's quantum realm potentially having big MCU ramifications (and stay during the end credits)-but the story of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, entertaining as ever) reluctantly returning to a life of heroics after two years under house arrest is more diverting than essential. Where its strengths lie is in character; the elevation of Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), aka the Wasp, from love-interest sidekick to fully-fledged partner generates increased opportunities for witty repartee and interesting character decisions, not least revolving around Lang's desire to balance fatherhood with Avenging. Lilly also adds an additional level of badass-ery, outshining Rudd in the hand-to-hand combat and arguably given the lion's share of the 'hero shots'. A first act restaurant-set dust-up very quickly cements her fighting status at expert. The action set-pieces in general are delivered with the expected level of whimsy, a lengthy car chase throughout the hilly streets of San Fran offering some amusing shrinking moments complete with hot-wheels sound effects. Unfortunately the tongue-in-cheek tone doesn't cover for all flaws, chief among them Walter Goggins' embarrassingly one-dimensional black-market baddie who seems to have walked in direct from an episode of a cheesy 80s TV show. It lacks the scope and sheer awesomeness of other MCU outings, but with a winning lead duo (and another hilarious performance from Michael Pena as Lang's fast-talking ex-con pal Luis), Ant-Man and the Wasp is a jovial romp that'll put a smile on your face."
895,8,"Ant-Man and the Wasp Teamin' Up! With Avengers: Infinity War behind us, I was expecting Ant-Man and the Wasp to offer a much-needed comedic boost to the MCU. Thankfully, that is exactly what I got. A feel-good, undemanding ride that benefited from its funny cast and where all the jokes hit the right note. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) worked decently together, neither character ever taking away from the other's arc, while side-characters benefited from a plethora of comedic moments. Now was it perfect? By no means, unfortunately most of the action had been spoiled in the trailers beforehand and there was the annoying Marvel villain problem. While Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) had a certain flair to her both in and out of her awesome suit, she didn't really bring much to the table. Also, some of the quantum-realm mumbo-jumbo boggled minds and made little sense. The final flaw in my opinion was Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet Van Dyne, who had very little, if nothing to do. In the end, Ant-Man and the Wasp was an insanely entertaining superhero summer flick that bested the first and let its characters grow in one way or another, with some missable flaws scattered throughout.The good: -Inventive action -Paul Rudd's, Michael Douglas's, Randall Park's and Michael Pena's comedic moments -Cool tech -Awesome costume design, especially for the villain, Ghost -Cassie Lang was an excellent supporting character -Hope Van Dyne added a cool team dynamicThe bad: -One-off villain -Laurence Fishburne was a little underutilized -Predictable story -Janet Van Dyne's role -Spoiled action"
896,7,"7.5 Funny Movie With An Alright Plot The first Ant-Man was a pleasant surprise even though Edgar Wright left the project. It brought a unique experience to the MCU. This movie provides a welcome change of pace after the darker Infinty War. This was a movie that you could just sit back and enjoy. The action was fun and the humor felt natural. The story was where I had some issues. It takes a bit to get going because the film tries to catch you up with what everybody's been doing since the first Ant-Man. The ending had some problems too. It felt a little too perfect until the end credits. Ghost was an ok villain with a great performance. Sonny Burch however stood out in a bad way. There was really no arc for him. The wasp was a good complement to Ant-Man. The two worked well with each other with some great team up fights. I wish they could have used more of Scott's knowledge from his criminal days to aid in the mission. Scott being an ex criminal made him unique from the other heroes. The Three Wombats were still the standout characters just like the first one. They made for some entertaining and funny scenes. Overall, the movie is a fun time and I can't wait to see it again on Blu-Ray."
897,6,"""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" just leaves too little of a impact Ant-Man had a complicated beginning when it first came out in 2015. While it was credited to be one of the lightest and airy of the MCU films, at the same time it suffocated under the shadow of its other game changers the released before it. And after Avengers: Infinity War, I felt like Ant-Man and the Wasp would be a nice time to take a breather after the events of the film.The film takes place shortly after Captain America: Civil War, where Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is in house arrest from those events. Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lily) reaches out for him to help them find her mother who they believe is still in the Quantum Realm after many years.This film made me appreciate Paul Rudd's personality and his charisma that he brings to his character. Hope is given a solid majority of the runtime to show off her range of emotions and ability to fight back and prove her strength. Michael Pena makes a return and brings all the likable things he offered in the original despite not really providing much to the plot like last time.While after having villains like Killmonger and Thanos proving that better villains were coming to the MCU, Ghost in this movie comes to break that hot streak. While she has interesting powers, her motivation feels a bit too complicated. Also there's another villain unrelated to Ghost that feels more like a road block than a actual threat. There's one impactful moment in the end that feels rushed and never explained how or why it's even possible, which is strange given everything else in the movie is over explained.The conflicting feeling I have for Ant-Man bled over into Ant-Man and the Wasp. While I credit the film for its smaller scale and breezed tone, I feel like it gets drowned out by just not leaving as much of a emotional impact as they should. It's never a bad film, it just sometimes feels too till you almost don't see it in the bigger picture.By the way, your REALLY going to want to stay for the mid-Credits scene for this one.Rating: 6.4 / 10"
898,4,"Way, way too much plot and too many non-essential characters sharing the screen Don't get me wrong, the large cast thing can work--if all the characters are interesting and have a point. Not to give anything away, but there's a sub-plot that takes way, way, way too much time.You need one hero, and one villain. Anything beyond that is just waters things down. This movie meanders all over the place to no good point.I liked the first movie, but I was tempted to walk out on this one more than once. In retrospect, I wish I had. They should have made a buddy movie with Rudd and Pena, and left it at that.One question... Why is woman being a jerk considered being ""strong""?"
899,10,"good enough for vacations It is a funny and enterteinment movie, good for going with the family and enjoy for this sason, good visual effects, I like when the heroes are for getting you fun and not for depress you like other heroes movies, well done"
900,8,Great Sequel!! Thought the story line was wonderful!! Truly entertaining. The entire cast did amazing. Thanks guys :)
901,8,"In a word...fun By this time, either you are ""in"" on the Marvel Cinematic Universe or you are ""out"". If you are ""out"", there's not a whole lot that I (or any other reviewer) will be able to do to change your mind. Which is too bad, for the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a pretty fun ride. The folks at Marvel ""have it down"" and I can't remember the last time that I was disappointed by a Marvel movie.And that goes for the latest installment - ANTMAN AND THE WASP.Starring Paul Rudd and Evangaline Lilly as the titular characters, ANT-MAN AND THE WASP is the follow-up to 2015's ANT-MAN and (more directly) 2016's CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. It also answers the question as to why these characters were not involved in the other Marvel movie this summer - AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, Part 1.But, like most of the Marvel films, the plot doesn't really matter, it is the characters and the situations they are put in that matter. And, in the case of this film, the word I would use for both is FUN.Starting with bickering stars Rudd and Lilly. They do the ""frenemies with a no-doubter mutual attraction"" thing very well. They play off each other smartly, with Lilly's common sense, physicality and ""cut the crap"" attitude in vast contrast to Rudd's ""man-child"". Both are winning presences on the screen, with Rudd's natural charm jumping at you in places where (if it didn't) his character would seem like a jerk.Joining in the fun is Michael Douglas as, basically, the referee for these two. He looks like he's having fun - despite himself - and really comes into his own with his character. Randall Park does a fun turn as a Federal Agent charged with keeping an eye on Rudd's character and Lawrence Fishburne brings ""Morpheus-like"" gravitas to his role as a fellow scientist.But...like in the first Ant-Man film...the characters that steal the film are Michael Pena and his two dim-witted assistants, David Dastmalchian and T.I. When any one of these three (but, especially Pena) are on the screen, the maniacal, fun energy of this film rises dramatically. They had me wishing that they would have their own film to themselves. But..maybe I like them so much because they are being fed to us in very small doses.Unfortunately, Judy Greer and Bobby Canavale (from the first film) and Walton Goggins (new to this film) don't really have enough to do - and when they are given something to do, it pales in comparison to the others - and to the action.And what terrific action there is! Filmmaker Peyton Reed (he also Directed Ant Man) does a nice job of keeping the action simple (enough) that you always knew what was going on and playing with size (now they're BIG, now they're SMALL, now they're NORMAL size...) was used wisely to always drive the film - and the action - forward.As with all Marvel films, this one has a place in the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe (a place I won't spoil here), but I was satisfied with how they dealt with this film as a stand alone, ""chase"" movie, yet still connected to the rest.A good time was had.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
902,8,"Fun and enjoyable movie Good movie; lots of action sequences, fun and tuns of humor and jokes (this is marvel, you know), everything's great, just like the first one. The plot is really really simple, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) want to bring Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) back from the quantum realm because they think she might be alive; they need Scott Lang (Paul Rudd)'s help but he is on house arrest, besides he feels like he was her for a moment and that proves they are right; meanwhile a female villain named Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) is a menace for them and they have to fight with her, she is a good character. Evangeline Lilly is wonderful as The Wasp and we want to see more of She and Ant-Man in action and their chemistry.There are 2 post-credit scenes, the first one is awesome and connects with Infinity War & Avengers 4."
903,8,"Huge Fun from Small Heroes Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fast-paced summer blockbuster made to entertain. Not heavy-handed like some entries in the MCU, but also not as overwhelmingly silly as others (looking at you, Thor: Ragnarok), this Ant-Man sequel successfully puts a smile on your face and keeps it there through its entire 2-hour runtime. Likeable characters with relatable storyarchs and problems mixed with truly clever action sequences (which don't rely on mass destruction to entertain) make Ant-Man and the Wasp one of the most enjoyable entries into the MCU. It may not be the best film, and may have forgettable elements, but Ant-Man and the Wasp is a joy to watch and should not be missed by anyone in or out of the MCU loop."
904,9,"Perfect combo of action and fun Great characters, great actors, and action. Rudd is great. A worthy sequel. Enjoyed the comic side of the action super heroes. Welcome relief from all intense action of some of the other superheroes. Enjoy!!"
905,9,"C'mon Get Happy - Size Matters; Fun Tonic of the MCU with a Saltine dry Rudd in top-form ANT-MAN AND THE WASP (2018) ***1/2 Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Pena, Hannah John-Kamen, Laurence Fishburne, Walton Goggins, Bobby Cannavale, Jane Greer, Tip 'T.I.' Harris, David Dastmalchian, Abby Ryder Fortson, Randall Park. Fast and vastly fun sequel to the ongoing MCU hero who can shrink and grow (with the help of the snazzy super-suit he dons), with Rudd (in gleeful, deadpan, Saltine-dry mode) returning to aid Hank Pym and his daughter Hope (Douglas and the yummy Lilly) attempt to rescue his wife/her mom Janet from the 'quantum realm' micro world she's been imprisoned for thirty years all the while under house-arrest and facing new foes, the mass-passing Ghost (John-Kamen) and oily Goggins' Sonny Burch who has eyes on Pym's size-fits-all technology for evil (what else?) Filmmaker Peyton Reed returns as well and keeps pace at a brisk romp with some sweet fight sequences, amazing visual effects and a punch-drunk screenplay by Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Andrew Barrer, Gabriel Ferrari and Rudd contributing too with sly comedic quips, one-liners and slapstick galore. As Rudd's BFF Pena steals the show in a riotous 'truth serum' scene. My only quibble is not enough giantess sequences (i.e. the original's danger on the dance floor) or a 'big' Lilly (well, only in IMAX which worked enough for me ;D ) PS: fun inevitable Stan Lee cameo and yes wait for the pre-end and post credits to see what actually became of the crew here re: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR (!)"
906,8,"The Wasp adds the ""dynamic"" into the ""dynamic duo"" Honestly, didn't think much of the first Ant-Man movie. But this... a whole lot better. The Wasp kicks ass, simply put, and Lilly played the part perfectly. The humour is on point and the plot doesn't seem to be lacking anything. Usually I am not a fan of comedies and light-hearted movies, but this one really did put a smile on my face (before the post-credits scene, of course). Would recommend to anyone."
907,6,"Really good commercial MCU movie Really good commercial MCU movies , story processes without any useless extra clip but story also just considered it is a really good commercial movie and comic superhero movie and it would be successful but won't give surprise to audiences anymore"
908,10,"Outstanding! Every bit as good as the first, which certainly isn't always the case with sequels, plus I thought the first movie was outstanding."
909,7,Great summer movie! The story is ok (albeit lots of quantum nonsense) but funny altogether. Had a great time at the theater with my popcorn and soda laughing every now and then. It revolves around the past of the main characters connecting to other Marvel movies such as Civil War and Infinity War.You can connect with the characters and the action and CGI are great in the big screen. It will not be a movie to remeber for the future but definetely a great summer movie for these days.
910,7,"Improves on everything from the first movie! Ant-man and the Wasp is now one of my favorite Marvel movies. Ant-man was already one of my favorites but had a large problem...the villain was terrible. This movie (which technically has two villains) did the whole villain thing alooooot better. On top of the great villains the action was absolutely great and a lot of fun, the shrinking and phasing created some of the best in the MCU. And lastly, by far one of the funniest MCU movies to date. I'm already a big fan of Paul Rudd and he was great, on top of that Michael Pena stole the show, he was absolutely hilarious. I think everyone should see this movie it's impossible not to enjoy.P.S. (the CGI is reeeallly good)"
911,9,"Fun movie with great action This a fun summer movie. Paul Rudd is perfect in this role and the supporting cast is fantastic. It's a great blend of comedy and action. While it doesn't answer any questions from Infinity War, it is a great addition to the Marvel Movie colllection."
912,6,"About as good as the first one. And that's not good. Another weak storyline with too much attempted humor that lands flat. The villain wasn't a compelling foe. A cameo by Michelle Pfieffer helped, but didn't give her much to do. For me, the Ant Man movies have been on par with the Green Lantern miss."
913,7,"Laughs are big for this small scaled movie It's a very fun and funny movie. Again, like the first one this one works on a smaller scale (pun intended). Unlike the first one though, this villain is better. I don't even know if I'd really want to call Ghost the villain. She is definitely the antagonist but she's doing what she's doing to survive. And you can feel empathetic to her and her situation.Plus, unlike Yellowjacket the heroes had more one on one battles with her. She proved to be a tougher adversary.The science didnt always make sense. Like the first one, they will scale heavy objects and suddenly they're light weight enough to carry even though the point of scaling down Scott and Hope is that they retain their mass. And in this one, they're carrying around a building. Like, it doesnt make a lot sense and they dont bother trying to explain it. It makes for some cool sequences, but its not logical. And I feel like Michelle Pfeiffer ex machina'd the situation a couple times.I did really like the humor though. There was a couple of times, where they could have toned it down a bit to keep a scene feeling intense, but otherwise the movie is just hilarious and kind of refreshing to come into after something like Infinity War.For now, I think Im leaning towards a 7.5 rating. I really enjoyed it, but its not a top 5 contender for me, you know?"
914,5,"It's okay If you love shallow movies.There isn't any depth in this movie. The jokes, story, villains, subplots. It all falls flat. It all one-dimensional. We have a mysterious-looking antagonist named Ghost, but she doesn't have a layer, she can't be mysterious, and at one point she serves up a clot of over complicated exposition that gives the film little bit action. You don't care if she'll accomplish her goal or not. You don't even care which side is going to win. We have lots of jokes, but they're all stale. If you find this humour funny, I'm sorry, I just can't take the movie seriously. While some ''intense'' interrogation scene was going on someone's cell is ringing with a joke sound. And this call is in this movie just because to be there - just because to be ''funny''. It doesn't have any contribution to the story or the storytelling, it just there like that Russian family from Justice League. We have a story that concerns a rescue mission. But there isn't any complexity or twist that blows the audience away. Just flat. You could easily predict what's going to happen next. We have a subplot concerning a romantic relationship between Antman and the Wasp, but there isn't much, it just teases us around, and that's all. We have another subplot concerning a lovely relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter, which is not very well developed but still a little bit heartwarming because it's a relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter.While a woman who is in constant physical and emotional pain is trying not to die, the movie is trying to be funny. Peyton Reed maybe should've gone for the head, not chest. But then again, he can't, Disney has the strings. It got to try to be colorful, amiable, ''funny'' with forced jokes and fake actings. I really wonder when Marvel and Disney are going to take some risks and make a groundbreaking superhero movie. I guess never. Critics fine with eating the same turd for 10 years.There isn't any climax, or depth, or emotion. Just a filler movie with no heart and soul.PS. Amazing FBI work right there. It was too realistic for this movie 10/10"
915,9,"More light-hearted but still very good Ant-Man is a really interesting superhero in the MCU universe cause unlike each member in The Evengers I never heard of the guy untill the movie and the sequel Ant-Man and the Wasp make me care about him more cause he literally the underdog of the MCU.In the suit Scott Lang maybe a superhero that can control insects and power to change size but out of the suit he just a thief with a heart of gold that care about his family and friends more that saving the world.I particularly like this movie more than the first cause I can see more of Scott daily live which is hilarious and the so called new antagonists""Ghost"" that caugh me off guard when her motivation to go again the good guys is very reasonable and kinda sad if you think about it."
916,5,"useless movie Does not bring nothing new to the world of the avengers or marvel. Ghost was pretty cool but didn't do a lot in the movie, after watching it i felt bored. They spend the whole movie wanting to find the original wasp in a Quantum universe, and that was it. The action is good but nothing out of this world, this was a sure cash grab."
917,7,"Ant-Man gets a fresh and fun redo Like a lot of sequels, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" feels like a repeat of the original story as opposed to a continuation of it. What makes ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" work while doing this, however, is that the movie feels like it realized the issues of the first movie and are in a way redoing it in a better manner.There are a lot of similar story points between the first ""Ant-Man"" and this one. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is almost out of trouble with the law and he gets roped into helping the Pyms. The overarching theme of the movie deals with the relationships between parents and their children. Scott almost sacrifices himself by going to a size that is dangerous for him to be at. Luis (Michael Pena) gets to do another one of his long, comical stories. They redo the relationship between Scott and Hope (Evangeline Lilly). As stated above though, this all works because, with the exception of the Scott and Hope relationship, it feels in a way like a redo as opposed to a repeat.The Scott story line works better in this movie because he both has things to gain and lose by offering his help to Pyms. The theme of parents and their children also works better because there are more personal scenes dedicated to each character about this specific topic, and it actually shows the dire lengths of the characters' actions because of it. Scott almost sacrificing himself by going to a dangerous size works because, one, it's Ant-Man, what else can he really do, and two, because this sacrifice is not the climax of the movie like it was last time, so it's different enough. The Luis story in this one was just used as a comedy bit instead of a way for their to be an information dump to explain everything to Scott and thus the audience.That isn't to say there aren't original ideas for the movie. The villains this time around are not an all mighty, all powerful super villain; they are a group of black market dealers. The other villains of the movie are also more sympathetic anti-heroes than villains. This gives the movie a refreshing feel for a super hero flick and seems appropriately quaint for an ""Ant-Man"" movie. The mission in the movie also isn't some big, elaborate mission like the heist in the first movie: it's the characters simply going around trying to complete a science experiment to rescue Hope's mother from the quantum realm.The two things that really elevate the movie, though, are the writing and the fun the movie has with the ability for things to change sizes. The comedy is funny in this movie, which it isn't in a lot of Marvel films, and it never feels like it's derailing the emotional undertone of the whole story, nor does it ever undermine an emotional scene by ending with a bad joke. Everything that is set up has a pay off to it, which is probably why the movie is funnier than other one: because some of the jokes get setups and payoffs instead of them all just being the characters saying whacky things.The movie also has more fun with the resizing abilities of the characters than the first movie did. In the first movie, the creativity of what could happen didn't really seem to happen until the last scene of the movie, but in this one the characters utilize the ability to change the size of numerous objects to assist them in their fights. The Pyms also have an assortment of shrinkable objects to help them, including a shrinking building that acts as a suitcase and a Hot Wheels container filled with cars that can be resized for usage.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is plagued by some unoriginality, but more than makes up for it due to its self-awareness of the previous movie and how to make this new one work."
918,8,"Marvel's Smallest Heroes Steal The Spotlight ANT-MAN AND THE WASP IS A HILARIOUS RETURN TO THE SHRINKING HEROES, BUT WITH ELEVATED ACTION AND A HEARTFELT STORY, IT'S A WELL-ROUNDED MARVEL SEQUEL."
919,6,"Light as much as it can be IMO this is a step down from the first movie.The previous movie had a good villain and a good background story for all characters. The focus was clear and the challenge was gripping and story was smooth.This time the challenge for the heroes is overly distracted. There are FBI, family issues, mobs and a super villain but all of them are weak, uninteresting and not well presented. Wasp character was a great add up but not used in a smart way.The fx is better than the first movie especially the villain ghost.Like the first part this movie is also filled with fun elements, sometimes the jokes feel artificial and false. Overall they are laughable but you feel like you have heard it before from part I. Luis character was definitely awful.In the end I felt like watching a light family comedy more than a superhero movie.PS. I watched most of the marvel movies at least twice but this is not going to be one of them."
920,10,"Loved it Wonderful combination of comedy, heart and sci-fi."
921,6,"An honest opinion from an MCU fan... I saw it yesterday in 3D, here's my review, I'll try to keep it as short as I can. Those are the main pros and cons of the film in my opinion. I'll start with the cons...Cons: a) This movie should've been called Wasp and the Ant-Man, not the other way around. Literally Ant-Man in this film is a comedy relief and nothing more. I suppose based on the trailers, I should've seen this coming. Wasp is doing exactly what you expect from a superhero with her powers, she's awesome, she's sexy, she's a bad ass... but Ant-Man, oh boy, where should I start? I don't want to spoil anything, so let's say that in his 5 or 10 minutes in the Captain America: Civil War, he kicked more ass than he did in this entire movie! Let's hope Anthony and Joe Russo will make up to him in the Avengers 4.b) The lack of a good male villain. Here's what I mean: While Ghost is a decent character (she desperately needed more screen time though), the male antagonist is a black market tech dealer. Why is this bad? Because that's the main reason Ant-Man is ""sitting in the back seat"" in this movie. The writers couldn't have Ant-Man and the Wasp both fighting against one (Ghost) without making it look repetitive or unfair, so they decided to let the Wasp do the dirty work. The sad thing is that they mentioned Goliath in the movie, he could be an excellent enemy for the giant-size Ant-Man, what a missed opportunity!c) If you expect in the action scenes to see superheroes fighting supervillains with their powers... they do, but not as much as you expect or want them to do. Unfortunately the major action sequences involving car chases with shrinking Hot-Wheels. If that's your cup of tea you'll loved it but personally I don't, not in a superhero movie.d) Too much comedy. Okay, I get it, after the dark tone of Infinity Wars they probably wanted something more ""marvelish"" from a comedic point of view, but in my opinion they went too far. Sometimes the comedy lasts too long or comes out in inappropriate moments, as a result, it interrupts the movie's pace.e) Distracting plot holes and ""convenient coincidences"". Here's a spoiler-free example (its from the first movie): They making a reference to the original Wasp who became sub-atomic in order to stop a nuclear missile... guys, if you become sub-atomic EVERYTHING around you will look the same, atoms everywhere! You cannot become sub-atomic and then start pulling out wires and plugs, you'll be too small for that! I know it's fantasy, sci-fi, or whatever, but it's too stupid! It's like breathing on the Moon or something.And now, the pros: a) The main plot. After the events of the first movie I suppose we all wanted to see Hank Pym reunite with his wife, Janet, and this is all about; Hank's quest to save her. Also we see a Scott Lang who respects the law and he's not anymore the thief of the first movie (even if he had good intentions). The first 15 minutes maybe are a little slow but overall the movie keeps you interested and you want to know what's going to happen next.b) The performances. All actors are great and believable, if I had to rate; I would say that Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly and Paul Rudd gave us a 9/10 performance. You can feel the chemistry between them and I'm pretty sure they had a great time while they shooting the film.c) The humor. I know I said they went too far with the comedy... and they did, but at least most of the jokes are good. The worst thing about overusing the element of comedy in a movie is when the jokes are bad, lame and cringy. Thankfully, this movie doesn't suffer from that. There are of course a few bad jokes here and there but those are the exception rather than the rule.d) The effects. That's not a surprise, the effects are awesome. I won't say much, it's everything you expect to see. Personally I was impressed by the excellent job they did by showing us the ""young"" Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer!e) Wasp is awesome. Now here's a thing: Some people saying this movie is another SJW feminist propaganda, I can understand why they believe that but I disagree. Hope Van Dyne is not a Mary sue, she's not Rey from Star Wars, period. She's a bad-ass as a superhero and a person, but this doesn't comes out of nowhere. We know she trained hard and she is clever thanks to her father's guidance. In the movies we see that she's not perfect, she's sensitive, she gets beaten, she makes mistakes, she apologizes, she depends on others. She's a flawed person, like any human, but she's also someone you can depend on.Final thoughts: Like so many other MCU fans, perhaps my expectations were too high after the Avengers - Trinity War; but I expected more from this film (at least from Ant-Man himself), it's not as good as the first Ant-Man. If you liked Thor - Ragnarok and Iron Man 3; you'll probably like this as well. Did I regret watching it? The answer is no. Would I pay to see it again in the theater? The answer is also no, nevertheless, I'll get the bluray, it deserves a place in my collection.Final verdict: 6/10. Not the best film in the world, but you should see it once in the theater for the visual experience. PS: It's definitely not a 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, those are Batman and Robin standards! But surely it's not an 8/10, 9/10, 10/10 either, those are Avengers - Infinity War standards."
922,1,"Ant sized entertainment. Ant Man and the wasp - another zany production from the house of running out of ideas. This is the sequel to the entertaining film Ant Man released in 2015 but none of the charm that worked in the previous is even barely present. Paul Rudd looks really bored and stiff. His facial expressions were at times abysmal. Good performers like Douglas , Laurence Fishburne and Walton Goggins are wasted as per marvel trends. Cast a great actor then throw him under the bus for some cheap laughs while poking fun at his own expense.A trite fest full of forced humor and out of place one liners is the best that this movie can offer. The vfx is passable in some parts while others like the ferry scene in the trailer is down right atrocious. I'm not even going to discuss the villain here as her intention and motivations doesn't make sense like the movie plot. The fight sequences are so lame and easily done that you don't even feel some excitement or thrill while watching. But hey you can't blame if you're watching a low budget garbage right? All the decent scenes were shown in the first trailer alone itself so there's nothing new to see. The only good parts were in the quantum realm and that's it. Head honcho Kevin Feige stated in an interview that they like to focus their movies on their heroes and villains don't matter. i guess without any moral/ social or ethical dilemma / stake or turning point in any story and it's characters can progress right ? It cannot and the movie itself is a glaring example of it. Not worth your time especially not IMAX or even 3D. Watch if you have some time and money to waste not spare."
923,7,"ANT-tagonizing Crime, One Movie at a Time Ant Man was a pleasant surprise for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, presenting a hero with a unique power in a film that was self-aware and knew its limits, being a fun, family-oriented blockbuster with genuine laughs and very creative action. Ant-Man and Wasp is exactly the same, just a lesser version of that, like the Diet Coke to regular, calorie-loaded but tastier Coke. The cast in this movie is what holds it together, every performance is solid, with especially high marks going to the overdue performance of Evangeline Lily as Wasp. Don't get me wrong, Paul Rudd is great as Ant-Man, but you can see the commitment flow off of Lily in her portrayal of one of Marvel's most classic heroines. She kicks butt with the enthusiasm of someone who's been waiting too long to do it. The supporting cast is hilarious, with Michael Pena, T.I. and Randall Park providing some firm laughs, and some great visuals in the subatomic world. Where it's really weak is in the story's main conflict and lack of a truly threatening villain. The newcomer Ghost has interesting and challenging powers, but her character is almost overly sympathetic, and Walton Goggins, while a good sleazy side-villain, doesn't really push the heroes either. The movie really needed someone to truly threaten the Pym/Lang families and come across as more dangerous. Perhaps a true villain who was manipulating Ghost could've added to it. The comedy is great, but there needed to be more action and fight scenes, especially with Ant-Man and Wasp using their powers together. There's glimpses of this, but after the mindblowing action seen in Infinity War, there needed to be more on display here. It does however open up some major potential storylines and elements with a few subtle scenes and the post-credit scenes, so don't miss this if you're strongly devoted to the MCU storyline. Otherwise, if you're not a MCU-devout or an especially big Ant-Man fan, you can wait to see this one."
924,10,I liked how short it was with all the action in to one I think this movie is a Comedy / action movie. And I thought it was really friendly and funny movie that you can relax to and watch it with your family.
925,8,"Great Sequel I saw ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", starring Paul Rudd-The Anchorman movies, Forgetting Sarah Marshall; Evangeline Lilly-The Hobbit movies, Freddy vs Jason; Michael Douglas-Last Vegas, One Night at McCool's; Hannah John_Kamen-Tomb Raider_2018, Game of Thrones_tv and Michelle Pfeiffer-Mother!, Batman Returns. This is a great sequel to the 2015 Ant-Man and it starts with Paul/Scott Lang on house arrest, after getting into trouble working with the Avengers, back in the civil war-The Captain America one. He is even wearing an ankle bracelet that goes off if he leaves his front yard. Michael/Hank Pym and his daughter Evangeline/Hope Van Dyne are working on finding Michelle/Janet Van Dyne, who if you remember from the first movie, is lost somewhere in the Quantum Realm-a sub atomic shrunken universe. Guess whose help they need to find her? Yep, Paul. You have to have a villain in the movie and this time it's Hannah/The Ghost. FYI: In the comics, The Ghost was a male and he never fought Ant-Man. He was usually a pain in the keister to Iron Man. Hannah has phasing powers-she can turn immaterial and walk through walls-and she knows how to fight pretty good. There is a lot of humor, along with the super heroics, and it ends with a little cliff hanger for Paul, to be continued in the Avengers:Infinity War sequel, I'm guessing. Stan Lee has his usual cameo and there are 2 scenes as the end credits start. The first one shows us that this movie does take place during the same time as the Avengers:Infinity War. The second one is just plain comical. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
926,8,"An enjoyable and entertaining sequel I didn't have high expectations for an Ant-man sequel, but this one delivered some entertainment fit for the entire family. Decent humor, fun action and a good story made this film enjoyable. CGI was decent as was the action. It's an 8/10 from me."
927,8,"Somehow Refreshing I had a very good time with this movie; sure there are typical Marvel shortcomings, but they are quickly followed by moments that remind us why we love Marvel movies.After some expositional dialogue to explain where we are at in the timeline of the grander narrative, the writers throw a joke at us in acknowledgement of what they are doing. This happens a few times in this film which actually didn't bug me as much as I thought it would given the light hearted nature of the film.The shrinking and growing fight scenes, car chases, and tom foolery were fun to be a part of and the VFX team had a field day with being able to play in that universe.Talking character, I think that Ghost was underutilized as a force of antagonism and I never quite got an accurate read on Bill. The payoff between the two of them was unclear as well. There was just some unnatural moments between their story lines, although I thought it was effective subplot that could have been explored more.Very normal for about 80% of comedy landed with only a few scenes where it felt forced and some ""ant"" puns that were cringe-worthy.The story felt like a game of hot potato with a shrunken building thats furniture must be bolted very securely to the floor. It was a bit hodge-podgy but all the key moments seemed to be there. This is probably indicative of deadlines in trying to push this film out the door. The bad guys got theirs and the good guys were successful, but honestly that simplicity didn't bother me.The Marvel Archetype structure prevails!"
928,7,"1st one was better overall, but this one explains more of Ant-Man's background Overall, it's not bad. Felt like (as did the first one) this was on the edge of a stand alone film. Really doesn't have a connection to the MCU until a certain point (spoiler below). Has more of the Ant-Man background tale in it (excluding certain parts which made Scott Lang the primary character instead of Hank Pym). Number of references Marvel fans will get.Could have focused a lot less on the villain ""Ghost"". There were times it felt like the movie was more about the Villains than Ant-Man and Wasp. Michael Peña and his cronies are more hilarious in their roles in AM2 than AM1. Stan Lee has a hilarious cameo (as always).Spoiler: Mid-credit scene ties Ant-Man into Infinity War. And yes, it's painful to watch.Spoiler: the post credit scene is pointless. It was partially featured on a trailer (think big ant)."
929,10,Blockbuster! Phenomenal! One've the best Marvel movies yet! Antman is the funnier version of Ironman
930,7,"Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) Marvel has had a hell of a year. Between the massive success of Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, we get a third MCU film of the much more light hearted sequel to Ant-Man. This time though the Wasp (played by Evangeline Lilly) is taking equal hero plaudits. I had re-watched Ant-Man this past week and liked it a lot more on its most recent viewing. It wasn't the tip top of MCU films but was enjoyable for being different and having Paul Rudd as a superhero. I don't think the sequel is as entertaining as the first but it is still an enjoyable ride.The film explores the quest of Hank Pym and his daughter, Hope, to find Janet Van Dyne, a superhero who went subatomic years ago and has been lost in the quantum realm. The key to her whereabouts are in Scott Lang's head. However, a mysterious woman named Ghost disrupts their mission as she wants to use the energy Janet has procured in the quantum realm to bring stability to her own being. Sounds like a lot going on, and that's definitely the case with this film.The film has much more going on; more moving pieces. There are two groups of villains and multiple plot lines not as straightforward as the first film. The film does have some funny moments but I don't think all of them actually land. There isn't a whole lot of Michelle Pfeiffer in the film either, a bit of a waste. Also felt like Ava Starr/Ghost was a stale villain with minimal or ineffective characterization.The stakes feel low in this effort, which I see as more of a good thing. The latest Avengers film was darker than any MCU film we've seen and we needed to see a silly, light, and comedic follow up and that's exactly what this film is. The action scenes (big and small) are as fun as ever. I really like Evangeline Lilly i a more prominent heroic role. Think both Ant-Man and Wasp were able to share the spot light well. Also, think this film series is still some of the best stuff from Michael Douglas in a while.We have been spoiled by so many great Marvel films recently that this seems like a not as remarkable effort. Its a worthy sequel to the first film although I found myself being more invested in the plot and humor of the first film. I will say this, after the events of the latest Avengers the entire franchise is heading in a gripping direction and I'm excited as ever for what comes next.6.5/10"
931,7,"Man, did you see what that ant just did? Just a good time out to the movies. Not epic, but certainly enjoyable."
932,8,Great It was great but keep saying Michael Peña is the key to fun in this movies I loved him. Lol and the movie was great. I don't know why Scott was forgiven after the civil war but not Steve and the others it was good
933,9,"A fun MCU film that lights up the franchise but it is a little bit the same when it comes to story. Ant-Man and the Wasp (4.5 out of 5 stars).Ant-Man and the Wasp bring another fun marvel superhero into the addition. With bringing back Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly fun chemistry and humor. And another fun filled tiny superhero that brings some crazy exciting action. Also, a fresh villain Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) which does turn things into a new direction when it comes to bad guys which does give some emotional depth with the character. After marvels last film Avengers: Infinity War that turned things into a dark direction. Ant-Man does light up the franchise once again with the characters charm, humor, and having a simple plot that does not focus on threat against humanity.The plot follows after the events of Captain America Civil War. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is house arrest after helping Captain America. He only has a few days left with his sentence. Until, he has a dream of when he was in the Quantum realm in the first movie. And he sees visions of Janet van Dyne ( Michelle Pfeiffer) who is Hope (Evangeline Lilly) mother. Hank (Michael Douglas) is trying to build a new technology that can try to locate Janet and to extract her back to the real world. When Ava/Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) is struggling to live after exposure with the experiment. She is after the same technology that can sabotage their mission to rescue Janet.The plot was simple and more focused on the emotionality of Hope and Hank wanting to bring Janet back home. The film spends too much time with Hope and Hank trying to figure out how to build this technology of entering the quantum realm. Ghost is that type of villain were you can build an emotional connection too. She is not hellbent on destroying the world but only trying to save herself. And will stop at nothing to do so. She is the highlight of the movie as her character can walk through walls and people. And appear out of nowhere. Hannah John-Kamen was great as the character.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are back and great as ever. As they team up to fight bad guys. The car chases are fun. As the technology can shrink their cars into a hot wheel size going up against the bad guys black suvs. Michael Pena was fun as Luis and he does share another fun storytelling when he is being interrogated from an arms dealer (Walter Goggins).The visual effects are great. The quantum realm setting was stunning and beautiful to look at. As characters focus more time being in there to search for Janet. The climatic car chases with Scott and Hope escaping with the technology while Ghost and Sonny (Walton Goggins) are after them.Overall, Ant-Man and the Wasp is a really good film. If you loved the first movie, you will definitely love this one. Not the best Marvel movie. But it has its fun crazy humor and exciting creative action sequences that takes place being tiny and large. The characters are a lot of fun. And the villain is an interesting one that does make you want to see more. Also, there is a mid credit scene that is an important set up."
934,6,"Good movie...Marvel jokes not working anymore. The movie is good, all the special effects are really good. It keeps you entertained the entire movie.In fact, I liked it better than the first one. That said, I hope these are the last Marvel movies with this ""comedian"" formula and they change it for the next phase , because it really got so ""meh"" at this point that is not funny anymore..."
935,9,"I knew how it would end This is the sequel to ""Ant-Man"" and I admit I'm probably expressing some bias because I'm a big fan of shrinking movies. I'll always remember ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"" which had ants in it. This movie features tons of great jokes and action scenes. My only complaint is that the villain was a little shallow. She's still not bad. Keep up with the truth serum jokes.The special effects are quite nice. The plot is that Scott is trying to find a way to travel to the quantum level to find Janet, who disappeared years ago. I am kind of wondering how she was able to survive being there all that time. You know, what did she eat or drink on that level? Sadly, the scene during the credits shows us all the characters except Scott have been killed by Thanos as alluded to in ""Avengers: Infinity War"". Talk about overkill."
936,8,"Just plain fun! Perfect, lighter themed show for in between the Infinity Wars I really enjoyed this film, just like I did the first ant-man. The comedic relief is just as good as the first. Yes the villain is not super rememberable, but I think that's exactly what they were aiming for. All in all, any marvel fan will have a great time watching Ant Man and the Wasp"
937,8,"NF Ant-Man And The Wasp was really fun after the depressing ending to Infinity War. This movie like a majority of the other Marvel films is its own film. Until the very end it connects and answers where, Ant-Man and the Wasp were during Infinity War. Which did good things for this film and my excitment for the future films. Paul Rudd played his part perfectly. They had some extremely funny scenes when the first Wasp"
938,9,"A Fun & Funny Ride A few months ago, 'Avengers: Infinity War' shocked and forced a tear or two. 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is here to wipe away those tears. A lighter movie is exactly what was needed after the devastation caused in Infinity War. When 'Ant-Man' was released in 2015 the expectations were minimal. A lot of people, myself included, had never heard of the tiny superhero. It felt like a small (pun not intended) release from Marvel Studios but one that ended up being a thoroughly enjoyable flick, much like this sequel.Remember the mess our heroes created in 'Captain America: Civil War'? Well, Scott Lang is left dealing with the consequences of running off, or rather flying off, to help Cap and Co. Hope van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym's lives are also in disarray thanks to Ant-Man Jr's (Dr. Pym is the original) actions. But when the team reunites for a new mission the fun flies! Literally. After struggling with her father's decision to make Scott the new Ant-Man in the previous film, Hope has now become a mighty fine superhero in her own right. Together the duo cause a ruckus, deal with some hurt, and do what all good heroes do- wear cool suits.I would describe this movie as a superhero comedy. It really is all fun and games albeit with an emotional core. Director Peyton Reed has kept the pace brisk and the tone cheerful. He knows his heroes will eventually save the day so might as well make the ride funny. And it is very funny! Humor is generously used throughout the film even in times of crisis. Tense sequences are broken up with quirky one-liners and the characters and actors seem to be having a blast on screen.This is the first Marvel movie to feature a female superhero in the title- the Wasp. Badass and ready to get the job done, Evangeline Lilly is pitch perfect. Hope has been preparing for her moment to shine and Ms. Lilly makes sure she does. I can't imagine a better cast Ant-Man than Paul Rudd. He's hilarious and genuine. I make a lot of mistakes, he says but you don't really blame him because he's such a lovable goofball. Michael Douglas brings a certain dignity to Hank and the film while Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful addition to the cast. On the flip side, Hannah John-Kamen isn't particularly memorable as Ghost. It's a half-baked character that didn't really work for me...but I moved on pretty quickly. Mainly because Michael Peña is a hoot! I'm glad he was given ample screen time since I laughed every time he opened his mouth. Serum or no serum, that's the truth.Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp deal with personal struggles and battles. For the characters it isn't about saving the world, as most of the other superheroes are doing, it's about what's happening closer to home. It's a unique approach since the stakes aren't earth shattering for humanity; there are plenty of others dealing with that. Here you laugh and have a good time with likable characters, some slick action, and impressive graphics. Mission accomplished.I shouldn't need to tell you this but stay for the mid credits scene; it all ties together.stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com"
939,7,Enjoyable Pleasant fun movie. Good cast. Fun banter between characters. Very likable. Story basic but entertaining.
940,10,What a Awesome Summer Movie Awesome plot. Awesome cast. Awesome movie. It's a must see film. What a great summer movie.
941,8,"A good source of comic relief following the severity of the ending of Avengers: Infinity War Ant-Man and the Wasp is the sequel to 2015's Ant-Man and the twentieth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it is a fun, light-hearted entry in the MCU and a good source of comic relief following the severity of the ending of Avengers: Infinity War.Following the events of Captain America: Civil War, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is placed under house arrest for his involvement in the fight with the Avengers in Germany. As he is approaching the end of his arrest, Scott is kidnapped by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) who task him with helping them in finding Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), the long missing wife of Hank and the mother of Hope, who is lost deep in the quantum realm.Delivering just the right amount of humour and action, Ant-Man and the Wasp is exactly what MCU audiences need after viewing the infamously dark ending of Avengers: Infinity War. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly have solid chemistry and each scene they were together was highly enjoyable. Michael Douglas was implemented well into the story as Dr Hank Pym, proving to be a great straight man for many of Scott's comedic foils. However, it is Michael Peña as Luis who once again steals the movie in every scene he is in, often with his funny exaggerated stories. The only major issue is that very little felt at stake in this film, but this is likely because Thanos is still meant to be seen as the biggest threat to the entire MCU and everything else simply pales in comparison. For those wondering why Ant-Man was absent in Avengers: Infinity War, the post-credits scene should shed some light on what was going on.I rate it 8/10"
942,9,"In Marvel We Trust You used to go to to a Superhero movie already knowing that the hero would win, the bad guy would lose and that was it. Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War changed that old game, making the movies less predictible and this new movie takes full advantage of that.Tho it has a slow start there is a lot of references galore for a Marvel nerd like me in the first act, but the third act is one unstoppable force of emotions like I have rarely seen in a Comic Book Movie.The supporting cast includes heavy hitters like Laurence Fishburne and Walter Goggins, but the main cast really shines in this movie including the main antagonist, a superpowered force to be wreckoned with masterfully played by Hannah John-Kamen.There is not much I can say about it without spoling it, but I will say Marvel Studios outdid themselves with this movie, which is by far superior than the first Ant-Man and it takes the comedy really serious and the jokes are up to task with amazing action pieces, in case you are wondering: Yes, it is all connected, stay for the post-credits scene.I am shocked on how great this film is and I might even put it in my Top 5 MCU movies so far. I give it 9 out of 10.Ant-Man and the Wasp are a great cinematic team, I cannot wait to watch it again."
943,7,"The most interesting Character Is Ghost!Well the movie isnt bad, not more bad or better than Ant-Man. Have seen the first one because I was curious how they turn the story and the character Ant-Man to an movie. Suprised good and enjoyable both movies. Evangeline Lilly was excatly the Wasp i wanted to see. I little bit more Wasp than Hope would have been good I think.With all characters we know from the last Ant-Man Movie and all the gags was Ghost the most interesting Charakter. I would have wished to see more of her, more and better story, background and a better contrast to the gags.Absolute out of place was Goggins and his team, same horrible like in Tomb Raider. Wounder who is always casting thise terrible actor."
944,8,"Entertaining Movie!! I am not a comic book movie fan but went to see this anyway....great action, great special effects, had some funny lines, strong cast.....all around a good movie to see on a big screen."
945,8,"A Breezy Follow-Up in the Grand Scheme of Things Pretty much anyone out there who had the chance to see Avengers: Infinity War knows that this franchise had nowhere to go but smaller (literally) after the events of that movie. With the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp looming around the corner, I found myself quite intrigued in returning to these characters and having a much more relaxing theatre experience. What I'll start this off by stating is if you didn't care very much for the first Ant-Man film, then this addition probably won't do too much to win you over, but I had a blast with the first film. For myself, this film may even be slightly better than its predecessor, due to the furthering of characters and giving itself a solid place in this franchise as a whole. If you enjoy following the Marvel Cinematic Universe, here's why I believe you're in for another fun experience at the movies.Being a direct sequel to the first film, but taking place after the events of Captain America: Civil War, this movie finds a nice slot to fit into this universe, without coming within close range of Avengers: Infinity War. Discovering that Janet Van Dyne is possibly still alive in the Quantum Realm, Hank and Hope have been working on a plan/machine for years in order to travel there and retrieve her. Scott, being on odd terms with them, eventually teams up to assist them in their endeavors. With the addition of the villain Ghost and quite a few secondary characters, this film never loses a beat in terms of energy and pacing. I can't quite dive into other plot details without ruining the film, so let's dive into one of the biggest aspects that make the films so enjoyable: the comedy.If for nothing else, I think your trip to the theatre will be well worth it for the laughs alone. Not just for a superhero comedy, but I honestly haven't laughed so hard at the theatre in a while. There are a few sequences throughout this film (with a standout scene taking place in a grade school) that almost had me in tears laughing. The way they use the shrinking technology in certain instances here is absolutely brilliant. The visual gags are what bring these movies to another level and Ant-Man and the Wasp is no exception to that notion. On top of the humour, these characters are just as likeable as always.Michael Douglas is very solid in his role as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty great in the short screen time she receives, and Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly's chemistry is something that just leaps off the screen, but I was sort of fascinated with the character of Ava/Ghost (the villain) played by actress Hannah John-Kamen. When this film begins, she seems like a throwaway villain in order to have a longer running time for the movie, but her backstory is quite strong and I felt that she was one of the stronger characters that this film had to offer.In the end, it's hard to get into specifics when you're trying to stay secretive about a film like this, but I have no trouble in recommending this movie to everyone. It's a comedy for people who crave good humour, a solid action flick for the junkies out there, and a solidly written superhero movie that fits in nicely within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, there are quite a few plot holes and some of the humour goes a little too far, especially in a few of the dramatic moments, but this movie is just a great ride to take at the movies, plain and simple. On top of having a blast with this movie, there is a sequence throughout the credits that needs to be seen, so stick around. I can't wait to see more of these characters."

947,9,"Appropriately named Ant-Man and the Wasp is the correct name, because this is more of a team up movie than the previous entry. I'll start by saying that Evangeline Lilly's Wasp is a badass. Her fight scenes used the shrinking ability to maximum effect. The story is simple, yet compelling. It had a lot of heart, and a great ending. There are essentially 3-villains, 2 you can empathize with, the third a run of the mill bad guy, but due to the handling of the non run of the mills bad guys, I thought Marvel nailed it. The tone was hilarious from beginning to end, there is a middle section where it gets really serious, but then is saved by Paul Rudd, who knows how to handle these types of movies due to his success w/ I Love You Man and This is 40. The sight-gags had us rolling, there is a scene where Ant-Man's suit is malfunctioning and we couldn't stop laughing. On a side note, it feels LOTR-esque the way they handle the size and proportions. Lastly, Michael Pena tops himself as the scene stealer with his frantic delivery. He's hilarious. Lastly Lastly, I really enjoyed Randall Park's back and forth with Paul Rudd, it made for some of the best lines in the movie. Overall this is a perfect movie for post Inifinty War, in tone and scale. You also get some explanation for their absence during the fights w/ the Black Order, but it's not 100% convincing."
948,4,"It takes two to make a thing go horribly horribly wrong I didn't care about this movie at all. After so many blockbusters this summer and most of them being mediocre or just average, they all just mesh together in your head. Besides, Ant Man 2? I like Ant Man quite a bit, but we're right off the coattails of Infinity War, where, you know, *half the universe ceased to exist*. It doesn't matter what happens in this movie. It's not gonna be as epic as that. More importantly, it's entirely possible that the whole movie won't matter. Shocker, I'm right.There's some good in here. For super hero movies these days have one problem that's started to bug me a bit recently; the heroes never use their powers as much as they can. The best action scene in Infinity War between Doctor Strange and Thanos is the big exception from this problem, since Strange is using the full power of the Sorcerer Supreme, and Thanos actually uses the four Infinity Stones he has. But most of the other action scenes from these superhero movies these days really struggle from this. They usually have like one great moment of super stuff and that's it. This movie really takes advantage of the shrinking concept. Lots of action of shrinking things, and lots of the Ghost using her power. There's a moment in the movie (you can see it in the trailer) where Ghost phases through a car and kicks a dude off a motorcycle. And she does similar things to that the whole movie.At times the movie can be pretty funny. Most of Ant Man was a comedy, so they kinda ramped that up here too, along with the shrinking concept. However, this leads to a big problem with the movie, so I'll get back to that.Uhh... that's it.Remember how Edgar Wright was gonna direct the original, but before creative differences happened, he helped write the movie? Maybe that's why the movie was really funny at times, because there was a very creative person watching over it. But here there's none of that. You get a really bland story with no creative edge or super hilarious moments. There's some funny stuff in here, but when a joke falls on its face, it really doesn't bode well. Sometimes there's a joke that lands, immediately followed by a joke that falls flat, and then the scene ends.All the effects work is bad. I don't blame them, with how much money and effort going to Infinity War, the movie was never gonna get the best effects team. But I at least expected better effects than this. A lot of the time the effects just boggle the mind. The ending shot with Hank and his wife looked like the worst green possible and the worst effects work possible. There was very little effort to make this movie look good, as a good chunk of the time it also looks very ugly. Maybe it was the way it was lit, maybe it was a combination of the effects and green screen, but it just looked ugly a lot of the time.Ghost was pretty lame. While her powers and backstory were kinda neat, I barely understood her motivation until she actually tried to execute her plan. She wants to use the power of Hank's wife stuck in the Quantum Realm to save herself from death by her own powers. Okay, but you and the science guy you're working with both know that Hank's wife (Michelle Pfeiffer, in case you were wondering why her name is attached to this movie) is a brilliant woman who could probably create a miracle cure in ten minutes. The science guy even says this right at the end when they try and do this. Besides if you're gonna die in a couple of days why do it right now? Something about the wife being lost forever inside the realm, despite her even being find-able in this movie being total coincidence after thirty something years. I don't really get it. At least she's slightly better than the other bad guy in this movie, Evil Mc. Badguy who just wants to make money. He sucked.This movie doesn't matter at all. We all know that half the universe ceased to exist, and we're just gonna have this semi-prequel? No. It doesn't work like this at all. Many, many times during the moment I was chuckling to myself thinking, ""what if the snap happened right this instant?"" They save the snap for the end, don't worry. But it also renders the characters we just cared about for around two hours pointless, since they're now dust. That Wasp lady? Dust. The character we spent the whole movie saving? Dust. I was fine when Infinity War did this because the characters they killed weren't just that movie only. We knew the characters there for way longer than two hours. It's not like Infinity War just set up Matt Damon's Ghost Rider (plz Marvel just give the fans what we want) and snap! killed him. The characters that died there were important, and had influence, and made lots of money. We just spent the whole movie saving Michelle and in the post credits scene snap! Dead. It all doesn't matter.I really hate to say it. I really wanted to love this movie. But I have to say, this is the first Marvel movie since the first Ant Man you could reasonably skip (for now at least- he'll be back by the End Game). It's around as bad as Thor The Dark World, which is the worst of the worst in terms of Marvel. I didn't like it at all, which is a serious shame. But this movie really needed some fixes, and in particular, a different release date. Don't release your dumb Ant Man sequel less than three months after Infinity. Release it after all the hype dies down, I'd say November. Hopefully Marvel looks at their release schedule and fixes their bloated moments to come, mainly Captain Marvel going almost immediately into End Game, and then that almost immediately going into Far From Home. This is the kinda stuff that'll ruin it for everyone.So in short, skip this one folks. You're not missing much."
949,9,"For Such Tiny Heroes, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is a Huge Success! After seeing 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' in theaters I have to admit that it's been a pretty good year for Marvel at the movies. Marvel studios itself has already released 'Black Panther' and 'Avengers: Infinity War,' and another one of their heroes got a sequel from Fox. With all these Marvel movies in 2018, ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' had a lot to overcome in order to be even slightly memorable. Luckily, the film is much more than just slightly memorable, it's probably the most fun I've had at the movies so far this summer.Paul Rudd is back as Scott Lang a former criminal turned accidental hero. Scott's had a bit of a rough time as of late and is coming to the end of two years under house arrest. He's kept on a tight leash and is just trying to keep his head down until he's free to walk the streets again. That is until Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) comes knocking on his door again. Reluctantly Scott is sucked back into becoming Ant-Man in order to help Hope and her father (Michael Douglas) on a mission to save her mother and outsmart the villains hot on their tails (Walton Goggins and Hannah John-Kamen). Oh, and the FBI wants to put them all behind bars. Needless to say, this is Ant-Man's biggest adventure yet.Unfortunately, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is a Marvel movie that starts to rely too much on people having seen the other films of the MCU. It makes a number of references to 'Captain America: Civil War' and Scott Lang's involvement in the events of that film. Of course, it also helps to have seen the first 'Ant-Man' movie too so you know who these characters are and what in the heck that Quantum Realm is (then again, I still don't really even know what it is). Then, of course, there's also the tie into 'Avengers: Infinity War.' While I appreciate Marvel trying to tie all their film together into one epic universe, the fact that you have to sit through over six hours of movies in order to truly grasp all the nuances in their newest film is a bit daunting. Personally, it's not an issue for me, but I figured I would offer a heads up to the more casual Marvel movie fans out there.So, why wasn't Ant-Man in 'Infinity War?' Well, I'm not going to completely spoil that for you, other than to say that you should definitely stick around through the credits to find out what he was up to. My theory is that Paul Rudd and Chris Pratt together in one movie would have been one joker too many. In a lot of ways, they are very similar heroes. Of course, Pratt is one of the heavy hitters in Hollywood right now, but I have to say that Rudd plays the fish out of water hero much better overall. Scott Lang is pretty much a professional screw up despite the fact that he's utterly brilliant. The fact that he has no idea what he's doing though, and fully acknowledges it, makes him one of the better heroes in the MCU right now. I mean, there's no way Ant-Man on his own could compete with Captain America, Thor or Iron Man? Well, you make him the most human of them all and that's 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' gets right.Marvel has seriously been upping their game with their female heroes. They've come a long way from just having Black Widow in their ranks and have some truly badass ladies from Valkyrie ('Thor: Ragnarok') to Okoye ('Black Panther'). Now Evangeline Lilly's Wasp gets to join them. In fact, she's so badass in this movie that it feels a lot more like Ant-Man is her sidekick. While we got to see some pretty awesome uses of shrinking powers in the first film, but this movie really ups the ante. The Wasp manages to take groups of baddies apart in absolutely astounding displays of grace and brutality. Honestly, the men of the MCU are going to have to watch out at this rate, because the women are proving to be much cooler as of late.What makes 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' really shine though is that it is absolutely side-splitting. Of course, Paul Rudd is well known for his endearing charisma and sense of humor on the big screen, but this time around he's got plenty of other capable comedians working with him. Luckily audience favorite Luis (Michael Peña) is back with his comrades (T.I. and David Dastmalchian), and they're all back in great form. Joining them though is one of my favorite supporting actors, Randall Park, joins them and practically steals the show. He plays an FBI agent who is essentially a huge puppy dog throwing around words like ""malarkey"" and ""dickens."" All together, they round out a cast that manages to make 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' a comedy to rival even 'Guardians of the Galaxy' in the MCU.While 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' might be a comedy at heart, it is still very much an action film. Director Peyton Reed manages to make small powerful in some outstanding uses of the shrinking powers Ant-Man posses. There are car chases, fight sequences, and even a few death-defying stunts. Altogether, it feels like this sequel really embraces the potential that the original laid out. Best of all 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' feels like it steps outside the mold that most Marvel movies feel like they're vacuum sealed into these days. Sure, it's an action comedy like so many of them, but it's just a ton of fun and doesn't feel quite like an all-out superhero movie at heart. So, if you're looking for a great movie to see in theaters, be sure to check out this awesome flick."
950,7,"The Wasp and the Ant Man Where Infinity War went for big ambitions and didn't fully hit the mark (I know I'm likely in the minority on that, don't care), this aimed (adjust tie) smaller and succeeded at what it set out to do completely. I find it hard to be too harsh on these Ant-Man movies; they're like likable puppy dogs, though they are not without the typical Marvel set-backs like a lukewarm villain (or I should say the writing isn't so blah as much as the performance is like it should be in a CW show up against the rest of this cast) and some clunky exposition and mumbo jumbo involving power levels in the Quantum Realm).But the third act set piece chase in San Francisco is basically like a much, much funnier Inception with a good sprinkling of... The car chase from The Dead Pool comes to mind (not that one, the Eastwood one). It's all kids stuff, or I should say more correctly family friendly stuff, but maybe after dumb and/or dark malarkey like Jurassic World 2 and Sicario 2 this hit the spot as needed light, occasionally trippy sci fi entertainment. It's not one of the best of Marvels 20(!) movies in 10 years, but it's among the breeziest and funniest."
951,6,"Plot is A bit lost in the quantum realm I enjoyed this but was left frustrated. Original cast did a fantastic job, the stars of which are Lilly, Paul Rudd and Pena. Sadly that's about it, every new member of the cast is hollow and at times almost pointless. Ghost is actually really annoying. Overall it has a lot more positive moments and is really good in parts but never hits the hieghts that we know marvel can reach. Not the worst marvel movie but by all means not the best."
952,8,"Calm you down after Infinity War After a massive shock in Avengers: Infinity War, many Marvel fans try to put themselves together to stay and follow the universe. Ant-Man and the Wasp tends ""hold"" you for a second before you get caught by another massive strike in Captain Marvel. Paul Rudd shows his comedic sides more this time, and I think it's hilarious especially when he got the ""antenna"". His chemistry with Evangeline Lilly is growing bit by bit. Michael Pena and Randall Park also give fresh jokes that succesfully ""punch"" at the right moment. Don't forget how cute Cassie Lang can be in the future. And yep, for every single Marvel head out there, your question about its timeline will be answered in the mid-credit scene. Wait for it, it brings back the (awful) memory. 8/10"
953,8,"My Spy Family! The film is a light snack. Spy spirit, a lot of references to the shows and films of Marvel. The main villain is not. There is a criminal group and a character who wants to achieve his goal in life. The film is weaker than the ""Black Panther"" and ""Spider-Man, The Homecoming"". The film for family viewing, weekend."
954,2,"Yawn. From the opening scene, this movie was worse than could have imagined. The relationship between Paul Rudd and his on screen daughter is so cheesy, like Brady Bunch cheesy. Michael Douglas obviously didn't get the memo that he's supposed to be the straight, serious scientist because he cracks jokes the whole time. The romantic subplot between Antman and the Wasp was a bore. The presence of the villains seemed just a necessary cog to propel the action scenes/use cool CGI.It was a waste of good actors because Michael Douglas, Paul Rudd and Randall Park are all excellent usually. Park does have some good moments but honestly, you always see the punchline being set up from a mile off. I went to the bathroom halfway through just to have a break. There's nothing more cringy than a movie full of people all trying too hard to be funny."
955,6,"Very light on plot but watchable ANT-MAN AND THE WASP, for good or bad, steers clear of heavy plot elements. Unfortunately, the film also suffers from its lack of a strong villain.The main plot for this outing with Scott Lang and the Pyms is a quest to rescue Hank Pym's long-lost wife from the quantum world where she's been trapped for the past 30 years. Two main groups are standing in the way of this goal, and they are a jilted ex-SHIELD operative named Ghost and a shady group of gangster-types who've been supplying Hank Pym with black market tech. The story takes place over the last three days of Scott's house arrest for his activities during the events of CIVIL WAR and the battle at the airfield.This movie is somewhat unusual in its design regarding which hero is the focus of the plot. Since this is the sequel to ANT-MAN, I expected Scott Lang to be the main character, but as the film is written, Hope fills the role of the main character better. She has the most to lose if they fail to rescue her mother, and she also ends up kicking the most bad-guy tail. I'm not sure if the writing was done this way on purpose or by accident. Scott ends up functioning more as a sidekick in most of the film.The other unusual writing choice is the film's lack of a real villain. The greasy gangster types cause trouble but act more as generic bad guys. Ghost was the logical choice for lead villain, but she never makes it into true villain territory and remains a misguided character trying to find a cure for her affliction. This villain problem weakened the film immensely. The movie ends up with a fairly ""meh"" plot and some of the dialog is clunky and far too on-the-nose, but it's watchable."
956,7,"Kind of, dry This movie, was, bland. It had no real point per say. Sure, there were a few jokes thrown in, none of which actually made me laugh, so you can scratch comedic off the list. Visually stunning? More like visually-normal. In other words, there where no VFX that made me go, wow, I've never seen anything like this before. So, I guess you can scratch that off the list, too. Dialogue? Well, let's just say the quantum this and quantum that pretty much sums up 99% of the movie's script. Acting? Pretty normal for a Marvel film. No outstanding roles or anything. Overall, it was just, ok. Nothing great about it, but, it certainly wasn't Billy Owens either. Will I buy this movie? Hell no. But, I'm seeing it again in IMAX 3D just to get the ""full"" experience, though, I don't really want to watch it again."
957,6,"A well entertaining flick. Antman and the Wasp is director Peyton Reeds follow up to his 2015 film Antman. Now even back in the day I had my reserves of these installments into the Mcu. Especially so after orginal director Edgar Wright was released from the project over creative differences. With that said I was glad to find myself wrong with how much I enjoyed the first outing and the second. Now I well admit I didn't find Antman and the Wasp as good as the first but still had a fun experience with it, along side with my wife. Some of the jokes came out a lil forced. A little bit too much exposition for certain aspects of the film. And a couple of scenes that felt to drag a tad long. But with a fine cast, a entertaining story. With a mid credit stinger to satisfy any of you marvel fans. (Especially after Infinity War) I would say this is a flick that does it job well. I give Antman and the Wasp 6/10"
958,9,"Loved the 1st. Wasn't sure what to expect from a sequel set after Infinity War but I was pleasantly surprised! After the events of Infinity War, knowing that I would be watching a movie that took place before the events made me skeptical about whether or not I would enjoy this movie. Ant-Man and the Wasp is a film that as a standalone would be amazing. The synergy between the actors and actresses was perfect. Scott;s daughter is as sweet as she was in the last film. I am glad she got more screen time. Luis steals every scene he is in. The entire security team play a great Pips to his Gladys Knight. The action scenes were done very well. I live n Atlanta and I visit SF on business so even though I knew where the scenes were, the switching was seamless on the action scenes. Loved the car scenes and the fight scenes as well. It's just a charming movie. Funny. Heartwarming. Action Packed. The perfect film to make you forget that half of everyone in the Universe disappeared...."
959,4,"We're Back to the ""Alright"" Marvel Movie Blueprint It's burdensome to come off of the colossal success of both Black Panther and Infinity War, two films that took a more serious and mature route in terms of the MCU's direction. This can make Ant-Man and the Wasp feel like a illustration of refreshment, but also one of a curse due to its ""simplistic yet guilty"" formula. Yes, it's perfectly enjoyable to watch and mildly humorous, but at what cost? We're back to the typical, forgettable, cliche superhero formula directed towards the lesser, more bland category of Marvel's many entries. If I'm being completely honest, it's starting to become ever so exhausting. (Verdict: C+)"
960,9,"No Magnifying Glass For This Ant Marvel has a habit of making sequels that far outdo what came before, and Ant-Man and the Wasp is no exception. If the first Ant-Man movie was a period at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, then this new one follows Infinity War with a loud exclamation point. The whole crew returns, with both Evangeline Lily and Michael Peña notably having much more to do this time around. Some fresh faces are introduced to the Marvel Universe as well in the form of Lawrence Fishburne, Walton Goggins, and most importantly Hannah John-Kamen as by far the most unique villain the MCU has given us (yes, finally another female villain!), which is especially surprising and refreshing after Corey Stoll's more stereotypical run as the Yellowjacket. Director Peyton Reed delivers a screenplay that loves to dial the intensity all the way up to eleven, yet still thankfully has plenty of room for laughs (like what is probably Stan Lee's funniest cameo yet) in-between a few good edge-of-your-seat moments that will have you peeking between your fingers to make sure everyone's still alright. It's no Infinity War, but Ant-Man and the Wasp proves that Marvel still has plenty of big tricks hidden up Scott Lang's tiny sleeves."

Hope (Lilly) and Hank (Michael Douglas) are on a quest themselves, but while doing this, strive to push past the boundary established form mistakes past. It's heartwarming, cute, and surprisingly deeper than expected, but doesn't divert from the story to make the point, rather integrating this into all the tales. It works well and develops a crew you want to follow this journey through.Good Main Villain: Marvel baddies have all been extreme characters who go over the edge. From CGI titans to hormonal, vengeful aspiring kings, the Wave 3 crew has lost much of the balance some of the earlier villains had. Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) is a character that backpedals into a balanced character, an antagonist who won't annoy you to hating them for their grandiose flaws. She's got some backstory, is integrated well to other characters, and remains embedded in the story to develop alongside the rest of the cast.Funny: See my previous reviews, but Ant-Man 2 rocks in regards to being comedically entertaining. The writing is the start of this ride, a blend of comedic styles that will appease just about everyone who loves to laugh whether it be from banter or a well-timed insult. Director Peyton Reed kept things balanced with this work, and therefore didn't overdo the comedy, or should I say overuse a comedic style. Yet the actors who bring the words to life get the final round of applause for making the most out of comedic gold. Rudd's sarcasm, but his relaxed atmosphere works fantastically. Douglas style is all about dry sarcasm and stoic delivery to counter the energy of just about every character in the crew. Yet... it's Michael Peña who really shines in this movie. His energy, his confusion, his surprise and his yelling were all fantastic qualities to make him the king of the comedy in this movie.DISLIKES:More Bite from Bad Guys: Ghost has got skills and a story, but she is lacking that bite that Marvel Villains are known to have. I can't say much without ruining too much, but this more balanced mercenary is in need of a little more hate/angst to drive her actions, in hopes of making for a more suspenseful tale. In regards to Sonny (Walton Goggins) well he was meant to be a little more deceptive and menacing, but his malice was diluted due to the comedic direction of the movie.Too Much Comedy?: Disney's last wave of movies is very heavily focused on making people laugh in some form or manner. While it is always good to laugh, I feel this approach is limiting the potential of the movie to be as balanced and exciting as the first few waves. Ant-Man 2 is fun and entertaining, but the comedy becomes the primary focus and sort of dilutes the other qualities of the film at times. In the case of this movie it is the suspense and action that take most of the hits. Speaking of which...The Action: The First Ant-Man had all the props out to utilize the technology of the hero of varying sizes. As they train to break in, we get exciting military like strategy, before a very fast and engaging fight between two suits. This movie started out with a good fight led by Wasp, which showed off girl power to all proportions. After that... not much else happened even at the end where the exciting climax was a little silly than amazing. Yes, it is entertaining, but it didn't have all the pizazz and edge like the first film, and did fall into repetitive maneuvers that were okay. Again, still fun, but just didn't reach the levels of the first for me.The VERDICT:Overall, the sequel to Ant-Man works on many levels and does its job at the follow-up to the big, bad Infinity War. It's placeholder status has plenty of fun, laughs, and entertainment for the whole family and will certainly keep everyone chuckling by some means. In addition, it has a thousand times better character development than expected, and gives all the players ample involvement in the story, despite all the laughing you will be doing. Still, it's not the most thrilling or exciting of the bunch primarily that the bad guys are not as malicious and the comedy floods much of the movie and washing away the other qualities. However, it is absolutely worth the trip to the theater with your friends and family, to just enjoy the ride. Of note: The Mid-Credits scene will tie the film to Infinity War and the end credit is another laugh.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.5"
962,7,"A fast and funny, but not truly pivotal, superhero flick... Ant-Man and the Wasp is just the recovery we needed after the harrowing events that transpired in Avengers: Infinity War. Like it's predecessor, this sequel is a delightful crowdpleaser, brimming with charm, laughs, and fast-paced, stylish action, though some setbacks occur as a result of these factors (which I'll address soon). Paul Rudd is irresistible. Scott Lang remains the plucky, wise-cracking superhero and loving father figure we grew to know in 2015's Ant-Man, and these elements hold up strong in The Wasp, but he isn't exactly the star of the action this time around. In this spot is Hope van Dyne, sporting the Wasp suit that is armed with wings and blasters. As much as I wish I saw Ant-Man participate more in the excitement, these sequences are refreshingly quick and inventive, given the consistent size-changing that occurs between the close combat and obstacle evasion, and I was quite fond of the car chase set-pieces adopting this element, too. Overall, Wasp delivers the thrills, and Ant-Man serves as the film's heart. Despite not seeing Scott's family that much in this entry, the small scenes where Scott bonds with his daughter Cassie are quite heartwarming. It's not often we see a superhero who is also a dedicated parent and its welcoming to witness such a genuine love between these characters, even if it is minimal.Something problematic about the set-pieces is that there's no coherent flow. At times the sequences did feel cluttered and unfocused, constantly shifting attention to different set-pieces happening simultaneously with contrasting moods when they could've played out individually. Perhaps that's because the film has too many antagonists. We have an estranged former partner of Pym's who wants to help a girl, called Ghost, who is cursed with unhinged object-phasing abilities to return to normal, and more often then not she goes rogue, then we have a black marketeer trying to steal Pym's technology for monetary gain. There's just so much going on between all these baddies that it makes the narrative a tad complicated. Writing out the black marketeer would've helped maintain a reasonable story flow. After all the excitement thats transpires, there's really no consequences from all of it; nothing that really influences another entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or leaves a deep impact like Infinity War did. Well actually, there is a mid-credits scene fueled from previous events in the timeline that's quite distressing, but that's about it for lasting effects.There's not much else to say, Ant-Man and the Wasp is just a fun romp; a fast and funny, but not truly pivotal, superhero flick. It's effectively tailored by Paul Rudd's irresistible charm and tons of stylized action, though its often bestrewed narrative makes it just shy of its predecessor's greatness. Good enough for me to say suit up!"
963,9,"Bad plot The acting is great in this one (although the best actor in the movie, Laurence Fishburne, is given a boring part with few lines) but the plot sucks. This is the first Marvel movie where I kept checking my watch. The movie doesn't connect to the MCU during the actual movie and this is because they introduce a new villain for no reason. Why put in a new random villain in this phase? Even if you will use the character in a larger sense in a new movie, it still made this one boring. Anyway this is probably the worst MCU movie but it's about 50 times better than normal movies that come out every week."
964,9,"Fun Hilarious movie , very fun to watch Almost no boring scenes"
965,7,"Not what I was waiting... but fun anyway... I'm what you can call a Marvel fanboy... I have seeing every Marvel movie on day 1! I even wait for 1 hour in a line to see Infinity War... this movie was suppose to be the setup for Avengers 4... nop... is not... The movie is fun, not as good as the first one, but fun... the name must be The Wasp and And-Man because the wasp was baddass, and man... not so much... And-Man is a little dumb in this one... not the best Marvel movie!!!! but fun to watch... more like a 6.5... but 7 will work..."
966,8,"SHOCK & AWE!!!! SHOCK AND AWE. Only way you can describe a sold out Fan Boy (and girl) filled theatre as Marvel did what they do best.Ant-Man returned for it's sequel to find Scott Lang serving the final 3-days of his two year house arrest sentence after being captured in Germany, helping ""Cap"" (aka Captain America). Meanwhile, somewhere in San Francisco, Hank Pym and his daughter, Hope (The Wasp) are purchasing what can best be described as the Flux Capacitor* from a Black Arms Dealer. Their transaction is put on hold when a mysterious and elusive ghost appears wanting the same Flux Capacitor*.Thus, the complexity of the storyline unveils. Good guys vs. the mysterious Ghost. Good guys vs. Black Arms Dealers. Mysterious Ghost vs. Black Arms Dealers. Then throw in Scott Lang vs. the FBI. And the story wrote itself.**The Flux Capacitor was a cinematic brilliant decision by Steven Spielberg and Robert Zamekis dating back to the original Back to the Future. Its what makes time travel possible. That's all one needs to know. Accept it at face value, the flux capacitor makes time travel possible. Fast forward several decades later and apply that theory here. The box being purchased from the black arms dealer makes entering the realm possible. Thus Hank's quest to save his wife, played by Michelle Pfieffer.Full of laughs throughout the film, especially all scenes involving Michael Pena or the Elementary School, Ant-Man is the 20th film released under the Marvel Cinematic Universe storyline. Each brilliantly linked together.And, as mentioned in the opening paragraph, Marvel leaves you with an end credit scene everyone will be talking about!charliemoviedatabase.weebly.com"
967,7,"Fun sequel which allows charismatic cast to sing Set after Civil War and just before Infinity War, Peyton Reed shows that a light touch and smaller stakes can be just as satisfying as lights in the sky and the imminent destruction of a nameless city.Despite shoehorning in way too many sub-plots and even the overall 'villain' could have just asked for help nicely, it all doesn't matter because it is fun to see this cast muck around and blow things up and shrink them down again.Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are great- effortless charisma machines who have actual chemistry (see Pratt and Howard for the extreme opposite in Jurassic World). On top of that at every turn you have great actors whether it be the old firm with Michael Douglas, Laurence Fishburne and Michelle Pfeiffer as the first generation of SHIELD scientists or Randall Park and Walton Goggins making otherwise bit parts sing. And then there is Michael Pena as Luis. He is so ridiculously charming and funny that the best scene in the entire special effect laden film is just him telling a story with help from the rest of the cast.So despite structural issues and in many ways not even a plot, the characters are so well defined and so fun that the film ends up being a solid entertainment delivery system.Whatever Paul Rudd is being paid - double it."
968,10,Comedy action fun for everyone!!! A sequel as funny as the first!!! Very fun to watch. Worth seeing on the big screen. NO POLITICS!! Just an enjoyable movie to relax and laugh at!!!
969,7,"Go See It This movie is a nice break from the world destruction of most other superhero films. The story is simple and fun, more so than the first, and Marvel again captures the charisma of Paul Rudd and the essence of Ant Man and fits it in amongst a cast worthy of praise."
970,7,"Great bit of light hearted fun In the lead up to the release of Ant Man & The Wasp I was a little unfazed by its impending release with it being so close after the massive explosion that was Avengers: Infinity War in April. The trailers for the sequel seemed ""run of the mill"" and didn't really grab me that much and while I thoroughly enjoyed Ant-Man on release, I hadn't actually viewed it since it's home release all that time ago.I arrived at the cinema last night for my advanced screening tired and not particularly excited after bad traffic on the way which almost made me consider just going home and catching it another night. I am glad I didn't just go home because this was actually a really fun time and surprised the hell out of me. As other viewers have noted, Ant Man & The Wasp provides a nice upbeat fun time which is great after the tone of Infinity War.Ant Man & The Wasp thankfully does not follow the main ""solo"" story structure of most of the earlier Marvel movies by not having a clear cut villain which is great.Very Slight Spoilers AheadThe main plot of the film revolves around the search for Hope's mother played by Michelle Pfeiffer who has been lost in the Quantum realm for 30 odd years.The film looks great for the most part and the returning supporting cast are fantastic as they were in the original with Michael Pena having a particularly great scene that everyone in the theatre was hoping for at about the halfway mark.It is worth noting that as with the original film, we open to a flashback of sorts using de-ageing Visual Effects trickery on both Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer, let me just say that this is the absolute best success of this technology i have ever seen. I was trying so very hard to pick it apart and while Douglas' looked a tiny bit ""uncanny valley"" I could not for the life of me pick out anything wrong about de-aged Pfeiffer, it was that good I could have been watching a newly scanned film print from the 80s.The only thing that lacked for me was the film's soundtrack felt as if it could have been a little punchier, for instance in the final act car chase sequence the soundtrack felt like it was ramping up to something but never did.Acting wise the whole cast did a great job including a smaller side character played by Randall Park who had some fun little scenes which really added to the film.Ant Man & The Wasp succeeds as a lighthearted breath of fresh air with well executed comedy and a hell of a fun time.Thanks to Event Cinemas Marion for providing the advanced screening for this review,"
971,7,"It takes an Ant and a Wasp the cheer you up with an optimistic family story If you want a friendly little movie to cheer you up, here it is. I can't help but to have a good time with an Ant-Man story. The character is sympathetic and pretty much a lighthearted everyday man who stumbles into excitement. It's designed to delight people with an optimistic, family-type vibe. I've seen some complaints saying that there's a lack of greater or darker stakes/consequences. I don't mind it in this particular series. The weight lies in the family dynamics. And also in the message that being a hero isn't always stopping bad guys, but helping your friends and family. Or I guess by simply saying that being there, showing support, is very important. A message that can also be picked up from films like ""The Incredibles"" or Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"". The difference would be that the actual action aspect never involves ""the end of the world"" or any big destruction like that. It's perfect that things lead up to a car chase in the streets with people changing sizes and jumping from vehicle to vehicle. There doesn't need to be a war or countless buildings collapsing. If the human story is there at the heart and the action helps run the story along, then I'm happy. Oh, and I appreciate when the action set-pieces are clever. Which, yeah. You get some of that.I saw plenty of families in the cinema. So it really marked the impression that people with different ages can all be apart of the adventure together and have a good time with the lighthearted honesty of the characters. Scott Lang is so natural at being a kind man who you wouldn't mind playing Guitar Hero with or just running into shenanigans with. His relationship with the daughter was genuinely touching and again, so natural. It's like it was Paul Rudd's real-life daughter. Michael Peña, Evangelina Lilly and Michael Douglas are all equally charismatic with plenty of screen presence. I was only taken out of the movie at one part, which is the part with my biggest negative. The villain's start spouting a lot of exposition and there's this big explanation to the audience. That should have been evened out more because it came across as lazy. The execution of the resolution was also a bit off. It begs the audience to go along with a certain idea and it's too convenient for the moment. And the editors were rushing to get to another scene without letting a previous one end properly. All of a sudden, we're somewhere else and more exposition is given. Come on, let there be some moment to breath in between there. Lastly I wanna say that Walton Goggins shouldn't be given a throw-away role like that. Wasted potential. Although the new character Jimmy Woo was a great stand-out.Other than that really, I had fun experience. I wasn't taking it that seriously either, which is not the point. Love the giant ants helping out and I was in awe of how real the father-daughter relationship was between Scott and Cassie Lang. Not the best Summer Blockbuster, but a lot nicer compared to what we've been getting these past years. ""Transformers"" and ""Jurassic World"", I'm looking at you. Take notes."
972,8,"Beautiful family movie. With PEZ. I always had a very special place in my heart for Ant-Man. There's something great about all that ant-sized stuff and I just can't get enough of it. And the first movie? Loved it. Not only it captured the Ant-Man feeling, it turned out to be a pretty nice family movie. Scott Lang was different from the other MCU characters. Not only he was one of those cute hapless characters that you can't help but love, he was also a father of a cute little daughter. Families, that's what MCU Ant-Man was all about. And that's why I loved it so much. So, when Ant-Man didn't appear in the Infinity War, I was a little bit disappointed. Just a little, though, since Infinity War had more than enough content even without Ant-Man and I can't argue with the writers - connecting Ant-Man at this point was a bit too hard because of the difference in the mood. I mean, Infinity War was a bit too dark (by MARVEL standards), while the original Ant-Man ended with a happy ending. So...Anyway, the fact that Ant-Man wasn't in the latest Avengers only made me more excited about his own new movie. Naturally, I went to premiere. So, how it is? How's the second Ant-Man movie? Well... Like the first one, Ant-Man 2 (AKA Ant-Man and the Wasp) is a perfect family movie. It's bright, it's fun, it's cute and it's all about families. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer make a perfect couple and make the movie likable for the older generation, while Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly do the same for the younger audience. Ant-Man and the Wasp is something you can watch with the entire family and leave the theater with a ton of a good mood.There's one thing about it that feels a bit weird, though. And that thing is - there's no big events here. Like, nothing really big happens. Well, aside from Ant-Man himself, since sure, our unlucky hero will go big like never before. The thing is - even the villain this time is family-friendly. Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost is a bit broken as a person, but still extremely likable and doesn't do anything to make you actually hate her. And since the rest of the villains are just losers... it feels like something's missing here. Imagine Winter Soldier movie with just Bucky. With just Bucky who didn't actually kill anyone. Imagine Thor movie with just Loki. And that will be it. Ant-Man and the Wasp misses some bigger evil, which leads to the lack of our usual epic final battle.Don't get me wrong, though, Ant-Man and the Wasp has A LOT of action. Incredibly awesome action, since every battle here uses the idea about size changes as much as possible. People responsible for battle scenes did absolutely fantastic job. That scene with the PEZ dispenser... loved it. And not only because I'm a PEZ collector myself, but because it felt so... fresh and awesome. A lot of imagination here and sure, special effects are just wow with 3D being great as usual. There's also more than enough eye-popping stuff besides the battles. De-aged Michael Douglas, Microverse... Ant-Man and the Wasp looks amazing and not only because of the great battle scenes. But the thing is - MARVEL kind of established their own formula. And like you know that there'll be two extra scenes after the credits, you can't help but expect a certain amount of battles. The one at the beginning to warm up, some in the middle and one epic battle in the end. Sure, we've got one at the beginning, a few in the middle, but... there's no epic battle in the end. And what makes it even more weird, there's no even James Bond-like something. I mean, no big bomb to destroy the entire city, no earthquake device, no man-made volcano, or giant robot. Nothing like that. There's just... hugs and happy ending. Which is sure nice. Because, like I said, it turns Ant-Man 2 into a perfect family movie. But still, it feels a bit weird for a MARVEL movie. Personally, I always wait for that big epic something at the end. Like that Wakanda event in the Infinity War... Man, I loved it (Wakanda forever!!!). So, I can't help but feel I tiny little bit disappointed here. Just because.So, long story short, don't expect anything groundbreaking from Ant-Man and the Wasp. Sure, it's an amazing family movie. It gives you a lot of warm feelings, it looks awesome, it has a lot of really smart action which you won't see anywhere else... but it doesn't have one of those groundbreaking stories with twists, important connections to the Avengers and epic final battle. It's just that - a very expensive and incredibly looking family movie. Which is a good thing in its own way. I actually miss the times when we had more of such stories on the big screen. I like movies that make you remember about how important families are and I like movies that make you feel good about it. So, personally, I loved Ant-Man and the Wasp. And still, you can't help but feel that it's a bit too simple and a bit too straightforward."
973,8,"Entertaining and Important Very entertaining sequel, storyline is hugely important to the MCU Universe"
974,9,"Great movie After disappointing Deadpool 2 I was glad I was happy to watch another great movie. Unlike the first movie, jokes in a sequel actually lend and storyline is much more interesting."
975,7,"The usual marvel fun-ness I went into this with expectations similar to the first AntMan movie and it was exactly what I expected - which is to say it was a fun and lighthearted movie that doesn't take itself seriously and definitely has much more of a comedic tone than other Marvel movies. To me this is a great thing - one of the things Marvel does well is mix up the tone of the various movies so it doesn't always feel as if every movie feels the same.The only downside, to me, for this movie was the main plot of the movie didn't really draw me in. The jokes you could also see coming from a mile away, but they were still enjoyable overall. A few times I felt the joking banter between characters went on a little bit too long. But I'm just nitpicking now.Overall the movie is certainly worth spending the money in the theater to see.Definitely stay for the post-credit scene."
976,2,"More of the same Even though I enjoyed the first one as a comedy movie itself (and not a hero movie, more like an ""introduction"" movie into becoming some sort of hero), it was ""ok"" for me the fact that they inserted a very generic, uninteresting, forgettable villain in it (by now we always expect this kind of villain in MCU introduction movies).Well, this time they expanded the team into Ant-man + Wasp, which was nice. But that was the only main change (besides the after-credit scene).They still managed to create the same structure of the previous movie, instead of a ""hero movie""...again a comedy movie... instead of a well developed villain, again the same uninteresting and forgettable villain.Personally I think I lost money watching it since it was again more of the same, maybe I have should waited until it was on Netflix or something."
977,8,"Great Sequel! Manages to retain the feel and charm of the original and further expands on it in many ways. Like in any great sequel everything is a bit bigger(some times literally). It's funnier, more action-packed, and the stakes are higher! Also the characters have the same great chemistry as before which results in some very funny and moving moments. Also it has Michelle Pfeiffer, I mean she makes everything better :) Like the original it perhaps is not among the greatest of Marvel movies, but it has it's own unique charm!"
978,10,Super movie Super movie all is there. Movie is entertainment and full of Funny surprises
979,10,"Perfect Marvel Movie Ant-Man and The Wasp has it all: humor, laughs, action, everything you want out of a Marvel movie. This movie is just perfect in every way. The villain Ghosts has the exact powers as it shows in the comics. Ghost is a perfect villain. A littlebit like Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War. Ant-Man and The Wasp will excite you, entertain you, and will make you wanna see the movie again, again, and again."
980,10,"Funny than everything Dear movie freaks, you will love this movie. Dear Marvel fans, you will be just dying to watch it, because this is the really funny movie, funny than everything!! The story starts up from the Ant Man, that is now being under police watch as home-prisoner, but it looks like everybody loves him and find him to resolve many problems, a former girlfriend, a boss, and the police themselves. The main story of this movie is really really entertaining, without any serious meanings, even though the quantum physic concept is quiet hard to be understood. But here the Director and cinematographer delivers the concept with the very iconic moment to be Antman, sometimes being small and disappear, but sometimes getting bigger like Godzilla. Here the movie maker has such deep understanding about how to make the story of Marvel heroes, that are related to other universe. Also just prepare for post-credit, don't you miss it out!! OMG"
981,1,"failed attempt and wasted potential Tried like other mcu movies, but to say it worse. it seemed forced. ""villain"" (youll know why i quoted this once u watch it) wasnt worth it, more like lex luthor from batman v superman. it was slow at beginning, i only wished i could fast forward like on tv, later on it tries getting fun but weve seen that style a lot. i buy mcu movies for bluray but not this (and few others) overall it went out like justice league (couldnt find another movie to compare)"
982,1,"Boring, I don't know why they making this.. all MCU movies are same plot"
983,8,A sequel to the equal Loved it. At least the equal of the first Ant Man if not better.
984,10,"Awesome Marvel Sporty... Size matters. Or is it not? Or yes, but in another direction and another meaning? In any case, the films about ""Human-Ant"" return us to the first films of the universe of Marvel, when to watch the screened comics was funny and at ease. The film turned out to be very light, cheerful in practice, with a bunch of funny moments and without pinching into sentimentality, with cool action scenes and great graphics (without the candy photoshop of the second ""Guardians of the Galaxy""). Plot ... And can anyone remember the plot of at least one kinomikomksa?Obadishka Paul Rudd does not cease to please. His Scott Lang still shines with the ability to get into stupid situations, stand up for the interests of the weak, at the same time build eyes Hope van Dine (Evangeline Lilly) and cardboard labyrinths for her daughter, leaving with honor from all these provisions. The hero obviously got development, and it's nice - there's no feeling that we continue where the previous film finished.However, if it was a theatrical production, Rudd's role would be called ""second lead"" - the second main character, a partner. Despite the title of the film, the central role in the film is allotted to Ose. Hope van Dine moved away from ""I'm all this business with a cool hairstyle,"" yet she demanded a suit from the pope and actively entered the path of struggle with all who stand in the way of saving the mother from the quantum space. It's very cool to see a strong female character who actually works in the film, rather than decorating the main character.The whole movie wants to smile. For the main humor, as in the previous film about the life of insects, answers Michael Peña. Louis still does not shut up for a second and does not say a word about the case, and it's still very funny. It would seem that comedy memes and chips are boring, but no, here it works. But the rest make a decent contribution to a living atmosphere. Hank Pim performed by Michael Douglas constantly trolls Scott. The young actress who plays Cassie Lang, simply fascinates with her spontaneity and her naturalness. Ironically, one of the most moving scenes in the film is one of the funniest, thanks to the magnificent facial expressions and expression of Paul Rudd's eyes.The film leaves behind a long forgotten children's delight of adventure. Energetic, lively, kind, colorful - epithets very much. At some point, the universe of Marvel took an unnecessarily gloomy tone, in my opinion, and ""The Man-Ant and the Wasp"" are a good antidote to the slightly depressing latest films. If we evaluate the environments of other films of this genre, for all of the above the film clearly deserves10 of 10"
985,10,Funnier Than Ragnarok - Worth Watching This film deserves to be hyped a lot more than it is currently. It's so funny and I really hope it gets the box office opening it deserves.
986,9,"Mr Crapbag being himself Paul Rudd is the right guy to be a humorous and genius superhero dad. He successfully showed us his comedian side (even after more than 20 years becoming Mr Crapbag on FRIENDS), his generosity, clueless, but helpful to others. Marvel deserves a lifetime award and I'm willing to see more of your masterpieces."
987,9,"Decent Great movie to watch that has a perfect blend of Action, emotion and comedy it's definitely better than the first one."
988,8,"A Much More Family Friendly & Super Light Marvel Superhero Movie Well this movie was real fun to see. In this sequel, Paul Rudd & Michael Pena reprised their roles and I got to say that most of the fun I had were involving them. Rudd's Scott was charming, made a lot of jokes and his sometimes high school love struck scenes with Hope were amusing to see. Plus his relationship with cute daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) was adorable.Apart from those amusing scenes, the movie plot was actually rather simple. It was a rescue mission while avoiding the chase by 2 groups of people. The Ghost character, however, was what I personally felt as the rather weak point of this film. It was not a great villain that I had hoped for to be the enemy of Ant-man. And despite having another villain, I also thought that he was not a scary one. But I guess Marvel just want to make sure that this movie was kept as light as possible, which was why even the villains were not the scariest and in fact rather grey.Special effects of the movie were as good as you can get. The enhancing or miniaturizing of objects were done nicely. It was also the part where the movie became very funny as we would be amused by the very giant Ant-man (or the half sized Scott). The supporting cast here were also fun to see, especially Randall Park as agent Woo, and Luis' team Dave & Kurt (played by Tip T.I. Harris and David Dastmalchian respectively). Even though their screen time were not so much, they were still able to provide some laughter for us audience.For an almost 2 hours movie, the movie did not feel boring or rushed at all. The pace was quite steady, the funny moments were quite abundant. And the jokes definitely still manageable for younger children. So the movie is definitely safe to be seen by kids and the whole family. In case you are wondering, there was 1 mid end credit scene and 1 post end credit scene.Overall this movie was a really family friendly one. It was super light, not having a difficult plot to understand (apart from maybe the quantum realm matter that was a little bit complicated) and definitely to be enjoyed as a fun Marvel superhero movie. So please do not expect an awesome great fight between Ant-man & the Wasp with the enemies as the fights were also made rather light. It was definitely not the one that would amaze you by the full action but you would be leaving the theater feeling happy and intrigued as the same time especially after seeing those end credit scene. If you are looking for a light entertaining superhero movie, then this one definitely suit your need.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
989,6,"Another entertaining, funny, yet mediocre Marvel solo (or duo?) movie Nothing's really changing about the mediocre part about MCU solo run (Thor Ragnarok for the exception), especially this one. well yeah, Scott and Luis are still funny and entertaining to the viewers, Hope and her father are still serious about business (but Hope is really kicking many asses in this movie!), the new main villain is not actually a villain, but rather, a victim to Pym's great ego that great minds tend to have, but the pace is kinda quiet confusing, like we go from place to place, from one character to another without a clear link to connect them. but hey, it's still funny as hell when Luis starts to narrate and quote a section of his life from one story to another, from one people to another, from start to finish like he used to do in the first Ant-Man movie. Spoiler Alert! this might be a solo or even a duo superhero movie, but by the end of it, people will realize that this is only a small part of a bigger cinematic universe."
990,7,"Loved it! This was a breath of fresh air from the space fights and aliens and mega-powered gauntlets in Infinity War, and I think we really needed it. It kept the same type of humour from the first movie, and at the same time, added in more weight the first movie didn't have. I genuinely feared for the characters but I could also sympathise with Ghost, who has an incorrect portrayal in the trailers, just wants to stay alive (it's not some world-wide issue with millions of lives at stake, I like that). Overall, I really enjoyed the ride and shame on me for thinking it was an average movie -- you should all watch it."
991,2,"Ants in your pants waiting for this movie to be over So it can be done. Marvel CAN make a movie worse than Iron Man 2/Guardians 2.Paul Rudd has always tried too hard and as both actor and co-writer here, his Ant Man & Wasp feels unnecessarily complicated with little in terms of drama and/or satisfying payoff.What's with the messy story line which turns out to be much ado about nothing (Quantum is the new Vibranium, Tesseract but lacks the intrigue), wasting the talents of Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, having Randall Park play Detective Louis from Fresh off the Boat, the heavy handed parent-child messages, the one too many long, lingering looks (Scott and Hope, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer), side jokes shoe honed into many scenes that get worn very fast and go nowhere and of course, the baddies...baddies who are such a joke that any conflict with them only serves to remind us that Ant Man is really a peewee in the Marvel Universe in every sense of the word.Wasp is a rare bright spark with Evangeline Lilly looking like she can wrestle Scarlett Johansson for the title of Marvel's hottest/kickass female superhero. You go girl!The theatre we were in was muted throughout the show and the first audible laugh was the baddies fessing up post truth serum, which was almost towards the end. Says a lot.Of course, you cannot not watch Ant Man & Wasp coz it is part of the MCU but if you're truly objective, you would know the MCU has a new contender for worst/most redundant/blah movie in its ranks."
992,8,"What you needed after ending of Infinity War It brilliantly executes the one thing everyone needed after what happened in Infinity War: lots of action and fun! Hope had the most wonderful action scenes in the movie. Cassie stands out with her cuteness and connection with Scott. Paul Rudd delivered excellently from drama, to comedy. The supporting cast is so strong for this movie. Finally Ghost is one of the best ANTagonist in the MCU. There's emotion and you will have a dilemma about this character. Overall, a great movie."
993,7,"Another fun & slightly off-kilter 'superhero' film 'Ant-Man & The Wasp' is the third Marvel film in the last five months - but importantly, it's the first since 'Avengers: Infinity War' and the last for eight months. Definitely recommend seeing Infinity War before this. This sequel sticks to the winning formula of the first - Scott/Ant-Man (Rudd)'s charm/humour, Hope/Wasp (Lilly)'s resolve/smarts and Hank (Douglas)'s mentorship/atonement. Less of a heist focus this time, though - more of a rescue mission.Excellent support cast again, most notably Luis (Pena), who has plenty of great lines and laughs. His two offsiders, Dave (TI) and Kurt (Dastmalchian) also get some screen time, as does Cassie (Forston) - Scott's daughter. There's also FBI agent Jimmy (Park), Bill (Fishburne), Janet (Pfeiffer) and Burch (Goggins), all having something to add. The film starts a little slow, trying to establish where we are (after 'Captain America: Civil War', just before 'Avengers: Infinity War').The film picks up with the introduction of Ghost (John-Kamen), who's an interesting antagonist, with her phasing powers. Plenty of good action scenes, balanced (mostly) with humour. Once again, the most stunning scenes are the sub-atomic/quantum realm shrinkages, with exceptional and trippy visuals. As always, stay for the end credits. Not better than the first film, but no worse either."
994,7,"Ant-Man and The Wasp is big on laughs and action yet self-aware of its limits as a sequel. It's been just over two months since Avengers: Infinity War left viewers paralysed with that unexpected and somber ending. Yet film forums and chatrooms are still endemic with what happened, why it happened and how it can be undone in Avengers 4 (currently untitled). Which is why Ant-man and The Wasp couldn't have come out at a better time. There's none of that do or die scenario which immediately elevates this film above something as colossal and imposing as saving the universe, essentially making this sequel a story with a little charm and a lot of humour and with just the right amount of action. Two years after backing Cap in Civil War, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is under house arrest and nearing the end of his sentence. Although this could explain why the Ant-Man wasn't seen in Infinity War, the story suggests that the film isn't too concerned of its position in the MCU. Instead, the story builds on the hypothesis that if Lang could return to his fully functional form after his subatomic adventure in the previous film, then there's a slim possibility of finding Hank Pym's (Michael Douglas) long lost superhero wife and the first Wasp (Michelle Pfeiffer). Together with Hank's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lily as the new Wasp) this is their mission until a new and dangerous character surfaces with an opposing agenda.In the ensuing conflict, Ant-Man and The Wasp erupts into a ton of fun with the inclusion of a motley mix of wacky characters led by Walter Goggins as petty criminal Sunny Birch, Randal Park as a zany FBI agent, Lang's friend and ex-con Michael Peña's Luis (who they pronounce as Louise), and Lawrence Fishburn as Hank's old associate. In the wake of the mass-destruction seriousness of previous MCU films, these characters ground the story with an everyman feel to a level where this superhero story is reduced to a more relatable human scale. But while the film is content with exploring the frailty of family dynamics and kinship, the story feels underdeveloped when it comes to a few essential plot points; the big one being - Ghost - a new and never-before-seen character in MCU films. With the ability to manifest between apparition and physical form, a condition Hank calls ""Molecular Dequilibrium"", Ghost is a welcome addition to the franchise with vast potential as an anti-hero. Perhaps we will know more about this character if there is a third film but until then it suffices to say that this character deserved to be better explored.With the use of scientific jargon in the film, returning director Peyton Reed and his team of five screenwriters (including Rudd himself) also had to throw in some exposition to keep us following. The first half has a lot of this and most viewers will see through the superficiality of it all being just a build-up for what comes later. As a sequel this is expected, along with product placements where we see the product logo cropped to fit the screen. The film really opens up when it stops holding back and then unleashes everything we have been waiting for and more. The action is thick and fast, outdone only by the comic timing from Rudd and Peña. By this time Ant-Man and The Wasp has also devolved the notion that a superhero film doesn't have to be boosted with hype or shrouded in secrecy. In its own 'little' way, this is a superhero film like the good old days and that's all it tries to be - a small and lighthearted story that doesn't require viewers to pull out pivot tables after the film."
995,7,"Good Superhero movie with a bit differentiation I like the fact that this ant man movie takes a bit different path than any superhero movies nowadays. The focus is not just to find and beat the villain, moreover, it has three aims which I respected, rescue one of the main character, beat and ""rescue"" the victim who was gone from good to bad because of the circumstances, and the last, of course (it's not an action movie without it), beat the villain, although this time, it's an easy one and far below the par. And each has pretty much balance scenes.But the fact of its differentiation really makes this movie interesting, different formula and change your expectation a little bit in the middle of the movie, although the end is still predictable :), but the effort is still worth the respects.Another thing, The quantum realm will be something that differentiate ant man movies from another MCU movies and it will be interesting to see in the future, because it is still rare for a movie that opens this curtains. Pretty much a hypothetical, but that's what the movie is all about, isn't it? To raise the imagination and possibly a truth?Character-wise, no one dissapoints, Paul Rudd is the rightest Scott Lang out there and the chemistry with Hope Van Dyke juat keeps growing. Douglas and Pfeiffer do good, and so Pena.Overall, good movie and worth your time and money."
996,8,"Antman and the Wasp teaming up... for a great movie A very good addition to the MCU. Antman is a new type of hero who isn't exceptionally brave or smart, but makes up for it with loyalty and endearing love for his daughter. The storyline is not my favourite, as saving Hank's wife isn't something get behind as vehemently, when compared to the grandiose of Infinity War or the redemption of Peter Parker in Homecoming. However, action sequences are very well done and the movie excellently embraces its gimmick of shrinking and enlarging for a humorous and entertaining effect. Evangeline Lily quickly establishes herself as a badass and capable heroine, and continues to do so throughout the movie (her new hairstyle and suit is also a major improvement to her look, as I was always distracted by her hair in Antman.) Paul Rudd provides many funny and lighthearted moments, but I was relieved that he proved himself useful and heroic in the second half of the film. Many other supporting characters provide humorous moments, mostly in a successful way. Luis is a joy to watch, providing a character I've never seen anything like before, due to his fast talking and child-like demeanour. Overall a solid movie that sets up many interesting characters for future titles. I'm sure we will see more of Ghost, Hank, Wasp the elder, and Bill Foster, and obviously Antman and the Wasp themselves. The mid credit scene is very unexcpected but definitely creates its intended effect. The final credit scene is a great jab at marvel fans, but I hope its a once off."
997,3,"Funnier than the first movie, but lacking overall This movie seems stale, although you can feel some heart behind it. The villain problem is brought back, after two competent, well rounded ones in Black Panther and Avengers Infinity War. I never felt the urge to root for the heroes or cheer for their accomplishments, as opposed to a Captain America movie or even a Thor one. Overall it's an average addition to the MCU and won't be in my top 10 picks to rewatch from this franchise."
998,7,"Come on, Get Happy Greetings again from the darkness. The mystery of why Ant-Man was not involved with the battle for the galaxy in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR has been solved as director Peyton Reed returns to helm the sequel to his 2015 hit ANT-MAN. The reason is very simple: Scott Lang/Ant-Man was under house arrest for his role in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. Yep, an ankle monitor sidelined this superhero for the biggest, baddest clash with Thanos. Somehow, this seems fitting for the most ""normal"" and grounded of all the Marvel characters, as Scott (Paul Rudd) is just a guy trying to overcome his petty thief tendencies while becoming a better father.The story picks up two years after ""Civil War"" and Scott has only 3 days of house arrest remaining. An unusual ""dream"" is the cause of his reluctant reunion with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Hank's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly). A remarkable laboratory (quite the sight-gag), that could also be carry-on luggage, is the source of Hank and Hope's mission to bring back mother Janet (the original Wasp, Michelle Pfeiffer) from the Quantum Realm.It's at this point, if you are a Marvel Universe fan, that you might ask yourself ... so the story is about trying to save one person who has been gone for 30 years? Yes, that's a bit less pressure than being charged with saving the galaxy, which is common occurrence in other Marvel films. Look, this isn't rocket science. Umm, well, it's quantum physics, which is way more complicated ... but the point is, Ant-Man is the Marvel fluff piece. Its purpose is to be light-hearted and entertaining, rather than burdensome and ominous.There may not be an overabundance of depth to the story, but it is overflowing with entertainment value. There are four new writers (along with Mr. Rudd) for this sequel, and they offer up a nice blend of personal redemption, crazy action sequences, and heart-felt emotion. The villains aren't even all that bad. Walton Goggins (""Justified"") is Sonny, a greedy dude who just wants the other-worldly Pym technology, and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) is after that same technology, but only for self-preservation. Her own molecules are separating, causing a fast track to death - despite the help of Hank's old partner, played by Laurence Fishburne.The age-reversing effects we saw on Michael Douglas in the first ANT-MAN are also used this time on Mr. Fishburne and Ms. Pfeiffer. It's quite something to behold. Michael Pena returns as Scott's motor-mouthed partner, and he displays some pure comic genius in the truth serum scene. Randall Park plays the hapless FBI agent in charge of keeping track of Scott, but it's Abby Ryder Fortson as Scott's daughter Cassie who steals every one of her scenes ... and possibly sets the stage for the Ant-Man franchise to carry on to the next generation.Only a certain level of seriousness can be attained for a movie that blasts ""The Partridge Family"" theme song ""Come On, Get Happy"". Or that awards Paul Rudd with a certain trophy designation. Or that has a character scream ""You got Pezzed!"". However, a level of respect is earned with some terrific action - giant and tiny - as well as an exceedingly creative chase scene through the streets of San Francisco. There is a post-credit stinger that ties the film into AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. It's brilliant, but also caused quite the outburst from my fellow viewers. If you enjoy playful and amusing (and you should), then the team of Ant-Man and The Wasp (comedian and straight man/person) will put a smile on your face - just watch out for the seagulls!"
999,10,"Perfect movie with every MCU Element and also perfect villains I gotta say this movie is a huge success. The plot and everything surrounding this movie is perfect. Very perfect. Ghost as a female villain is perfect. The director got the villain perfectly right. And the other villain is perfect as well. Everything about this movie is perfect with no issues at all whatsoever. When it comes out please see it. It's better than the first Ant-Man movie by far. Ant-Man and The Wasp is full of humor, full of laughs, and full of action. And the jokes and humor is very funny."
1000,10,MARVEL doing things right. One of the best Sequels to a movie. Wasp kicks some ass in this movie. Supporting cast carries the movie. Ghost is one of my favorite villains in the MCU.
1001,1,"Generic and Stale I will be short and to the point. If you like your usual happy and funny superhero movies(with a LOT of gags and forced jokes), go for it. If you are looking for something that actually belongs to the superhero genre and has a decent plot, don't watch this movie. It feels like a comedy movie rather than a superhero or CBM."
1002,1,"Haha Every so often, Peyton Reed's Ant-Man and the Wasp manages to channel the same kind of lo-fi irreverence that made the original Ant-Man so memorable. To the new film's credit, those moments come regularly, welcome blasts of fresh air; to its detriment, they serve to remind us of a better movie that we could be watching - one actually built on that kind of cheeky spirit rather than merely utilizing it to distract us from a cumbersome, uninteresting plot.Reed's 2015 film, one of the unlikelier entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, dispensed with the typical heroics and focused on the humor inherent in its concept: A mopey, down-and-out thief winds up with the power to shrink to microscopic levels, whereupon he can ride insects and mind-meld with ants and even kick some occasional human ass. Reed also foregrounded the small-scale emotions of the movie's storyline. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) was simply trying to get back into the good graces of his estranged family, especially his young daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson); the added complication of him now becoming a not-very-good superhero was a force that threatened, sometimes hilariously, to disrupt everybody's lives even further."
1003,7,"Fun Movie. Typical ant man style. A nice low stakes, comedic family film,"
1004,7,"Don't Judge By The Size, Judge By The Quality! Yes, the movie responds to some questions, we asked during ""Infinity War"" and yes, for people who do not watch all the movies, only some selective...all of the movies in the MCU are connected and this one is no exception.I will not get into the details for the movie, but it got everything you need to remember it. The story is fun, the action is great, also connections to other movies. All these, are just some of the incredible things in this movie!Personally for me, Evangeline Lilly in the role of Hope Van Dyne (Wasp) stole the show, because she's incredible, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man evolves himself as a hero, but do not think that the curious moments are less! Actors in supporting roles only make the movie even better. Stellar ensemble, also the humor is spot on. Get ready for a lot of surprises!If you think that watching ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" after ""Infinity War"" is crazy, believe me, Marvel own us once again. Just the thought, that after such a big event in the MCU, we are watching a lighter film, but at the same time extremely important for the culmination of all the events of ten years of stories is mind-boggling!In conclusion ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is another solid entry in the MCU! The film is full of action, fun moments and character development. I will not disclose anything else, but stay to the very end of the movie...One of the credit scenes is easily top notch!"
1005,8,"Slow To Start But Still A Fun Adventure SPOILER: Following the unexpected and shocking moments from ""Avengers: Infinity War"", fans eagerly awaited the next Marvel Studios film for any type of clues as to what will happen next when the next Avengers film arrives next summer. ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", is set before the events of ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and finds Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) under home confinement thanks to a plea deal he took for siding with Captain America in ""Captain America: Civil War"".The years of being at home have driven Scott to find creative ways to entertain himself when his friend Luis (Michael Pena) and his daughter Cassie are not around. Scott is nearing the end of his isolation but knows F.B.I. Agent Woo (Randall Park), is waiting for him to slip up and with a possible twenty year prison term in the balance, he is not eager to make any mistakes. Scott is also on the outs with Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and her father Hank (Michael Douglas) as it is revealed he took the Ant-Man suit and took part in the Civil War without their permission.Fate intervenes when a strange dream causes Scott to contact Hope who in turn takes a reluctant Scott along with her to get to the bottom of the dream. Scott is naturally reluctant as he is days away from freedom and being discovered out and about and consorting with his wanted former associates would not be good for his eventual freedom.A shady tech dealer named Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins) and a dangerous new adversary named ""Ghost"" (Hannah John-Kamen) also complicate matters and force Scott, Hope, and Hank to contend with issues all around them as the race against time on an urgent mission while trying to stay away from Woo and his team.The film is a bit slow getting started but it does have some great character moments as well as humor around the build-up to the action sequences. The action when it comes mixes some great visual FX with some humor as Hope and Scott jump between everyday items at various sizes to face the threats presented to them. The cast works very well with one another and there are some great moments that will likely become favorites for fans of the characters and Marvel.The Ghost is a rather interesting choice as an adversary as we do not have an individual bent on conquest, revenge, mass destruction, or accumulating power and wealth. While it may seem odd to have a more down to earth and relatable villain in a Marvel film, it does continue a recent trend of showing of adversaries who are complex, harder to define, and sympathetic much like The Winter Soldier.There are two scenes in the credits which are very important to the continuity of the Marvel Universe and with ""Captain Marvel"" due in March 2019, it will likely get fans whipped into overdrive thinking about the possibilities they present.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is not as epic in scale as some of the past Marvel films, but thanks to a likeable cast and some timely humor, it should keep fans happy until the next chapter in the series.4 stars out of 5"
