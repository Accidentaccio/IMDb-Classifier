0,4,"All a bit of a stretch at a boring pace This film is way too long for how lukewarm the tone and pace are. Add that with a ton of inconsistencies about their abilities to get involved and not get involved in certain events, plus a mention of Superman in a Marvel film, and it equals a thumbs down from me.This is the first Marvel instalment that I haven't liked. I've been riding the ride since Iron Man and have always been impressed. Varying degrees of impressed, but nonetheless. The best thing about this film for me was the cast itself. They are the reason for all 4 stars I can muster up for this one.Eternals was a really big let down for me. Shang Chi was a much, much better introduction to new characters and new storylines."
1,4,"Eternal As a marvel fan, I am kinda disappointed seeing the film for various of reasons. Especially the unnecessary nudity scenes at the first place, so ya not really a family friendly movie. Not really my cup of tea.Quote: When you love something, you protect it. It is the most natural thing to do in the world."
2,7,Wasted potential Okay after the reviews and other I head before going into this one I had no high hopes. But sure they could've done better with the fight scenes and some scenes felt forced and weird and also felt like they used those names for those actors and you know what show.But overall yes a great action movie but I felt more like okay and now ? Than omg it was such a awesome movie. It was good but just felt like they didn't even try to make it awesome !
3,3,"Another Hollywood debacle Lately it seems that movies are not no more than a reflection of Hollywood's' own troubles. Hero's with clinical depression questioning their own existence and all but devoid of happiness.Angelina's character was there for what reason? To show us all that even superhero's need therapy?This one belongs on the scrap heap along with the last pathetic James Bond mess.It barely qualifies for a 3. A waste of time, unless you find flawed characters, poor acting, and melancholy entertaining."
4,2,"Should have been a Disney show. This doesn't even feel like a recent MARVEL movie - comes across as slapdash and hastily put together, and the plot doesn't make sense. This business with THENA getting out of control over and over, they should have dealt with that, she's a danger to the whole team. A spicier take would have been: What's so special about humanity that we should save them? They're ruining the planet and the people they tend to put in charge are just the worst. We're letting the Celestial out, and then the Avengers have to stop the Eternals. By the way, i downloaded this illegally, and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater."
5,2,"Is this REALLY the best they could do? I agree with everyone else that the story and the pacing is just awful. About halfway through I realize what Serci realizes: whatever side you're on, Mankind is really just food. One side has been sucking down folks for dinner (LOVED that little kid watch his Dad get swallowed up right from the start, reminded me of a dinosaur documentary I saw showing a T-Rex that got too close to shore only to find out he really wasn't the apex predator - Eternals reference there too - if you include the world's ancient oceans). The other side has been raising them like cattle to be ingested by a new Eternal living in the Earth's core; when there's enough dummies on Earth generating enough life force they get chowed down during the ""Emergence"".Once you realize this - and our memory-erased heros have been helping do this to countless civilizations across the galaxy for millennia - you realize that the boredom you've endured to that point just isn't worth it. I turned it off and went looking for the first Iron Man yet again. Watching the beautiful Gemma Chan is a delight but there's nothing else here that's worth your time. Couldn't even finish this."
6,1,"The Most Pretentious Marvel Film I Ever Seen This film tried many things and it failed tremendously, one of the worst films in general that I ever seen! The first sign that this film is terrible was the opening, a wall of text you have to read, are you kidding me!? This isn't Star Wars so why are you using that trope?! They could of creatively used the Cgi to make a cool background explanation like they did with Black Panther, that was way better, or maybe used Sprite because wasn't that the point of their powers, to be a storyteller? Terrible beginning!The acting is terrible as well, it clear that these actors and actresses doesn't give a damn about the story, especially the main leads of Sersei and Ajak, the worst! The only characters that I cared about was Phastos, Druig, and the fast girl because they gets things done, they don't mope around like a bunch of morons like Ikaris and Spite. Ikaris was a complete moron in this movie, the whole argument of life was taken at face value and made me hate this movie for even trying to talk about something as philosophically deep as that!Can't believe that this film was even made, it's pointless and keeps trying to reference other Marvel stuff like who cares! Also that ""sex scene"" that Kevin Fiege was bragging that this was some ""ground breaking"" moment in cinema is just embarrassing, the two main leads had no chemistry! The chemistry between Edward and Bella from Twilight is more better than this garbage!"
7,6,"Eternally Mid If you want to make a movie that tackles complex themes like existentialism, faith, and duty, you need to have emotional impact and Eternals is sorely lacking in that department. It's a movie that suffers from serious pacing problems that are further compounded by boring characters.The decision to shoot using primarily natural light is a creative gamble that ultimately hurts the film because better lighting is needed to elevate many scenes and to provide that contrast between exterior and interior shots. The film is drab, even though some of the visuals are truly breathtaking.Also, the flipping between different eras and characters is not well done by the writers at all and many characters or ""emotional moments"" pay the price for it. It's hard to care about the story because something feels like it's missing, and everything feels too subtle and nuanced to make an impact."
8,7,"Cerebral, Soulful, Diverse, Dope Visuals + Perf Cast I hated the story the first time I watched it. There is A LOT going on. It was difficult to follow. But the visuals? WHEW! Absolutely stunning cinematography and visual effects. Marvel has dumbed us down and conditioned us to expect a certain look + story.I am an intellectual person and always in my mind so I decided to give it another chance. I tried to go into it without any typical Pre Marvel expectations. Wow! Once I paid attention to the story and watched it a second time my mind was blown. It's a beautiful story with so many themes + metaphors. I myself was most touched by Gilgamesh's protective loving care of Thena. As well as Sersi in general as a mortal hearted + earth loving immortal.What she did for Sprite!? I needed them to do a little better for Ikaris's ending. It seemed. . too tidy + not in line with his character development.Even if it was to just see Chloe Zao's gorgeous naturalist style of shooting I would watch it a 4th time now. I mean the visuals alone made me SWOON. The cast, the costume design!If you only watched it once, give it another go with a more open mind. Try to go into it without expecting anything like Endgame. Also check out the BTS doc on Disney+ called, 'Assembled: The Making of The Eternals,' if you haven't already. I promise it will be worth it.CANNOT WAIT FOR MAHERSHALA IN BLADE!!!"
9,6,"Why? I will start by saying that I am 100% behind Hollywood including more racial diversity. I am all for more strong female lead movies. I am in no way that hater of those things, that sadly I read so many comments about on here. That said, in the context of this story, I am not sure why they chose to go that route, especially when their origin is explained. Why would Asherem design such a racily diverse group, especially when he sends them to earth at a time when everyone would be mocha colored. Also, why make one deaf? Why make one a child? Why make one gay? Again, I am in no way against that if it fits the story. Here, it just feels forced and honestly, underutilized, as it doesn't really play a part in the plot. It's nice to see the diversity, but doing it just because it gives more fodder for the haters to latch onto.The movie itself suffered slightly because of thi,, but overall I found it enjoyable."
10,3,ugg So glad I didnt pay to go see this it actually took me 3 times to get through the movie. It was long tedious and BOOOORING I kept hoping the movie was getting toword end so something would happen but then I would pause it and it would say 1:23 min to go whoever directed this and wrote this should never get a job again in hollywood.
11,10,Decent attempt on vfx. Worth 10 Very good actions worth goosebumps. Man of steel level vfx. Average kids will give average rating. But i find it very good compare to Spiderman NWH. But giving it such low ratings. I dont understand these marvel fan-kids-base.
12,7,"Surprised me Avoided it due to the hate and was quite surprised.It isn't a typical superhero film at all and very non marvel so don't expect it and it helps. This is more of a drama with superpowers, think of a cw show done well with less romance and better acting and the acting is what won me over. The characters are fun and enjoyable to watch.Again less superhero fighting and more drama entertainment.Know that and you will find it is way easier to digest."
13,1,"They start to run out of elegance Profanity and pervert are in this movie, they need to look different than DC but they are starting to do things not for the family and they need to change this, the actors are great except two of them and the family they show is not good for the viewers,stand for what's right, the effects are good but only one scene was really bad and I mean very bad, not for kids that's for sure.And the reference they make to DC are horrible, please be original. Keep marvel strong in the right path."
14,3,POOR/DISGUSTED That sex scene between Sersi and Ikaris was completely unecessary and uncalled for. Disgusted to say the least - bunch of idiots. There are young kids watching this pathetic movie!
15,1,Horrible movie This has got to be one of the worst marvel movies out there. These so called Godly beings who have lived for thousands of years if not millions are tremendously weak. I was expecting them to be insanely strong based on their origins and their kind but it seems like Thor would have the strength to wipe them from existence.The movie lacked a flow to it. It seemed dragged on even though the movie wasn't too long. Not worth watching.
16,5,"Almost didn't finish As time has gone on, I've been enjoying movies less and less. It seems that many movie makers are more interested in making sure they are 'inclusive' of everyone instead of just focusing on a good story. I want to see the stories of people and heroes. Too many stories are ruined by the agenda of focusing on race or lifestyles. I don't need every group to be the U. N. I want to see heroes just being heroes. If they are a white hero, black hero, gay hero, woman hero...I don't need the preaching to make sure that I am 'inclusive' and sensitive."
17,6,"Diversity lecture rather than a super hero scifi The story goes like this an Asian guy, a white female, a white guy, a Philippine female, a gay black guy, a non speaking mexican girl, an Indian guy, a Latina female, a confused teenager white girl. Cross breeding relationship between a white guy and a Philippine lady, Chinese and white lady etc with a story to save planet. It sucked big time didn't get the feel of watching a move rather a lecture about diversity."
18,3,"Just Because You're Boring, Doesn't Mean You're Smart The Eternals are a band of thoroughly unlikable characters. With so many characters in the main cast it can be difficult to keep track of which one is which. But eventually I'm satisfied with remembering their names, vaguely defined powers and if I'm lucky their one-note character drama.As I go through each member of the team I find myself hating each one. Ikaris: egotistical jerk. Sprite: annoying brat who has the power to make illusions but can't figure out how to make herself look older. Phastos: Always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room. Makkari: Doesn't have a whole lot to do, but could solve all the problems if she just used her powers. Druig: Jerky emo guy who thinks he's better than everyone. Thena: Will randomly flip out and start attacking everyone.Although the visuals are good, I couldn't help but notice that the aspect ratio of the movie kept rapidly changing throughout the film. It was very distracting. The action isn't helmed all that well. It is hard when dealing with super beings that hardly anything can hurt, to make an action scene that is compelling. But at least make an action scene where I can see what is going on.Towards the climax of the film, one of the characters just decides not to participate in the final showdown. Honestly I should have taken my que from him and just bailed on this movie part way through. The finale is your typical Marvel CGI fest with no concrete weight or stakes.As far as the positive goes, It seems to be trying to tell a strange new story with compelling ideas. It just fails to do so.The main characters are pretentious jerks that think they're smarter than everyone . And the fans of this movie come across as pretentious jerks that think they're smarter than everyone."
19,3,"Why was this so boring? It should have been a fun adventure about a bunch of heroes secretly protecting the people from the shadows. But what we got was a story about a couple breaking up, but since they keep eyes each other up dispite whta happens, thay are both idiots who get back together. Something about a celestial being born from centre of Earth, but is actually on the surface and causes zero problems for Earth. The best known actors are practically bit players, who's stories could have been removed completely and not affect the film as a whole, but was just crammed into this one, its a theme of this film I think.Visually it's not bad, some parts are way better than others. But the powers, well... Pointing finger guns does ruin the shot, it doesn't even look good, looks like it sounds, stupid. How does the leader of this group not even understand her powers, but you have about 8 others who fully understand them and so could use them fully. But as predictable as ever, you know why she's the leader, her power will stop whatever was supposed to be a threat.A huge falter for Phase 4, ruined what Shang Chi and Spider-Man paved the way for, let's hope this one is just a dud, and any returning characters make a much better film."
20,8,"Thought provoking and deep message with an interesting story The vocal minority said this movie wasn't good, and they were completely wrong. When I watched this movie I couldn't believe I even considered this movie could be bad, I felt I had been lied to by that vocal minority.The characters are very likable, the story makes you think about life and the universe as a whole, like, where did we come from? Theres twists and turns that will surprise you. The visuals are gorgeous, specially when they tell you about the creation of the universe.If you watch this movie you will not regret it, it expands the marvel universe further. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie."
21,2,"Worst Marvel movie On top of the story being very underwhelming, they decided to inject a completely unnecessary scene of 2 men kissing. Many kids enjoy watching these movies and should not have to be subjected to such controversial topics. Studios need to quit shoving this down peoples throats when it adds nothing to the story."
22,7,"Could have been much more. The cast is amazing, the plot just builds up and then dissipates multiple times. The next could also be amazing, it's up to the creators though. There is a villain that is created, and hyped up throughout the whole movie that ends up doing nothing for the plot of the movie other than adding screentime."
23,3,"Seriously Flawed Ok, So here is a movie that in conception may have been great. Unfortunaly it feels like it went out of its way to try to tick all the ""inclusive"" boxes. Also ther is an issue with the super heros as well. Answer this. These Supreame Beings creat the Ultimate defenders.... why is one Deaf and another have severe mental issues???? That makes zero sense. The movie is what it is and has next to no re-watch or sequil value. Hollywood Woke strikes again."
24,2,"Underwhelming hard 4 The story is lacking and so is the casting/acting. I did not enjoy the tone. Just like Wonder Woman 1984, it feels like the director is trying to make a superhero movie into a soap opera. I do not like soap operas and I do not appreciate it when a superhero movie gets turned into one. These directors should keep making dramas, but since they can't sell tickets that way, they're riding the superhero wave. Great way to spoil a good property."
25,4,"Run of the mill boring movie This was hard to watch. I fear the makers of super hero movies are losing the plot on what it means to be a super hero. Rare do we see one where they are not woefully ""normal"", while those that are not even human, are even worse.It had it's moments, but throughout the whole movie you disconnected to the point of them being a ""family"". One would think after centuries, stronger bonds would have been made. To fight for something bigger, but instead we get the same old drivel of bad betrayal and monster that just want to live. It is base and boring, might as well have watched any run of the mill poorly written and badly executed tv show.The acting is fine, the movie magic is great, but the story is weak and the feeling of super heroes is pretty much completely absent.They could learn from Wonder Woman or Witcher 3."
26,7,B- (high 6). October 21' @Regal Character driven rather than story driven. A bit long for what it is but its character dynamics are great. Solid action sequences. Felt like a solid script. Screenplay way too convenient too often which can be a bit distracting.
27,3,Boring writing and poor character development A few good actors and some great special effects but overall a waste of 2 hours due to boring writing and poor character development.A very sad let down from other movies in the MCU.
28,4,"Any motivation? Idk how this movie was creator. It's like they had 3 days to shoot everything and 1 year to paint beautiful picture.PLOT. Not found. Really. It's just usual line for all the characters. They live together. They don't live together. They have problems. They find each other. There's a traitor. Fight. Happy end. WHAT?CHARACTERS. Not interesting. There is no dramatic scene worth watching and emotional. We have no development of characters, no motivation, no philosophy even and logic in their actions. They just loose one of the most strong characters in the beginning without actually giving understanding WHY. They don't show us why one eternal is stronger than another. There're just facts and we need to believe them.POWER. No comments. Just the ending: they create human being from nothing. Any reason for that? NO. Just the girl wanted to live, let's do it for her, why not?ARISHEM. In the beginning shown as someone powerful. He's supervisor, creator. But he can't control eternals. And he doesn't even judge them. He saw that they tried to kill Celestial and did what... Nothing, exactly! Celestials are SO important for Universe that we can kill them if we just wish it.FINAL OPINION. 2021 year. Are you sure people will eat anything you shoot?"
29,1,"Doesn't deserve a 6.4 What have i just watched?Yes, I've watched the whole movie in about 90 seconds but that's not the point. What's with the Indian dancing on a superhero movie? Far too cheesy and pathetic.Marvel have lost their touch. All about DC."
30,6,"Let's Hear it for the Humans! Before creation Arishem of the Celestials created the first sun (quite a feat given the size plus trillions more) thus bringing light & life into the Universe. Note: Nice close filtered photo of our Sun. Then the Deviants came from deep space (no such thing as a deep location - all equal distant) to feed on intelligent life (why does it have to be intellgent?). Arishem sent Eternals to eliminate the Deviants; led by Ajak. Eternals space ship looks like a triangular piece of countertop granite - propulsion is?. Eternals put on fighting clothes, but oddly female breast sizes increase - a hidden weapon? Fights begin in Mesopotamia (listed as 5000 BC, but should be BCE); move on to Babylonia; Tenochtitlan; Iraq, Amazon; South Dakota; and London today. Asked how long they've been together Sersi incorrectly says 5000 yrs. (should be 7000 for Earth, and millions of years for other places - they sure don't age much).Powers: The usual (overused) force & fire hands, fire eyes, super-fast, mind control, swords. Basic theme is ""Should humans be allowed to exist given their propensity to kill themselves as well as most species while destroying the Earth through consumption, contamination & pollution?"" More so as the population approaches 10 billion."
31,5,"Marvel's first little mudslide Unfortunately, I agree with other professional reviewers on this one...Eternals was quite a bit awkward for my taste.Awkward humor, but good performances. Beautiful visuals, but mediocre battles. There was also so many jumps from present to past, I kind of lost track of how they all connected together. Despite this being a rare chapter in the Marvel Series that wasn't quite what I thought it would be (I felt the same way about my first full tome job too!), I'm still interested to see where the Eternals will go from here, and how they will escape ""judgement"".If I had made this, I think I'd have definitely left out all the flashbacks, and just focused the heroes on here and now, in the present."
32,8,"A Fresh Feel to the Same Marvel Mash I was not overly excited about Eternals as it didn't get great reviews, and didn't link clearly with the overall narrative of the MCU. With that said, although with flaws, Eternals is a fresh take with fresh characters that is a nice change from the other monotonous hack and bang MCU movies out there.The story is strait from a History Channel documentary. Aliens (the Eternals) landed on Earth thousands of years ago to protect humans from deviants and to help them progress. Conveniently, they are sworn to secrecy, and therefore do not play into any other Marvel film to this point. Flash to the present, and danger is poking it's naughty head above water again. Will The Eternals be able to save Earth (as it must be August and all the are on vacation?).There are a lot of characters, and yes, the cast is a United Colours of Benneton collection of very good actors. Rainbow, check, sexuality, check, mental health, check. But unlike other films, these are character traits that seem to flow naturally, and we are not constantly reminded of how 'woke' the movie is. The acting is strong, and the dynamic between the characters is the strength of the film. Just like any team, there are those that work well together, those that have a history, and a wide range of engagement levels. This is all done well, but with so many characters, and a pressure to get the story moving forward, these sometimes feel unexplored.The action and special effects are on par, but often feels like a distraction from the interesting elements of Eternals. This feels like a major balance between director and studio trying to create an action film but include so many characters and script. I myself was way more interested in the story than the action.Why not overly philosophical, I appreciate the each character is unique, and has a chance to share different perspectives on the events. This is not a united team of superheroes, but a group of supreme beings that has a rough history it must come to terms with.Overall, Chloé Zhao does a great job juggling so many balls in the air; and yes, a few do fall to the ground, but those that stay up create a unique and overall interesting movie experience.8/10."
33,4,"A family squabble. With the new phase of Marvel I was quite excited to see how they were going to portray the Eternals. Unfortunately, what I expected to be a thrilling and exciting beginning into the Universe for Marvel turned out to be a massive disappointed. The plot of the story offered nothing interesting except for the destruction of the planet earth that every person watching the movie knew wasn't going to happen. It turned out to be just a family fighting about what they each wanted, to live, to serve or to love. Watching the squabble really made it boring and the deviants in between just a irritation. I did find it quite funny how they ""saved"" the planet."
34,8,"Not more of the same The most inclusive movie of the MCU yet - and while I didn't count, probably after the first Captain America movie, the first that has an overall serious tone to it. That being said, there is still a lot of humor in it. Especially Kumal and his ... ""sidekick"" cover most of the jokes. Which may be the reason he is AWOL at a certain point in time (you'll know which moment that is) - you can hold that against the movie or just go with the flow.Which is true for the inclusiveness - and I am not even talking about the very first sex scene of the MCU. Don't get too excited (or upset), it is quite tame, but might still be reason for kids to be asking some questions (they are just cuddling like we do - could be a possible answer I reckon). You also have the inclusion of a gay character - the movie does not make a big deal out of it. You may when you see a tender male on male kiss. Hopefully you are not someone offended by such things and open minded.And all these things have nothing to do with any ""superhero"" powers (I reckon you can and probably most will call the Eternals superheroes) ... so the movie is quite packed. So much acting talent in front of the camera, so much creative and technical wizardry behind the camera. So there is a point to be made that this could have easily been a Disney Plus show. Who knows, maybe there will be an Eternals inspired Disney Plus show. Could be after the movie plays or in between the arrival of the Eternals and ""Present Day"" (I always wonder what that must look like decades after this was made - anyway).There are certain elements that can be considered cliche, but that would be quite the nitpicking, if you went down that road. Chloe Zhao really held her own and was able to reign in everyone and make a really good movie. Especially on a big screen this will impress you (like on an Imax screen). Because it is different in many ways, this may be viewed more favorably in the future with more context or different expectations.We're still early on in Phase 4 and some may have a better understanding or can guess where the MCU might be heading next. I am talking about fans, I am quite certain Kevin Feige and some others do know of course. At least vaguely. 2,5 hours long and never felt boring or too much. If anything it felt like too little. For what it is (ensemble), it is really well made and condensed.Yes there are logic issues (where were they all this time? Why didn't they appear earlier and so forth?) ... they are adressed of course, but would not really withstand a smell test. But if you are invested in the MCU, the question is: do you really mind? Also this can be seen and watched without any knowledge of anything that came before ... but as always it is way better enjoyed if you have seen the things that came before.Interestingly enough characters from the DC (universe) are being mentioned, like Batmans Alfred or even Superman. So there does not seem to be a mean spirited thought behind that. More like an acknowledgment and a nod to the other universe, that has created so many great stories and characters too. And an admission, but also acknowledgment to the audience and their feelings and intelligence. There is not a void - this could be our universe ... maybe a parallel universe that works that way ... wouldn't that be a great thought/thing to have? And who are we to say that it isn't possible? With Spiderman coming up next - the door will be smashed rather than kicked in - and I am really looking forward to that one - hoping to keep the ""spoilers"" far away from myself. Until then, don't forget: there are two bonus scenes (mid and after credit), like with most MCU movies."
35,1,Disgusting and long After the first ten minutes I wanted all characters to vanish. The story can be told in half the time and some of the characters didn't do anything. Just making the movie embarrassing.
36,4,"Cinematic Vomit Eternals is an incoherent mess that over stays its welcome. There is no pacing or structure. Just scene after scene jumping back and forth through history and the present to try develop a connection with the characters. Completely unsuccessfully. The characters are totally forgettable backed by awful performances. Barry Keoghan as Druig gave one of the worst displays in acting I've ever seen. Every time he came on screen all I could think was slurry uglier Ferris Bueller and just prayed someone would punch him.The entire movie devolves into so much campy CGI it just looks like a cartoon. Then when you think it's finally over and they've won, there's another 20 minutes of crying and hugging and nonsense. Terrible movie."
37,2,"The Eternals will return? Please noooo! Marvel, please don't make another one of these turkeys. Just pretend this movie was never made. Or it happened in a multi-verse far away from the main one which is inhabited by characters I like such as the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Avengers & Spider-Man. Despite volcanos etc popping up no existing Marvel characters appear in this film so this makes sense.Please don't pollute the MCU with its ridiculous messy mythology or over populate it with these boring, bland characters. The Eternals are like old, pompous, serious power rangers.Most of the action in the film is the Eternals fighting the Deviants (not sexual), CGI video game like monsters, who randomly show up and are the reason for the eternals existence. Such lame antagonists. The rest of the movie is politics between the Eternals who apparently sit around dormant for 1000s of years between these Deviant attacks.I'm amazed we got through this movie, although I did nod off at one point. When ""The Eternals will return"" text came up on screen at the end, everyone I was with groaned ""No!"" in unison. It was like a threat rather than something to get excited about. Marvel, if you have to, please leave it an eternity before making a sequel. Unless the sequel involves killing all the Eternals. P. S. The cameos at the end were annoying, not cool too."
38,6,"Long but okay Not as bad as most reviews said. Deviants' CGI could have been way better. Length or movie duration shorter - there were too many scopes of improvements in storyline. But all in all not expect more from Marvel now in terms of a ""good movie"" but just entertaining passing of time - this kind of deliverrd."
39,6,"The eternal dies Absurd story, who wrote it is definitely misogynist.Again a gif who created the universe again a man.The all story once you read the first sentence lost all interest. Given a chance do not go better, gods being giving the role to help humanity against ... aliens, only called differently, and again they have to kill then all because the creator says so, againTherefore is like watching a children book."
40,1,What was the point Too long. Too complicated. Boring. Story line all over the place. Angelina Jolie annoying as usual. They made a massive point of a dagger at the beginning then never referred to it again. The Egyptians and Romans had guns??? What was that all about? The credit spoiler introduced a couple of really irritating characters and nothing else.dont waste your time. The story line can't carry 2 plus hrs.
41,3,"Disappointing - a ponderous mish-mash Was looking forward to this, that magnifies the deflation having sat through it. For such a star studded cast many of whom are gifted performers, this is a terrible indictment of them collectively. Constipated dialogue, tortuous plotline and an aimless hip-hop through history are just three of the gashes scarring this movie. The effects are well done as is a minimal requirement from Marvel these days, but they cannot save this. Perhaps the ensemble is too big to be introduced in one go - they were each gradually introduced as the story developed, but we never got to know any of them in any depth and therefore did not care what happened to them."
42,1,"Not a nessessary watch anyway Yeah, it s#&ks. Marvel's first real flop. But the good news is that you do not need to watch this to follow the current Marvel universe. And I think they made it that way because they knew this film would strike out."
43,3,"Eternal Drag of Time Promising title, some good to great effects, but the story is blatantly boring written. The only thing you look forward are the computer generated fights to give you a break and wake you up. And those become pretty lifeless too with the boss fight being the worse of all.Great cast assemble, although there wasn't a deep enough dive into each character. Cersi who was the main character, is ""eternal"" friends with a group of select people who fight evil. We learned that she had a 5000 year long relationship with Icarus and he suddenly disappeared. Then, she works at a school (we know as it is shown for 1 minute) and she has a new boyfriend. She also has the superpower of converting things. That's all.Around the same is each other character introduced.This is too long of a movie and how it got executed it is felt even longer. Not really a connection there with any of the characters. Very likely I'll never watch it a second time and definitely not gonna watch Eternals 2."
44,5,"So-so Stunning visuals and vistas. The plot was very standard ""ancient aliens"" fare. Just when the story starts fleshing out the true potential of it's plot it is unceremoniously over. It felt rushed and slightly unearned. Performances are decent but no real stand out other than Kango who is taken out of the film for no discernible reason other than the characters ""finger guns"" are no match against the main protagonist. Decent story steeped in wasted potential."
45,3,"A simple minded person, wrote the dialog and moral The dialog is at best simplistic. The moral is the moral, of a 12 year old.Why does a so called ""eternal"" like Druid, not understand that if you force your will on people, they are not free to chose. If you lived for thousands of years, you'd know this. You'd be Hitler, Stalin, Mao all in one.The moral is Disney material, but Disney manages to get the moral of the story written into to story.This move is in no way subtle. It tells you who is bad, and who is good. It's a movie, with a A list cast, but it's still just a B movie.Avoid it."
46,4,"Rubbish I refuse to acknowledge this as a Marvel movie. Instead, I'll pretend that I never watched it or heard of it. Nothing about this experience made sense. Not the plot. Not the script. Not the characters. It's as if we were plopped in the middle of a movie that had started hours ago and it was up to us to catch up and figure things out."
47,1,"Overrated borefest To say this was awful would be a compliment. Just putrid. A waste of time. Acting was horrible and the writing? Let's just say this is a movie for toddlers. Every male character in this movie is a whiny needy lovestruck loser. Too long, yet it goes nowhere. On the positive side, if you can't sleep, 5 minutes of this borefest will knock you out cold for hours."
48,1,"Nausea will catch you from every single such ugliness. Pfuj. Nausea will catch you from every single such ugliness. Pfuj. 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧😂😂😂😂😂🙊🙉🙈🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 Tasteless, stomach-turning, nonsensical, anti-humanity film. Movie !?"
49,3,"Somewhat disappointing even when going in with lower expectations No character development, wooden acting, endless inconsistencies within the MCU, ridiculous predictable outcomes. Too much focus on woke checkboxes and too little on writing and directing. Disney is destroying Marvel, much like it did the Star Wars universe and their own animated classics. Walt is turning over in his grave, and we suffer his unwanted legacy."
50,1,"I'm trying to figure it out An arduous 2.5 hour ""Hollywood correct"" borefest of a confusing cast of characters portraying Marvel's version of the Power Rangers. Not sure what to think except it was long and I didn't like it."
51,7,"Eternals Presenting a new aspect of the MCU proves to be a brilliantly ambitious, yet mixed experience throughout. Marvel has always succeeded in introducing new characters to its universe, further proving it through this film. Each character is given interesting personality traits and ideologies that lend themselves to a personal feel to the film, which most other MCU films have never fully explored. It is only furthered by the entertaining and endearing chemistry provided by the notable cast. The powers of each character are brilliantly utilized to provide visually breathtaking sequences of action and world-building. Despite the amount it tries to accomplish, this film, for the most part, succeeds in illustrating the new aspect of the universe Marvel wishes to explore, creating an existential insight into the world outside of the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However, it's also because of this aspect that makes the film at times feel bloated with many pockets of the story that feel unexplored. Although this can be used for further sequels, the amount of story that is thrown on screen may at times feel overwhelming with brand new information being provided with limited screen time. The aspect ratio can also be distracting at times, shifting from gigantic IMAX visuals to standard camera shots without flow in its transition. Despite the number of positives, the film manages to accomplish, the over bloated nature of the film's story feels akin to something that should be made for the small screen, making for a mixed yet interesting viewing experience."
52,6,"alright but had more potential This movie contains a lot of both good and bad elements to it. To start off, I really like the scenery, the colors and the occasional historical references that it contains. I really liked how it showed how the eternals got on with the different populations. Other than that, there are some major flaws. I think that Bill Skarsgard is brilliant at playing villains (as we saw in IT) and seeing him play such an under-developed and plane character in this movie disappointed me. I don't think that I am the only person who thinks he should be re-cast. I also thought that the love relationship was simple.I personally don't know how they are going to fit the eternals with all the other characters in The MCU but I am really interested in what they are going to do with Starfox (Harry Styles)."
53,2,"Garbage My first movie that i reviewed here was Godzilla. Why? The worst i watched in a cinema.Now, again with Eternals!!!My first problem is: cast members (Salma & Angelina). Come on Marvel, this is a golden opportunity to youngsters to shine, yet you hire almost retired actress to do the job. The problem is, they are investing in this movie and more parts are coming up.The movie lacks depth in story. Villains are monsters!!!! Any normal movie can have monsters as villains. Weak story. Movie is not emotional; you dont feel attached to it. More or less, the movie is just flexing super powers.Yeah, another sad attempt in making a copy of superman (after captain Marvel)!!!!! Yeah Ikarus. Very stupidly done. Moreover, we have a marvel Version of the flash. Yet this is the only character that i loved in the movie.I am a huge Marvel fan, but this movie was a let down. Even old movie like Captain America was waaaay better than this."

When watching this you get the feeling that the whole series is designed to promote different sexual orientations and who knows what else, this is pure bottom. Superheroes are slowly being destroyed, in a few years they will become a mockery in the movie world and just another symbol of promotion such as; rainbow, dr who ... etc. 😨🤢"
56,3,"An embarrassment to Marvel Cinematic This movie is a total waste and lengthy.Poor story though graphics were brilliant I give it a rating of 3 out 10.However, it's an embarrassment to Marvel Cinematic."
57,3,"Awkward, boring, joyless, waste of film making resources, talent, and audience This movie is so poorly written and edited that frankly I'm stunned. The amount of talent in this cast and production should have been next level... but unfortunately, the writing and the character development is so joyless and superficial that it ruins just about any chance of redemption by any of these amazing actors. The tone oscillates between dour navel gazing, 'balanced' by poorly timed jokes masquerading as the 'super hero's are just like us' trope (did they just use a checklist to write this film?)This was a massive missed opportunity to write complex characters existing with the wisdom and experiences of millennia... instead we got this movie.My only conclusion is that this film was written by people who think writing fantasy and super hero stories is 'easy'. They are so hard to write well... as this movie sadly demonstrates. The best stories comes from fundamental truths, retold in fantastical and new ways. This movie tells us nothing. It's a collection of superficial self reflection one liners, delivered without greater meaning of purpose, lazy action sequences, and zero heart."
58,6,"This is the last time I am watching a Marvel movie again. Nice graphics, stupid scenario.. I mean how many superheroes are in this planet anyway.One eternal is flash 2? The other is Mr. Gizmo?I'm do sick and tird this childish universe."
59,8,"Don't listen the bad reviews Don't listen the bad reviews the movie is definitely worth watching. The story have the good pace,plot twist and CGI is amazing. Casting is very interesting, Angelina Jolie definitely carry the movie and I think it's can be more better if Angelina play the leader of the group Sersi instead of Gemma Chan. I don't underestimate Gemma but i think the main character must be more talented actor like Angelina. The worst thing is poorly connection with characters."
60,1,"Oh dear, Disney what have you done. Wokeness aside. This is the worse Marvel film, since Howard the duck. It had some great actors, but they were made to look bad, with bad directing and an awful script. Let's hope Disney, brings us some Marvel films we deserve again. Thank god for Spiderman, thanks Sony."
61,1,Not a good watch Casting should have been done better... with this cast it's very difficult to connect with the movie... Gemma Chan should have played Thena coz Sersi needs star value to play Angelina Jolie might be the best option for that role... still casting is a huge negative for this movie... those two Indian characters omg irritating... being an Indian felt irritated on their slang... why in the hell in all Hollywood movies Indians talk the same irritating slang... Hollywood film makers need to go and see the other parts of India to learn how people speak english... we have millions and millions of people who speaks better and beautiful English... India is not like how you guys stereotype... Hollywood please wake up...
62,7,Eternals wasn't that bad I couldn't watch this movie in theaters because my country didn't allow it *barf* so I had to wait for blue ray and in the while I was waiting in I kept hearing people in the internet saying that it was shit and saying stuff like don't watch this it crap believe me I hated it and stuff like that so when the blue ray came out I had a really low expectations for it and when I watched I was suprised it wasn't that bad I actually enjoyed it and I was so disappointed from not getting disappointed and from now on am gonna trust marvel more they know what there doing.
63,10,It was a really good movie A lot better than we expected it kept you into the movie didn't want to go to the restroom. We are definitely looking forward to part 2. Gemma Chan played the part well.
64,1,If Marvel Produced an Overdone Bollywood Flick Such a waste of good actors. Bad script and too much melodrama. Story does not make sense and was truly awful.It felt like watching a cheesy B-movie. I felt sick watching it. What a waste.Really really bad direction. Nothing good to write about.
65,8,"This is the best MCU movie in years Here's the short version of what I think about Eternals: it's the best MCU movie since Guardians of the Galaxy, and I wouldn't be too surprised if the main reason a lot of people don't like it is because it's tonally different from a lot of the other MCU movies.Especially early on, Eternals doesn't depend on a lot of exposition heavy scenes. It's trying to tap into more visual forms of storytelling. Really, the closest thing it gets to heavy exposition is a very Blade Runner-esque text prologue at the start.Eternals is also much less reliant on comic relief than other MCU movies. It's not totally humourless and it does have a couple of comic relief moments, but it's not like Guardians of the Galaxy or Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings where the comic relief stuff is injected into every single scene, even when it's not really needed.Both of these things are good changes for the franchise. Generally speaking, audiences are smart enough to follow what's happening without having every little thing explained to them, and the comic relief aspects of the MCU movies (especially the recent ones) have tended to be the weakest elements.The other big difference between Eternals and other MCU movies is that this one has a slower pace. I feel like this is much more of a mixed bag.On one hand, there are a couple of points where this slower pacing does make the movie feel bloated. Eternals could have been twenty minutes shorter and it would have been better for it.On the other hand, if only fifteen or twenty minutes needed to be shaved off for this movie to be better, then it's much less bloated than other recent superhero movies.Plus, I feel like this slower pace allows Eternals to develop its characters more fully. Eternals does better at character development than the overwhelming bulk of the MCU stuff to date.None of this is to say that the movie is some kind of Earth shattering intellectual experience that'll change your life forever or anything like that. The story is still pretty simple, and it's still dealing with a lot of the found family type elements that previous MCU movies have dealt with. However, I feel like this is a slightly more mature look at that concept, and I hope the franchise decides to continue down this road.In terms of the action sequences, Eternals does well. Each of the team has their own powers, and they're able to use them effectively. They also generally feel like much more of a cohesive team than The Avengers, and are generally able to work together without acting like children. The action sequences in this movie are some of the best in the MCU to date.Overall, I think Eternals is the best MCU movie in years. It's a break from other MCU movies tonally speaking, but this is a good thing because it'll allow the franchise to grow. Really, my only major complaint is that it's taken Disney this long to come out with a superhero movie that attempts to go down this road stylistically."
66,3,"This movie is... unique Felt like it was shoving some things down my throat.Def didn't enjoy it, at all.Only good character was Gilgamesh.Sprite was cringy, Ikarus was cringy, everyone was cringy. (besides Gilgamesh ofc) Was originally gonna give it a 1, but Gilgamesh made me give it a 3."
67,3,"Unwatchable This film tells you, in the first 20 minutes, that you should be working on that thing you've been putting off.And if you've completed all your tasks, you definitely have better things to watch for entertainment. Horrid."
68,4,"Forgot the story. This is so terrible. Spent too much time on ""woke"" heroes that they forgot to include a story. What story there was could have been and hour long tv episode. Predicable and tedious in the extreme."
69,6,"The worst marvel universe movie in recent years This is easily the most boring marvel movie in recent years. The characters are uninteresting, the actors don't manage give any depth to characters the plot is boring, it feels that the eternals don't fit in the whole marvel universe, They even look like some silly power rangers without helmets. Sadly its most likely that we will see them in some way in the future sagas of marvel bigger story because thats the way they build things. Personally the whole eternals could just travel to edge of galaxy and mind their own business and not spoil things from the otherwise well built marvel universe."
70,3,"Marvel really dropped the ball on this one- too many areas of suck, poor morals but Marvel used it to tick some boxes Marvel movies have been consistently good, or even great. This is the first one that isn't -in fact I suspect Marvel used this film more to tick progressive boxes than make a good film (which they ofcourse will cut for Chinese audiences like the hypocrites they are).What is worst about the film is it's morals - they're all over the place in terms of the eternals reason for being, their conflicts against it and their reasons for not being involved in human conflict (well unless they just feel like it). It's hard to get attached to the film.Fight scenes aren't great eitherThis film is way too long. If you're going to make a film 3 Hours or better be good. Although it did a good job of setting up the characters, the problem is none of them, except the Bollywood star and the kid Spike are interesting. Cersi the main character of the film is so forgettable when she's not in a scene you forget she exists. The big names Jolie and Hayek are poor and bland. And what a surprise the big baddie is a straight white male.The only good thing about the film is it does still have some of that Marvel humour, especially with the Valet but he can't save this stinker. Maybe mocking those who weren't a fan of some of the films aspects was not the way to go."
71,2,"Wasted 2 hours of my time The movie had nice visuals, obviously marvel is very good with that but the storyline and characters and everything within just... bored the he'll of my life... I really didn't like it. It's one of the movies I'd never wanna go back and watch again."
72,5,"Very Slow and just doesn't get going Was interested in seeing what this was going to be like. But nothing exciting happened in the first 30 minutes. Nor the first 60, 90 or 120... In the last 30 minutes then it gets a little more exciting. But not where i went. Wow...Will be watching that again. It was almost as if it was made by DC."
73,4,"Boring. Too forced. Not engaging. Oh boy...Marvel had quite a coup when they managed to hire Oscar winning director Zhao for Eternals. This would be a MCU film of a whole new level. It is. But not in a good way. The film is overlong and its plot (about the end of the world...again) doesn't deserve it. It diverse cast (there is something for everyone to identify with! How cool!) feels so forced and ""look how progressive we are"" it is annoying. The Defiants (horrible monsters) are not interesting at all. The humor is not at the same level of most other MCU films. No...this definitely did not live up to its expectations. And yes...it is definitely one of the worst MCU films."
74,2,"not sure what this was but it's not Kirby's Eternals It's sad when a 200 dollar movie based on Kirby's writing doesn't feel anything like Kirby.This movie fails on several fronts, it's badly written badly directed athe acting is horrendous.For the 10 minutes Hayek was phoning it in, Jolie confirmed her status of a has been that nobody cares about, the rest are just as bad.What's the purpose of a def and mute robot, what abot a 12 year old girl that wants to grow up so she can have ""relations"" with humans, how do robots live life's... These are all questions left unanswered, there are some fun points that lead nowhere like the machine that's a Bollywood star.But the sadest thing is the color palette if the director read a single Kirby book they'd seen the bright colors Kirby used in his books this is just dark and flat.The story is dull and moves with no pace an hour in nothing happened.If you haven't seen this you're lucky if you have Disney owes you three hours of your life back, if you're one of those people that need to see it put it in the background while you do something more productive like watching paint dry."
75,3,"Why did I watch this? For me this is the worst MCU movie. It's hard to find the connection. The characters are the annoying ones. Too lengthy to keep on watching, it just bored me."
76,7,"Not bad. Watched the movie late and it was not that bad but in my opinion, it was way better than Shang chi. Was a bit boring so i skipped alot. Pretty average movie."
77,3,"So much wasted money It feels like this movie cost 15 million dollars and 50 of those were given to four eight year old boys and a 12 year old girl to write the script. CGI is... Fine... They got a bunch of expensive, but not particularly good actors to act out this plot hole filled, unnecessarily overly politically correct, poorly produced peace of garbage they had the audacity to call a Marvel movie. Is this what Marvel is going to be from now on?"
78,5,"Such a shame, missed the target. I feel like this was 3 movies whittled down to the 1. There's so much going on but the story doesn't gel. The characters are not established so the audience doesn't connect or feel involved enough to do so. It's like Marvel were trying too hard to make the film work and tragically failed. This could and probably should have been split in to a few movies in order to flesh the story out. It feels as though the writers weren't allowed enough time to develop the characters, or the it back story and this is proven at the very end of the film's credits when 2 more are thrown in just because. I knew nothing about the Eternal's and I feel let down by whoever commissioned this.It was so great to see a deaf superhero, a gay black superhero, and an Indian superhero and the wonderful cultural heritage of the Indian people, albeit briefly. But it's more of a shell of a movie than anything of substance.I'm left simply disappointed."
79,4,"Caricaturish portrayal of Indians put me off massively As is with most Hollywood movies, there wasn't even an attempt to portray something relevant or reflective of the society, instead they went ahead with the old tried and tested, let's reduce them to a Bollywood dance number and a lame sidekick.I was so excited for Kunal to take it up as a superhero in a Marvel movie, only be to be utterly disappointing by Marvel going the opposite way and making his character another caricature full of stereotypes. They can do better, as they've clearly shown with Shang-Chi, but I guess they don't feel the need to, and for that, the director gets 4 stars from me, I loved the cast otherwise and the unique aspects of their characters that they brought to the story."
80,2,"Oh dear! Not very good at all. All the potential but no brains. I can't understand why the writers expect anyone to enjoy this, silly storyline and as most films do now they give the characters a silly side and add a silly sidekick, grow up and give us proper believable characters even fantasy ones."
81,7,A bad mix of MCU and DCEU The director said that she was inspired by Snyder's DC films. This movie then comes out as a bad mix of the Marvel formula and the Snyder one. Flashbacks are aplenty but still not enough to makes us care for the characters. Their motivations seem spontaneous and the climax is dull at best. I'd suggest that you watch this movie to keep up with the MCU. The visuals are great as well.
82,4,Not worth the time Yet another marvel flix which the fans would have thought to be another gem in marvel's history but yet we all agree how disappointing the movie was. The story line was so basic and so plain that yet the action scenes of the movie couldn't make it up to the audience and make them intrigued to watch the movie more than once. You'll not find any kind of excitement building in you as you start watching the movie yes the scene and certain locations used in the movie are beautiful which is the only good thing. The movie tells us how eternals came into being (earth) but yet most of the audience I'm sure wanted to watch what was the history of celestials and how eternals are a part of celestials. Yet what we watch was the fight between eternals and deviants (not a great plot in the first instalment of the eternal franchise) so yeah now the movie is available on Hotstar and everyone can watch it but well still not worth the time if you are just watching for time pass. If you are a marvel fan and know that this movie will connect to some other movie/series then do watch it for a better future.
83,1,"Eternal garbage I love almost every Marvel movie that has been made. This movie makes me ashamed to be a mcu fan. This movie wants us to connect to characters we have never seen before, but gives us nothing to connect to. And then they start killing off characters and we're supposed to feel something for these characters? The whole movoe os jist terrible. The cgi doesn't even pass for a movie made in 2021. The pacing is terrible, unbearably long. I had to watch in 2 separate times because I got so bored. Made me lose faith in marvel until No way home comes and blows it out of the park. Every character in this movie makes no sense excpet the fast girl and the mind control guy. We're supposed to believe that these people were created to defend earth and can't defend themselves at all. Bad, just bad."
84,8,"Disappointing but Tried For an All-Star Cosmic Product The Sets and Actors are plucked from all the Great SciFi / Fantasy in the Marvel Multiverse and in ""Lost "" and like Unified Field Theory it never jelled into a simple all-powerful answer, but it didn't hold back from Trying."
85,5,"They need to do better I was excited based on what we were told the film would be about and it seemed to be critical for this MCU phase going forward. That said, it was one of the worst MCU films I've seen to date, and I've seen them all. There's been a couple of duds but perhaps none as boring, poorly conceived and executed... at least during the first half of the film. Like a soccer match this film was a tale of two half's, totally different in impact and quality. For a good stretch the main characters came off as weak for so-called ""Eternal"" beings and seemed to have little meaningful purpose, lacking even a modicum of the wisdom that should come from existing as long as they had on earth. The film becomes mildly interesting about halfway thru, then the action sets in and improves a great deal thru the end. I'm not quite sure if it wasn't because the bar already established was so low to make it seem so.I knew this was in trouble early in the film. Too much emphasis on the wrong things. Not a bit of story had been told nor a single character developed before we were already watching eye-rolling styled action shots of Angelina Jolie doing hammy poster poses for the camera. I was most disappointed in her casting here. She was/is a distraction in this type of ensemble cast film. Further, like her or not she can't act unless she's portraying the character she's worked hardest at being her entire career... ""Angelina Jolie"". If she MUST be included in the MCU they'd have done better to cast her in a cameo or as a one-dimensional villain.But for me Jolie was just one of many poor choices and is certainly not all to blame. There's an eery sense of speciousness to this film regarding its intent. Even the cinematography was poor as nearly the entire film was too dark and difficult to watch. As mentioned the best part of the entire film was about halfway thru with the speedster beating the bejesus out of the alpha character who had betrayed them. Finally something somewhat meaningful was happening in the scenes to follow. The plot and characters began to show purpose. If you managed to stay awake this long you were home free. There are still a ton of questions worth asking, tho one knows in the MCU they often get answered with future installments. I sincerely hope they do a better job next time out."
86,8,Eternal is the run time. Enjoyed the characters but the plot was subpar.Good effects mixed with cheap CGI.A good addition to the universe with something new but needs development.Probably a sequel in the works To flesh out Bare bones idea.
87,5,"Confused.com Visually this was a great film. Good cinematography, a very good cast, Angelina Jolie looking beautiful, Richard Madden gorgeous- BUT I didn't have a diddly squat clue as to what was going on. Who was Tiamat? I thought the robot guy was Arishem? Or was he Tiamat??I usually enjoy Marvel and DC, but this was just far too confusing and lonnnngggg.Unfortunately, with the appearance at the end of the film of Harry Styles as Eros, a sequel seems to be on the cards. I think I'll give it a miss."
88,3,"Here's to an unnecessarily bloated second part. Kevin Feige owes me 3(!) hours of my life!The Cast: probably the most emotionless and unsympathetic cast in Marvel's history so far, and after ""Shang-Chi"" that's saying something!Maybe the backstories were too surreal to thrill me, I don't know, in any case I didn't feel connected, didn't feel entertained.Even Angelina's performance disappointed me badly. She usually stands completely behind her character, but here I missed the fire.Kit Harrington was one of the few bright spots, playing such a wonderful anti-Jon Snow that I have to give the film a star just because of him, and of course the end credits scene. A kobold introducing Harry Styles, hilarious.The Plot: Unfortunately, the story is nothing new. Just more stretched out - we're slowly getting into Hobbit spheres. The Eternals, who at times remind me strongly of their egotistical counterparts from ""The Boys"", have to say goodbye to their normal lives, get together to save the world. Stars for creativity: zero!The worst thing, however, is that it takes almost the entire movie to do this. Unnecessary flashbacks and endless talking included. ""Only"" 30 minutes lasts the so-called finale. I also found the fact that the film is set in modern times disappointing. Which once again throws the MCU into question for me. Why did the Eternals just stand there and watch during Thanos? They couldn't possibly have all disappeared. They are not real living beings! They were created. They could have helped!Anyway.In short, the movie left me wondering. Where has the charm of the Marvel saga gone? The excitement you feel from the very first minute? Where are the actors who, in addition to all the seriousness, were not at a loss for a joke or a saucy response? The ones who portrayed the character as if they actually were that person. I miss the lightness of the past films. The heroes from the neighborhood. Who were real. Without any hidden motives, without all the little games, without back and forth...Anyway.Here's to an unnecessarily bloated second part."
89,7,"Don't listen to the haters, it was a great watch! After hearing so much bad reviews for this movie, I almost didn't watch it. But now after watching it TWICE, I have to say the reviews are flawed! This was a really good movie. From the story, the effects, the costumes, right down to the fight scenes which were just took dope and watching Angelina kick@$$ was so sexy. I've missed her in such action roles. I in particularly loved how they took us on a journey of discovering who the Eternals were and why they existed. I also loved how each Character had a moment to shine. Everyone played their role beautifully, the only let down for me was the forced gay character in there. Aside that, the movie made sense and I can't wait to see how they fight the big guy in the next one."
90,9,"It's beautifully shot Yes it's very different than other Marvel movies, but it's shot beautifully. I regretted that I didn't watch it on a big screen. I watched it twice, and liked it even more the second time. The cast is really diverse, which I really like. The director came from Indie film, but Eternals showed off her skills and aesthetics really well. There are so many amazing details in the movie. Sure people said it's different than other movies. I meant if all marvel movies are looking similar, what's interesting about it right?! Especially when you showing the future of the MCU, this starts off the right path. I am looking forward to the second one."
91,6,"eternals is ok, had a few twist on storyline. the action scene also handle very good. Eternals is ok, had a few twist on storyline. The action scene also handle very good.Watched all other marvel cinematic universe movie.However after read so many comments also say eternals movie boring. And the box office performance also not so good, part of it relate to it release in pandemic stage. But i before guess part of it , may relate to the movie boring.After all of the above reasons, make me lost interest to watch and not plan to watch eternals.But finally, in order to know the story line for future mcu movie.I choose to watch it.May be becasue don't have any expectation or already expect it very boring. Eternals movie gave me some surprise. And feel the movie quite good. As mcu always style, had a few funny part, had a few twist.Just first few mins a bit boring and slow, then after that, start make me want to watch.Actually the final fight scene is impressive.The script is ok, some dialoge also interesting, have many link to different mcu movie. And seems got some big revenue on product placement???becasue sound so obvious.The ending music part, use the graphic, antique, history wall picture to connect them with eternals. I feel that idea is quite good.I would say , if u are mcu fans, eternals <-must watch.Even to non-fans, the movie also ok and intersting."
92,6,Sadly not as good as other Marvels Max I can give 6.5/10 because this i a mega invested film but still lack of the mega standard.Its just another ordinary movie with little punches.The special effects are just ordinary and the storyline also nothing much anew.
93,5,"Not good Marvel movie One of the worse movies from MCU, at least for me. There are many characters, the group looks like Avengers, but the representation of all groups, races, types of people is obvious. Also this film does not have a definite antagonist, the story is confused, there is a lot of explanation throughout the film. Towards the end there was too much CGI for my taste. Somewhat entertaining movie, but that's it."
94,3,"unnecessary overwhelming The eternal are immortal being, created by celestial arishem to protect human against deviant,I tough this movie are just about eternal fighting deviant, but then I see this eternal having so much problem fighting these deviant.I'm flabbergasted by this first, the story is jumping here and there, giving a bit of story for the eternal, with context that I quite didn't care.In the end the purpose of those are just giving a little flick about their love story. Then again I don't care, these beings is immortal, having relationship for thousand year with each other is just overwhelming and can't connect with human capabilities.Then the story introduce us with the end of the world cliché, we must gather again to solve this problem, then get revealed that the eternal are in love with this world, this is raising the problem about the cosmic continuity, eternal have to decide the future of the earth, the member has conflicting decision and they fight, and 1 of the deviant come in mid fight. Because why not.Tbh, this movie is just too much for the introduction of eternal, I tough eternal will just fight deviant."
95,8,"Not bad I understand that many people hate this movie. It's not like a superhero movie, but deep down it is. I didn't have any expectation before watching the movie and enjoyed watching it. I didn't feel bored at all during this 2.5 hours. It's a superhero movie with more sentiment."
96,4,"Weakest MCU movie Nothing about the movie makes me as the viewer connect to it... the story is lackluster, the characters are stale. Plot holes all over the place and parts of the story and characters that seem to have no real meaning or the meaning got lost. Also most of the dialogues and conversations are hardly above that of the average tv show. The few characters that did have some actual personality had minor parts in the story. The thing that holds the movie up a bit is the mostly good looking special effects. Marvel can do so much better than this."
97,2,Very bad choice= very bad movie! No logic= bad movie!!! It is very bad unfortunately not logical story!Because it is sci-fi story don't mean you can make up story up and not logical and play with history and this! What wast time!Good movie it is not always about good acting's or other things most important is logic in story giving meaning! I'm disappointed much of it is special effects! Don't make that movie igen!
98,4,"Marvel's Justice League Ready for the coldest take ever? This would've been a better miniseries. Instead, its two and a half hours spent desperately trying to explain these overly generic feeling characters called Eternals that are... Eternal. We bounce back and forth in time so much there's no cohesion or sense to it. We learn of their abilities sort of but barely understand any of the relationships or characters.It feels like such a shame. I want to like these characters, I want to care about what's going on. There are fun ideas here but even with 2.5 hours of time none of it feels lived in or earned. When the end comes around, I still don't know who these people are, I may have two or three names actually locked in. There are visuals that I appreciate. The representations of the powers are generic but weirdly feel fun. A couple of the powers themselves are used to interesting effect despite them pretty much just looking like rejects from Doctor Strange. There are giant alien machine beings that show up and look properly imposing and yet... How no impact on the world at all?This feels like a victory lap for Marvel, except instead of crossing the finish line the wheels fall off, and smoke billows from the engine at the halfway mark. They throw together a big team of godlike heroes with next to no build-up or explanation for most of them, they mention both Batman and Superman in the film. The Superman reference is even directed at a character that flies, has super strength, and laser eyes. It feels so much like Marvel trying to show up DC and in the process, they fall for all the same problems. The mention of DC characters felt especially jarring as well.Such a disappointment to have a movie with a fun concept be such a complete miss. At seemingly every turn it makes the most generic and underwhelming of choices. I want to like it but it feels like a complete nothing of a movie. It reminded me of Thor: Dark World but it isn't as aggressively bad. To quote Dean Winchester, Eternals is so vanilla it makes vanilla seem spicy."
99,5,"Disappointed. Disappointed. The only characters that I can relate to are Thena and Gilgamesh. The others are all disappointing. So many characters are introduced, but there is no character development. I've waited so long to watch this and I'm very disappointed. And some of the scenes just don't make sense. In this one scene, Phastos suddenly screams, ""Not yet!"" to Sersi, but Sersi never pushed him to give an answer. Then, in another scene, when the Deviants suddenly attack the village in the forest, Sersi doesn't look surprised or panicked. She just suddenly asks people to hide. Then, in another scene, when Ikaris attacks Druig, Sersi and Makkari have a delayed surprise. In the cave also, Thena suddenly says, ""I remember."" And... so? Remember what? 😂 Anyway, this movie is so disappointing."
100,8,"Loved it Most of these bad reviews are just people who want the same movie spoon fed to them over and over again. Something that isn't exactly what they want is automatically bad.... But this movie was solid, had a lot of mythos packed into it, which I think they did a good job with. Good action, decent actors, and a thought provoking story, I didn't watch it for the longest time bc of how bad the reviews were and I'm kicking myself now for that."
101,3,"Vomit Inducing Woketopianism Can this woke, vapid, slow to the point of tears, with a ""bar scene from Star Wars"" inspired cast ever end? It's as if the casting director's pay was based on selection of cast and their roles to hit every possible permutation of identity politics intersectionality ever dreamt up by intellectually weak but emotionally driven leftist in the west."
102,8,"Give it a shoot I went into the movie with very low expectations, mostly because if the many bad reviews, but I came out actually liking it. Its definitely not your typical marvel movie, and it also doesn't feel like one but it's enjoyable. I had a great time watching it, and my main complaint is that the movie failed to flesh out all the characters, but I'm certain they will do that in the future. If you're hesitant to watch the movie, I'd say just go for it, give it a try and see if you like it!"
103,1,Woke = Broke I give it 3 starts for the cinematography and that's is. This is one of those rare MCU movies that should be throw into a drawer forever. I mean the director couldn't just throw a woke comment or something. Instead she went fool throttle. The MCU just shoud ignore this movie and keep going as if it never happened. I can say that the only good thing was Angelina Jolie's character and acting and Harrington introduction as the Black Knight. Other than that the movie is trash.
104,9,"Turn out Great At first, I thought this movie is not going to be great. So, I did not go to saw it at the cinema. I waited to watch it on Disney plus since marvel is in Disney. Then I kinda forgot about it. Weeks later, a friend of mine asked us to watch ""Eternals"" together like a Netflix party but Disney.I was Amazed.(Might contain some spoilers) Every actor and actress did a splendid job. Especially, Don Lee as Gilgamesh. I love how he really sent the vibe of Strong and Powerful. But I want some Characters to have more roles in the movie like, Druig (Barry), Makkari (Lauren) The plot is ... not predictable I would say it is not like other marvel movies there is something about it. Like it is not a superhero that we usually see Chloé Zhao did a wonderful job bringing many characters to the MCU. I want to see how each character will develop in the following movies hope that Ikaris, Ajak, and Gilgamesh will be back somehow... The CGI and visual is amazing. Marvel really did great in this movie."
105,4,"Full of Air A movie that was built up to be great, but in reality not so much. The visuals were amazing and as always it's nice to see new superheroes along with their story. But in the grand scheme of things, the movie missed it's mark.Eternals, was slow in pace. The entire movie was basically about a long, drawn out love story that had next to no feeling to it. The film slowly introduced the cast one-by-one, without actually showing much or even giving much, but some how kept going. And when it finally started to pick up during the very end, the fight scene was way too short. The viewer barley got to see the extant of the abilities the new superheroes possessed. What was worse of all was how little Angelina Jolie's part was in the movie. And that there was no real chemistry between the cast/team. These people have spent thousands of years together on earth and yet they all come across as strangers without much feeling. It feels cold, and Angelina felt the coldest, like she didn't belong in the same room as the others - she felt out of place.Very long, drawn out movie that was full of fillers and a cold cast. The film should have had more to it's plot. More action and much more feeling. Visuals are stunning, and adds to the MCU story. But boring to watch."
106,3,"The worst CBM of 2021 behind trash widow Eternals is one awful, awful movie, it presents you with so much but leaves you with so little, it tried to cram so many plot lines into an extremely long and lackluster film and didn't give any explanations.It had way too much going on and too many characters that I didn't care about, the plot makes no sense and the ending sucked, the vfx are astounding and the fight scenes are really entertaining but that's the best thing I can say about this mess of a movie.The acting is terrible, not for one moment did I believe any of them wanted to be there and were just there because they lost some bets.I'm gonna give Eternals a D."
107,1,"2.5 hours I will never get back Easily one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. So many talented cast and crew members came together and turned out a film that has little to no intellectual, creative or entertainment value whatsoever.Perhaps an alternative to continuing this concept in the cinematic form is to leave it on the comic book pages where it can thrive with fans who care."
108,4,"Eternals Eternals is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics race of the same name and produced by Marvel Studios 🌎Meh, it passed the time.Sort of. 😕IN THE BEGINNING..."
109,4,"Just very very boring Poah. They even come up with the question ""Where have the eternals been all this time?!"" and they answer it with ""They were not supposed to help humanity"". I am in shock. What kind of plot convenience is that supposed to be?! Stopping someone destroying half the universe is ""helping humanity""?! Weak, marvel, very very very weak. They can not logically hold their own universe together any more. Jack Kirby, the creator of the Eternals, never wanted them in the marvel comics, you can feel this with this movie as well.There are too much characters, too many stories to be told. The characters are flat, their motivation is not made clear. The only reason why they are doing what they are doing is because a red iron golem told them to. The conflicts between the eternals are boring because the characters are, the great threat never seems threatening. The visuals how ever a great, I like the camera work and the CGI is good, not as bad as it has been in other marvel movies.All in all, this movie is just senseless and boring and I as a viewer do not care about what is happening.And this indian with the camera... I never hated a character so much."
110,5,"SOMEWHAT AN ENTERTAINING FILM WITH DECENT AMOUNT OF THRILL AND EXHILARATION, BUT LACKS SUBSTANCE. Eternals is one of the biggest releases of Marvel this year and it's been in theatres for a while.The movie is somewhat a watchable flick which do have certain amount of content which gives the viewer goosebumps and thrill. With pretty good VFX being an advantage to the movie the film succeeds technically too. Where the film goes down is in the unnecessary comedy scenes and dialogues which may give the viewer a slight feeling of sleep coming to him and saying ""hey, buddy what bout taking a nap for a while?"". And its a problem which Marvel has for the past couple of years, adding comedy can be pretty good sometimes but Marvel movies usually never succeeds in doing that, because the jokes which they add are actually a waste of time. And also it destroys the superhero-vibe of the film. In this film it was the first half which had a lot of unnecessary jokes which ended becoming a factor for creating some snores. But the second half of the film was pretty enjoyable and thrilling. It was well directed and the cinematography also looked beautiful. Another drawback was in the writing, some characters were poorly written which made them just a piece of cringe.Overall, a watchable flick."
111,8,"GOT? Robb died and Jon is about to go fight the bad guys with a sword, It's like GOT all over again, only now Cersei doesn't drink that much wine.Anyway, I don't think I'll ever survive Gilgamesh's death."
112,8,"I think it is a fine new direction. Eternals are not bad. The fight scenes are great and creative, and the movie has some interesting idea. This is a new direction from Avengers, but I liked it."
113,2,"Lacking story line Tried to get thru the first 40 minutes, and couldn't get much farther. No real story except trying to go back and forth in time to show who the characters are. Very week story and directing. Waste of money if you spent it."
114,3,"Walmart Avengers It boggles my mind that the high reviews are insulting the low reviews. I saw one claiming that someone rating a movie low but watching the movie more than once is 'ridiculous'. Have you never watched a film critic before? We watch movies, even movies we don't like, over and over again to make our review accurate. To those high reviewers, I'm glad you liked the film. Maybe loved it. I respect your opinion on the manner, and I hope you respect mine. Moving into the specifics of the film, this story is a mess of pacing and characters. I specialize in character writing, and if my professor could tell you how to NOT write a character, she would point me to this movie.The protagonist has the same amount of personality as I did in middle school, and that's being generous. She wishes to save humanity for the sole purpose of being good I guess. She's a passive character in her own story, and that's without even mentioning her lackluster chemistry with the deuteragonist, Ikaris. But hey, still a better love story than Twilight.Speaking of, the deuteragonist in this story couldn't be more on the nose with the name. Ikaris, we get it, it's a reference. Haha look we're writing characters well, aren't we? We're gonna put lines about references to his name that is also a reference in the movie because we're clever. That totally won't get annoying and repetitive.It's honestly sad how the most interesting characters are sidelined. Phastos had an interesting past with humans and a really nice scene I won't spoil that gave him a reason to NOT want to save the world. But all of that is forgotten in five seconds and we don't explore that at all. I would've much preferred to see him learning to trust again and falling in love with the humans who betrayed him rather than it just... skipping.The cinematography is fine, but cinematography isn't just how 'pretty' a film is, it's about how the camera tells the story. It wasn't anything overly impressive to me.The action scenes were a snooze fest and was generic Marvel. I actually really like Marvel, but these scenes were just... no.The music was nothing special. I can't remember a single track that played and I watched the film yesterday.As for the ending, I think it's just stupid sequel setup that was unnecessary. Again, will not spoil, but I really LOVE the way they just wasted Kit Harington's character. Loooove ittttt. I have to wait another movie to see him in action, huh?(obviously sarcasm)This movie isn't worth anything over a 5/10. I don't particularly see how anyone could have a movie of this length with such atrocious pacing as even a guilty pleasure, but I'm not about to bash their opinions either. I'm glad if you liked the film, but personally, this disappointed me greatly. I literally only went to see the film because Jimin and Taehyung's song was in it. 3/10.Pros:Cons:(Now watch they all scream at me saying I'm just being homophobic because there's lgbtq+ representation in this movie... but here's a plot twist guys... I'm female and half-gay...)"
115,4,"Eternals A lot of hype coming into the film with Chloe Zhao at the helm and an exciting cast. Unfortunately, perhaps Eternals strayed a little too far from a typical Marvel experience, it got stuck in the limbo of being a serious arthouse film and ... well a Marvel film. No question that the latest CGI and various forms of technology was used to make this an eye candy, but the movie suffered by its slow pace, boring creatures and absolutely horrendous dialogues."
116,3,"I knew the film was in trouble when ... The words ""In the beginning"" scrolled up the screen.This film breaks the cardinal rule of cinema which is SHOW don't TELL.Diverse but uninteresting cast. Expository, sleep-inducing dialogue. Monologuing. I could not for the life of me muster an ounce of fks to give about anyone.I'm low key angry that they had such a diverse cast and failed to give any of them a personality. Maybe it was the direction, but the dialogue is also written so that they all speak with the same voice, with the same wooden delivery. Like the scriptwriter was talking to herself all in her head and couldn't hear how stupid the lines would sound if they were actually spoken.Just - the worst movie to come out of Marvel studios but to be fair the bar is set pretty high.If there happens to be a sequel I'll tune in for the first 20 minutes but if it isn't any better than this, I'm out."
117,2,Waste of talented actors With so many recognizable and famous actors and actresses I had high hopes. I found myself disappointed and bored. Everything was pretty predictable. Other marvel movies have always added to each other. This one felt way out of place and unnecessary.
118,8,"Give it a chance but lower your expectations. Here's The 4K Lowedown on ""Eternals"" (PG-13 - 2021 - 4K)Genre: Fantasy/Comic My Score: 7.64K: 7.6 HDR=7 Audio=8Cast=10 Acting=7 Plot=7 Ending=9 Story=5 Imagine=8 Pace=6 F/X=10 Comic=8 Funny=6The saga of the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who lived on Earth and shaped its history and civilizations.""If this is what the end of the world looks like, at least we'll have front-row seats."" This was definitely not my favorite but it wasn't my least favorite offering from Marvel Studios. While I think the movie holds its own weight, they should have led in to this one with some previous MCU films to throw some shine its way. Why the MCU isn't following the same model now is beyond me. This is a solid watch I think if everyone would give it a chance and lower their expectations."
119,10,"Don't pay the majority of viewers any mind. This was a great movie, with a great cast. The acting was really good, and the storyline and special effects were awesome! I happen to have great taste in movies. I'm very eclectic, but cannot do any movie that has a poor script, or is poorly acted. This was neither! Awesome job!"
120,1,"Worst story line The movie story is insult every religion. This is not fear, before i watch it. I thought it much better then loki, but after i watched that i'm very disappointed. We don't expect this types of movies by marvel."
121,1,"Boring mess with terrible writing and acting One of the most boring movies of all time. All the actors mail it in, and it drags on and on.Can't believe the producers didn't do any market research on the concept or the storyline before wasting so much money."
122,8,"""I love you Sersi, I don't care what you are"" You know you're in for a different Marvel movie when it comes with world building pre text exposition. I wonder if this would have been a better movie if it was in a stand alone universe. Has marvel dug themselves a decade long and 20 billion dollar hole by not allowing movies to exist in different universes. You'd think with all the multiverses this could have been placed in a world without Thanos and all the Avengers. Anyway, that aside, I really enjoyed the change in pace."
123,7,"Still not sure if I liked it or not After watching this movie I am still not sure if I liked it or not. It was something different than all the other marvel movies, but it does not mean that it was different in a bad way. The plot could had been written a little bit better, because there were a few scenes that could had been better. I did not expect such scene after the credits, I would have to say that it surprised me."
124,9,Loved this spectacular eye candy I've always liked Gemma Chan and here they gave her first billing. I didn't get bored and paid more attention to the acting which was very good. Loved the way the Marvel signature opened with Pink Floyd. That made my day. That's the era I'm from. But also I like creature features. My sci fi preference has that. With the Eternals created for the sole purpose of destroying the Deviants met my requirement for fun. In the actors' dialogue you get a personal feel for the flick and the characters. And you can tell early on how Sprite had a real liking for Ikaris so it doesn't surprise you later when she leaves with him. One of my favorite visuals is when Searcy does a Metamorpho on the bus. Now that's cool.
125,1,"Worst acting of all MCU films, dull story, empty characters. I skipped 30 min in the first 1h and were still able to catch up. The acting is so poor I find myself sigh almost every five lines. What went wrong? This should have never been made into a film."
126,5,"I don't know how to feel I am a huge Marvel fan and have been accused in the past of liking anything with the name Marvel on it. This movie was.... I don't know. The effects were stunning, but that is pretty much the only thing it has going for it. If you have an ensemble cast, you have to balance the characters well! Thena, for example, I thought was really cool, but we didn't have time to explore what she was going through. I really didn't like the exposition. As soon as a problem arose, we were given the answer! It also worked on waaay to grand a scale. At some points, I was totally on the Celestials side! I would die to save the lives of billions before me! And the ending was weird, too. After all that they just... turned the Celestial into ice? It was an extremely frustrating movie, and I really hope it doesn't drastically affect the MCU because it was annoying."
127,8,"New Gods Delivers good and eye-catching visuals, especially in shots involving sunlight. 10 characters are well presented but lacking in character story development. The LGBT scene in my opinion interferes with the flow of the film, even though it relates to the current situation. Interesting and unique costume design."
128,4,"Meh. Chloe, Kit and Angelina are spectacular...But Richard is very dour and the storyline is incohesive. Oscar winner Zhao didn't deserve those 2 Academy Awards IMHO. Very sketchy. And Salma Hayek? Old and atrocious! It's like Desperado and Frida didn't even exist! Who gave her scting lessons? JLo? THE indian actor and the supposed child were horrendous! I kept eyeing the exists hoping for a sign! The godawful length? Outrageous! KEVIN AND MARVEL DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MESS! No Way Home was better than this tripe and Sheng Chi was Gone With the Wind in comparison! THE EVAN HANSEN OF MARVEL FILMS! YUCK!!,"
129,4,Boring... I just watched this sluggish cinematic débâcle on Disney+. I'm just glad I didn't waste any money on it at a theatre. I'd rather watch paint dry than this movie again.
130,8,"So much money, so little entertainment A long and dull, heavy-handed cartoon. Ridiclously poor special effects. The actors were good, with some exceptions--but this was scarcely coherent. At least they have characters explain in two sentences whatever went on for ten minutes in the scene before. That's so if you wake up, you don't miss anything. But the best way to kiss nothing is to skip this preponderance of trash."
131,8,"Reset Your Expectations Marvel was always going to have to start making different movies if it was to thrive long term, and Eternals is the first effort in that direction.The dichotomy here is that while Eternals is a bigger story it is also more human. While it span the entirety of human civilisation it's more about the dynamics of family intersecting with duty. It is this that gives the story its dramatic tension, asking the question ""When you have to choose, where do your loyalties lie?""If you want non-stop action this movie is not for you. If you want a deeper and more meaningful outing then Eternals may be the one."
132,2,"Very weak premise and none of the characters are likable The acting is horrible and the story very weak. These characters are supposed to be immortal and all powerful, and alive for thousands of years yet they all act like spoiled little children. Save yourself the time and watch something else."
133,2,"Dont bother Long story short, its not a very good movie.The only good thing I can say is that (most of) the CGI is Marvel standard and that the music score is fairly decent. But thats about all the positive things I can.A lot of things just dont add up. I kinda had the same feeling after seeing this, as like after I watched Justice League, too much happens and too many characters needs to be introduced in a short periode of time, that they all loose meaning. The script is messy and flawed, the acting is stale, the woke-ness is just so blatant and without any real reason why it needs to be there that it just ruins the experiance (and we sadly knew that, when they used it as a PR stunt before the release).All in all, just skip this entry of the MCU. You gain nothing from watching it besides wasting 2h and 37min."
134,1,Absolutely rubbish This is one of the most stupid movie ever created on since deviants appeared on earth. The plot does not make any sense and the execution is very poor.
135,1,Poor movie Fully time waste movie .. Is this Marvel studios movie 🤔What a boaring movie. Better u bring Avengers series. Pls don't do eternal next part. Fully waste of time.
136,8,"Underrated May not have been the best storytelling in MCU but the amount of details and cinematography redeems the movie for me, especially after watching the Making of Eternals."
137,8,"Not as bad as people say ""Eternals"" get a bad wrap because it's artsier than most Marvel films, but it is honestly not nearly as bad as some people say.The script has some problems, sure, but the cinematography, acting and ambition of the film are all more than commendable."
138,5,"Too much It was good and got better when added multiverse. But making earth a egg and giving good actors a bad role, and mailing pointless characters, is to bad."
139,1,Eternally Boring I've been waiting a long time for this film and now I'm eternally disappointed. The Eternals have been on earth for 7000 years and that's exactly how long it seems like it takes for this movie to finish. The storyline is boring with no real direction. I used to think Ironman 3 was the worst movie in the MCU but Ironman 3 is the best movie in cinema history compared to the Eternals! Hopefully they won't waste their time making an Eternals 2.
140,7,"A very phase 1 style MCU film. Eternals isn't a bad movie. It also isn't amazing. It tells a story that is kind of late to the party at this point in the MCU, so it seems like a misstep of sorts, but it does have some cool action moments and it looks great. This film could have never been made and it would effect the MCU zero, so I'm that way there's zero risk to watching it."
141,8,"Too Cramped First of all, great visuals. I always enjoys movies with great visuals. The fighting scenes were satisfying, although it can be improved if they put more Thena in it. I think the weakness of this movie is that there wasn't enough time for them to introduce that many characters to the audience, to make them relatable or raise any sympathy. Like when Ajak died, does the audience care? Nope. Like, who is she? Why should we mourn her death? I think this movie should have been a series like WandaVision. Two hours isn't enough to bring this movie to justice. But over all, I still think that this movie isn't bad at all. Definitely better than Black Widow."
142,2,"Terrible This movie was terrible. Soooo long and I really wanted to turn off but I waiting for something to happen. Spoiler.... Nothing happens. Long, draggy, conversations that went on forever with no wowing moments. I get it's to develop the plot but it's like they were writing nothing about nothing. I wasn't into any of the characters, I don't even see a story line.. there's nothing captivating about it. I hope there isn't a sequel but I'm assuming they'll run with it."
143,1,"Worst garbage of 2021 5 minutes Is that all It takes to realise what garbage I'm watching. The superhero movies massproduced cheap garbage and streaming obssession has not only destroyed quality and artistic cinema.It has become hollow and desperate.Bad cgi effects, cringeworthy costumes not given a second thought In design. The monsters are also terrible designed. Watching eternals Is like watching a cheap fantasy sitcom like enchanted or the recently flopped cursed. To be honest I can't endorce crap like this. So I did not watch It through. There's not a second of real movie making In eternals.A bunch of grown b actors waving their hands and play pretend In silly costumes. There's no realism, excitment or joy to be found here."
144,1,"An ""eternal"" flop What happens when Marvel, I mean Disney, tries to create a new religion with bland acting, poor writing, plenty of immorality, and a vain attempt at a romance line? You get Eternals."
145,1,Total waste! Specially here to tell that there was no need for this movie It's not relevant Its not connecting to the storyline Advice-Just think before making such movies!
146,10,"A different movie There are a lot of negative reviews that don't represent the quality of this movie. It was a different movie from the other movies in the MCU and I truly believe it is a beautiful movie in its own way. It presented a very interesting addition to the MCU and just because the movie is a little slow paced, I don't think it deserves the negative reviews. Sci-fi fans will appreciate this movie."
147,2,Bad movie The only movie worse than this was the Fantastic Four reboot with Kate Mara. I actually walked out on that one. This dreadful creation just didn't live up to the hype.Poor writing and surprisingly bad acting. I guess even professionals have trouble overcoming the material.Damon Scott.
148,2,"Poorly written movie, didn't feel like marvel Story wasn't that good, anyone could tell that Ikaris was the killer after 30 mins of the movie. The good characters were like nerfed af. Thena went mad and was attacking friends but wasn't attacking the deviants in her mad state, wtf!.. Kingo was one the main character he got scared and ran away, should have at least returned in the end and helped a little buy was never shown again after he was gone."
149,1,caution....bordom may kill you Another garbage from marvel...as most if their movies....at least dc doesn't release 10 movies per year...here we have a poor story with mostly bad actors and boring exposition dialogues...the action is surely not enough....the monsters' design was pretty cool but that's it.... everything else mediocre to bad.
150,5,"Lukewarm at Best Let's start with the good, which is the CGI and action sequences. It's a Marvel movie, so there was never any need to be worried in that department. Now, it's not the best ever that they've made, but it's up to par, with eye-catching effects, vibrant environments and impressive fights.Unfortunately that's about the only good thing about this movie.The plot is very mediocre at best, and while I don't expect anything gripping and moving, this one is particularly hard to like. The main issue with it is that there are WAY too many things happening and so many subplots that it's too much to fit in a 2hr 30min movie and it all becomes very half-baked. Personally, it would have been much better to build up the characters with their own movies first before a movie with all of them together. The general audience, including me, knows too little about any of the characters to empathize with any of their plights.The acting wasn't anything amazing, either. From a star-studded cast like this, I'd have expected to be blown away, but this was more like a whisper. It's all too wooden and seems forced in a lot of areas. Because of this it's even harder to connect with the movie which was already hard enough given the subpar plot.For a movie of this scale, from Marvel, with all this star power, I'd have expected something truly stunning and amazing, and I was so excited to finally see this movie. If you're a casual moviegoer and not an avid Marvel fan, just skip this movie, you won't regret it."
151,8,"Much, much better than the reviews would have you believe I loved the scope of this movie - it's true that it has some issues with unrealised potential, but it's still a fantastic film that opens new doors for the MCU, and poses some very interesting questions. A must watch for MCU fans. Don't listen to the haters. This is easily a 7.5 out of 10."
152,4,"Doesn't need to exist. This movie was way too long and boring. It felt like most of the actors were just there because they wanted to be in a Marvel movie. The movie tries too hard to be inclusive instead of having a solid plot and just being a normal movie. Superhero movies shouldn't have to touch into gender and sexual orientation politics. It was also directed by an indie filmmaker with no experience and the screenplay was poorly written. My advice, just skip this one."
153,8,it's actually kinda good haha I really think that this movie could've been trash but they did a good job at balancing the characters and giving them their own time to shinethe thing that really saved this movie was the stunning shots by the director! I was stunnedthe choreography also was some of the most dope of the mcu and they had some really really cool fight scenes that i was actually by watching them!Semi spoiler- little upset that they had to kill off SOME of the characters that were huge in the promotion of the movieexcited to see more Makkari and druig and ummmmm *boy band members*
154,1,"Yikes what a snooze I am very easy to please when it comes to movies and I never write reviews... but after seeing reviews here and watching it myself because ""don't be fooled by the negative comments"" and then wasted time on this I just had to write something.... It's really funny how ppl actually wrote good things about this movie, where u all on drugs?It was a pain to watch. Nothing that keeps you interested and alert for what's to come. I realized after 1hour that I couldn't keep myself from opening my phone cus I was so bored. 1 and a half hour in and I just couldn't watch anymore...Don't waste your time on this."
155,1,"Worst superhero movie of the century. Long, boring, dreary, silly costumes, horrible CGI. All the relationships in the movie was about representation and diversity. WHERE'S THE STORY?I seriously just watched the movie and i know what color and sex the characters were but i don't know their names and superpowers."
156,9,"Spoilers Warning I don't understand all the hate, plot holes were explained but people didn't pay attention, the characters are essentially robots so it's understandable if the characters are flat but you sense them becoming more human like by showing emotions, falling in love. This storyline is exciting and I would want to see more of it, I was interested all of the way and the fight scenes were epic. People need to stop looking at it like the other marvel movies, they were all developed over time, you can't just watch endgame and feel the same as you did if you didn't watch all the iron-man and captain America etc movies. Give it time, wait for the next movie, let it develop, this isn't a single movie, this was you connecting with the characters, no wait for the next movie where the storyline goes on."
157,4,"Could have been better... There is a little spoiler in here, not that it matters as the movie is a disappoinment..So I just saw this movie.. brief summary is that Rob Stark didn't like John Snow and they fought over a girl. Rob lost so as a sore loser as he was, he committed suicide in the FREAKING SUN while Kumail Nanjiani tried to make fun of the whole situation. Lastly, #angelinajolie you still hot, babe."
158,3,"So bored at the 1 hour 40 minute mark I went to bed. I could not fathom enduring another 50+ minutes of this movies politically motivated leftist plugs.And then there is the story...For a franchise so large, why would they choose bottom of the barrel writers? What happened to true talent? Please, take chances with movies again and give us something we can watch for years to come, not something we want to forget we were ever forced to endure."
159,5,"Too big of a plot for a movie introducing this many new characters It took a whole hour before I even understood the point of this movie. The audience should have been let in on the big picture much sooner.There were a ton of new characters introduced. Despite the backstory of these characters feeling like it absolutely DRAGGED on, I still didn't feel emotionally connected to any of them. It's unfortunate because the Eternals as a concept fascinated me and their history opened a lot of interesting questions for the Marvel universe.They got thrown into too much too soon. They deserved a better introduction. The movie ended and I still don't care about any of the characters like I did after every other MCU character's intro movie. With this movie I see a lot of potential for the Marvel universe as a whole, but the cool plot potential came at the expense of a chance for the audience to connect with these characters. It's really a shame."
160,4,"No flow just slow It took 10 years plus of movies for all the infinity war characters to come together in one movie with amazing story arcs complementing each other. The Eternals tried to give the origin story of 9 characters in one eternally long movie. You are jumping from story line to story line with no flow whatsoever. When you think you're getting somewhere in a characters arc, BOOM, you thought wrong."
161,6,"Disappointing I really, really, really, wanted to love this but even I, an avid MCU fan, couldn't. An amazing cast couldn't bring this drab, slow and quite unnecessarily long film to life. As you would expect from the MCU it had some great CGI and special FX but it was sadly let down by a dull storyline. Hopefully there are no plans for a sequel."
162,1,"Just another disgusting attempt by Kaz Firpo to victimize Japan. It is not only ridiculous that in the story, a black character is burdened with the feeling of guilt for the invention of the destructive weapon, but also vicious that Kaz Firpo shifts the emphasis of the incidents to how Japan suffered from the nuke, rather than how the nation was poisoned by the fanatic ideologies similar to Nazis.Overall, while this show attempt to infuse the origin and the lore of the Eternals into how they interact with human history, it gets sloppier only after a few episodes. Victimization of Perpetrators: Japanese War Crimes."
163,10,"Brilliant idea yet difficult connect. Still worth watching asnthe concept of Eternals is beautiful and literally out of this world Bit hqrd to connect due to being very misunderstood title because of not knowing the characters (meaning hard to connect!!) as well as the ones from Avengers whom Marvel have been building stories for movies before the joint superhero movie whe you can only feel the connection between the characters that have to put such a single performences when we could focuse only on getting to know that certain character. Brilliant Kirby for writing the Eternals, I have not know the story might be superb like that, not read the comics unfortunately."
164,5,"Lacks elements that made other MCU films special After the events of 'Avengers: Endgame,' it was hard to know which direction Marvel would take in its cinematic universe given the film was the culmination of more than 30 films released over the course of a decade. We got glimpses of some chapters, from 'Black Widow' to 'Shang Chi,' but 'Eternals' felt like the next big event in the MCU.Unfortunately, while the film is technically impressive, it lacks the character and personality of many of those that preceded it. Sure, there's ample starpower, from A-listers Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek to fresh faces like Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but in bringing everyone together the chemistry was not even close to being on par with the Avengers crew - nevermind those from 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' There was also the lack of a real intimidating villain, and the ""twist"" was seen from a mile away. Add all of this up and you get a pretty wooden, linear superhero film that doesn't light a fire the way others did. Oh, and the runtime...seriously?There's no denying Chloe Zhao is a talented director, but her decision to helm 'Eternals' may not have been the highlight of her career."
165,1,Really thought this was the Eternals as it went on forever Possibly the worst film I've watched in 2022 and I've seen a few stinkers. This hand down is definitely the worst Superhero film of all without dispute. What a waste of talent and money on this film. Truly awful.
166,1,So bad It's really disappointing. It's not like marvel movies.Great actors but bad acting. When I saw the trailer I had a big expectations but when I saw the movie it's so bad.
167,2,Worst marvel movie Very bad movie. Nothing to marvel stadard. Story build was fine but end scene was worst. Missing Stanley touch. Too melodramatic movie. Thing ends suddenly with a prety expected end. Never expected such a weird show from marvel.
168,9,"Great! Such a different concept for a Marvel production nowadays! I think those actors actually interpretated the characters really well, loved the twists, 9/10!"
169,3,"Bored I was expecting a Marvel movie that, is entertaining pleasant to watch, and instead, it was a political statement about diversity, non-binary and lgbt, none of the characters fit their role, they were bored, their superpower lacked imagination."
170,3,"Boring Just dull, then it goes to boring, slides slowly into more boring, then it plods into guess what? More boring and at 1:26 min I gave up. Doubt that I'll even bother coming back to finish it.Not a super hero movie."
171,2,"Made it to 63 minute mark. My wife who is more of a fan of the recent superhero films than I am said ""this is not good"" at the 7 minute mark. The plot and obvious CGI monster battles were boring. I started into my phone for something to entertain me at the 40 minute mark. Found my wife also drifted off to her phone at 63 minute mark and finally turned the TV off. I think I only gave it a 2 because Salma? This movie is a waste of electricity. If other people made it further, more power to them. They are legend."
172,4,"A Mediocre Marvel movie I love every Marvel movies probably starting with Thor and Iron Man. After Guardians of the Galaxy, they jumped to another level. Stories, characters, character developments have been very good. However, I can't say the same thing for Eternals. The story is original, actors/actresses are mostly well-known, the movie is Marvel-branded, the story sounds promising, visual effects are very good but I couldn't like the movie. First, Selma Hayek doesn't fit to a ""wise"" character, thanks to her earlier roles. Angelina Jolie (Thena) could bring an impressive influence to the movie. I don't know why the director weakened her character. Other stupid decisions of the director: too many unrelated emotional scenes, meaningless anger and rapid changes of decisions of the eternals, not-so-funny jokes, unnecessary Karun, and too much meaningless talks... I couldn't like any character and I really couldn't connect to them. Eternals are supposed to be superheroes but none of them is a superhero: Ikarus acts like a villain and others are just doing SOMETHING..! The movie is 2 hours 36 minutes. If this movie was made like other Marvel movies, this story could be fit to 40 mins. Sounds like a sci-fi soap opera? Marvel, please keep your standards high! 'Old Guard' has a similar plot and it did a much better job! Eternals must be the lowest-quality Marvel movie of all time."
173,7,"A good waste of time Stunning visuals, a seat-gripping epic serving as a suitable backdrop to the familiar escapist extravaganza from years prior. I don't mind leaving the comfy womb of the Avengers for a bit."
174,10,"Spectacular I don't always trust the bad reviews, and this movie is exactly why!I m not a marvel fan or in general a fan of superheroe movies ( haven't even watched all the avengers etc) but this sci fi is sooo good.The acting is great, which is no wonder cause the cast is amazing, the story is very interesting and the special effects are beyond spectacular.Can't wait for part 2 !"
175,4,"Not my favorite MCU movie I kept sitting there expecting it to pick up after thirty minutes... But it didn't... Then I expected it to pick up after 60, 90 minutes. The movie really didn't get going at all really. The characters are very similar in their apparent insecurities. Disappointing MCU movie. . You can see it's set up for a sequel by the sheet credits. So here's hoping it does better. But I will be waiting till it's steaming. Won't go to the theater for it."
176,5,Marvels first missed step since Thor:The Dark World With a Stella cast & directors you'd think this would be a certainty to be another smash Marvel blockbuster but instead it's a untidy mess with no real salvageable parts to even try to pull it together Luckily the new Spider-Man movie makes up for this lack lustre bore.
177,7,"Fine while it lasted I've seen people both praising and hating on this film. Although some parts may be lacking I still think that Eternals is a pretty decent film. Althoug it didn't leave as big of an impact as maybe Endgame or even the first Iron Man did, It was a nice movie with some occasionally funny moments (mostly coming from Karun) and some interesting themes. I also thought that the run time was fine although some insist on criticizing that part.Some characters like Kro could probably could have gotten a little more screen-time.Let's just say that it was enjoyable while watching but a little forgettable in the grand scheme of things."
178,2,"Difficult to review. It's not up the standard of other MCU movies and feels like it would be more at home in the DC universe, for more than just a couple of reasons.Lacking character development, you simply don't get a sense of the vast lifespans and scope of the story.It's difficult the reconcile with the established MCU narrative. Though the Shrek cameo is entertaining... 😜"
179,1,"Could be better with different actors The movie is cool great visuals and i appluad the design team, but the story is not that great and could be much much better with different characters.Some are great like ikaris, sprite, ajak, kingo, cersi, and gilgamesh, but the others gotta go, like they are terrible, bad actors, only chosen because they are ""special"" and in their case not good at all.The story and the characters don't fit at all, you got eternal beings with many issues in their characters, like it makes no sense, it had so much potential.As an engineer, I feel bad for the engineers working on this movie, they are so talented but the writers are terrible and marvel's new religion is disgusting."
180,2,Terrible movie I rented it on prime and it was a waste of $5.99. I tried to get through the first hour but couldn't do it. How did this ever get released and actually make money?
181,5,"Yawntastic If only the story had been a little more... Story.This movie didn't make us care about any of the characters. Jon Snow was in the first ten mins and then... where?The best personality's died. And after that... Meh.You need more than ""Marvel"" in the production ppl & an amageddon scenario.Yaaaaaaawn."
182,2,"Repeating base of story. Now most of the people is bored with superhero movies, it looks like movie makers were very desperate for earning money and they made this. If they have made this movie on human hero, then may be it can be a interesting movie."
183,10,What a massterpiece Eternals was a hash movie. A very weak mcu installment. I thought this movie would have been unique. It was it was uniquely hash. I didn't care about any of the characters or even lousy story.MCU struck out in 2021. Maybe Dr. Strange can end the streak.Don't watch this hash.
184,2,"Boring and forgettable Usually I'm a big fan of the Mcu. I like every single Mcu movie with one or two exceptions, so I was really hyped for this one. It looked like a total new concept for this franchise and I kinda think that's what the Mcu needs right now. I mean Wandavision was really great with this whole sitcom concept and stuff. So were Loki and Hawkeye, but Eternals was just a boring and way too long movie with absolutely forgettable characters and some really unfunny and partly awkward gags.I mean they really want us to believe that Sprite, who lived thousands of years on the earth, still acts like a teenager, who falls in love with a extremist, who wants to kill the human race? Every other Character is also not interesting! They tried to give Thena some kind of tragic backstory, but that didn't fit very good as well.The movie results in a classical Marvel final battle with medium CGI and absolutely no depth. Ikaris kills himself and we should be sad I guess?This movie has also way too much and badly placed flashbacks that just interrupt the flow of the movie, but I think the main problem is still its way too many characters that they try to introduce.All in all the WORST Mcu movie and that's sad, because its concept was so interesting."
185,6,"Disappointing I don't know what they were thinking with this movie, the script seems to secondary to trying to just get cool scenary and background shots. Some of the lines delivered by actors are cringeworthy. Icarus actor stone faced throughout the movie, this is not the marvel I know lol. Very disjointed and random context scenes that really weren't needed and dragged out the runtime and messed with the pacing."
186,1,"Boring and forgettable It's called the enterals because it's very boring and goes on for what feels like an eternity. Marvel is known for taking liberties of its source material but this one, takes basically everything from its source material and throws it in the trash. Instead of trying to make a movie that fans will love, a faithful adaptation of a piece of work by one of the greats, they set out to make the most diverse and boring piece of fan fiction. Of course it all boils down to the straight white male being the bad guy again, and the strong girl boss POC being the bestest ever. They took the most recognizable enteral and turned him into a short evil guy for no reason other than you can't have a straight white man be one of the strongest characters in the MCU. Putting that aside the storyline has more holes in it than deadpool after a shoot out. Their reasoning for not interfering in the snap was that it wasn't connected to the deviants, even though thanos is an eternal with the deviant virus in him, and by him snapping the planet he stopped the progression of the emergence. Also why didn't the enternals try to stop EGO when he wanted to destroy all life? That would've stopped the birth of future Celestials? It's a useless DC knock off that even mentions Batman and Superman in it. They took a colorful series and turned into another generic dark syfy movie. The colors in this should have resembled and paid love to Kirby's style. Much like Thor 3 did. The movie is a mess, flipp flopping time periods, tracking down characters no one knows, that coupled with horrid cgi and bad writing. I recommend skipping this, because it has no implications on the MCU what so ever, nothing in this is mentioned in anything else that's come after. Which is weird because hands and half a head of a celestial are sticking out the earth."
187,6,"Good concept, bad execution Eternals had an important role for the MCU, by tasking expand the scale of phase 4 with a deeper look into the cosmic aspects of the Marvel Universe.It had the characters and plot needed to succeed at that task, but then they decided to utterly mess up the timing of it.The biggest issue with the movie, is that it currently sticks out like a sore thumb in the timeline of the MCU.The movie is desperately trying to fit in 11 characters worth of introduction (after all Black Knight is also introduced in this movie, even if he's not actually introduced) into a two and half hour movie that's supposed to take place in the past and the future of the MCU.Future you may ask? Yes, considering that the events of this movie takes place after everything that has been released up until now (this includes of the Loki series, Shang-Chi, Spiderman NWH, Hawkeye series to name just the recent ones).So on one side Marvel is still laying down the ground works for the new characters, as well as the Multiverse (which has a huge impact on the MCU as whole), and on the other side thew decided to throw in 1 movie about the Gods of the MCU (which has different huge impact on the scale of things).Their existence is also very poorly explained.This should have been a series and plan it when the more cosmic stories play a more prominent role in the MCU."
188,5,"Not Up to Marvel's Standards Words that I would use to describe this movie (especially in the wake of the epic Thanos arc, and the high-quality series Loki & WandaVision):Bland Uninspired ArduousThis movie is simply not up to the standards of Marvel's previous successes. I get that you can't hit a home run every time (the first two Thor movies proved that), but this was so uninteresting that I literally had trouble staying awake. I honestly hope that they don't even pursue this branch of the Marvel universe any further."
189,1,"Waste of Time! Don't bother. Boring, poorly acted, a waste of time! Kept falling asleep. If you have watched it already, don't bother!Not sure why they bothered to release it. If Marvel/Disney continues down this road, there won't be anything worth watching."
190,9,"Power rangers 😑 So i watched this movie yesterday and wanted to share my opinion. Let's start with some positive points :-The VFX used in the movie is so Amazing 😍. I love the visuals of their powers.Second, the resemblance with HISTORICAL EVENTS is interesting as i had history subject in my schooltime, so i can relate it.Third, despite of so many characters, the movie focus on CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT so neatly and each & every character is explained as expected from a origin movie.Fourth, the COMEDY part of the movie, for which marvel is famous.Fifth, different CULTURES are shown in the movie. But i am so much fascinated by the Indian culture bcz i am indian.Sixth, so many RESEMBLANCE with different things especially with gods like athena, Gilgamesh, ikaris etc., All these names are taken from ancient epics.Seventh, the POST CREDIT SCENES, the put me into a cliffhanger and created a surrounding of suspense.Last, there are some EASTER EGGS as well if you can find it.Now let's talk about some negative pointsFirst, REPETITIVE CONCEPT of saving the world which we seen so many times. That's why story becomes boring as we know at the end heroes will win.Second, some MISTAKES are there which are stuck in your mind while watching the movie.Third, the are some LAME explainations to the very big questions like why they don't interfere in endgame & why sprite and ikaris betray & why the celestial join the uni modeFourth, the SECOND HALF becomes so WEAK in context of story and character development and that thing is so annoying.Thats all from my side. 🤗"
191,2,"disappointment There are a lot of characters in this movie unnecessarily. The story is weak and the ending is trivial. I was waiting for a nice movie, but I was disappointed."
192,2,Worst MCU movie ever What has happened to marvel this was the worst movie made very slow story and long runtime no use of this movie in the MCU series.😏 Totally away from the main storyline of the MCU series very boring movie I stopped it after 45 mins because of getting to much bored please MCU do not ever make a seuql of it again.
193,2,"this film does not knwo what it wants I find it laughable to say that with a 200 million budget, a oscarwinning director, almost 3hurs running time and 8 A- list actors, it is a hard feat to intrduce a bunch of generic superheros into a superhero univers.Its a joke.So, we get hit over the head with boring CGI-monster fights, weird and uconvincign lovetriangles, confusing timejumps, very very very boring and usless dialogue and a bunch of confusing, mostly orgettable villlains.And at no point do we know what this film wants... are the eternals living in secret? Somehow one of them is the most famous tv star in a country with a billion people and does a documentary about them ... not to mention that they tend to tell stroies to the ancient babyloians with hight definition illusions and fireworks and also used to fight giant monsters.Are they sopposed to make humanity strive or are they just there to destroy the deviants and then go on standby?Are they meant to incurrage struggle and war to make humanity develop?At no point do i find a hint on what these ""heros"" are supposed to do but that one thing they finished within the first 10min of the movie.And after that i feel lost like the remaining plot."
194,6,Not as good as I thought it would have been. Great visual effects. Great actors all in there prime. I don't know what to say really so I'm not gonna say anything. If you don't have Disney plus please don't pay for it it's not worth it. The movie is not that good to be honest.
195,5,"Worst Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie This is the Worst Cast Choice for a Marvel Movie,as well as very Shallow Acting and Overall the Worst Marvel Movie,I have ever watched. The Dialogues were also Bad. This Movie Felt Awkward to Watch for Someone like me who is a Big Fan of Great MCU Movies like Ironman,Captain America,Thor,Avengers movies. The Great Vibe of MCU movie was Missing."
196,7,"I don't understand the hate Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I'm not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it."
197,6,"could have been better The movie had its good moments but it was kind of dull at times. Definitely liked Makkari and Gilgamesh the most. Comparing it to other MCU films though, it was severely lacking."
198,4,"Eternal bore Look I do not even have typing energy to spare so don't come here looking for a monologue. The movie is an 'Eternal' bore.Felt like a prequel entirely based solely on introducing who was, who is and who will be. I'm a diehard marvel fan but nah this ain't it.The jokes, character reveals and dialogue just felt off and cringy sometimes. Please save your 2 hours. Hope you find this helpful. If you don't well that's your problem."
199,6,"Eternals a 2006 Film released in 2021 Mind you this film is not bad but an average considering how far Marvel has come up. May be if this came out in 2006 we would have all appreciated it but this film failed under Marvel's own weight. It had no real villian, some dog like creatures as its side kick, Bunch of eternals with minor character development and fighting dogs for ages and an Oscar winning director who probably never understood what comic book craze is all about. All in all made sure everyone feels this is just unnecessary. Chloe zhao just forgot movie making is all about character development, motivated 3 dimensional villian and a mission unlike the other. Im giving it a six but probably it deserves a 5."
200,3,"Worst Marvel movie ever The storyline was poor, the acting not much better. CGI was done on the cheap.This was a fill in movie, just to add content to the streaming platforms library without investing to much (at least I hope that didn't cost much to make). This one isn't worth your time."
201,5,"Not Quite the Avengers Eternals so badly wants to mirror the success of the Avengers: ensemble cast, massive cinematic action sequences, dramatic music over the top of slow-motion scenes... but it's just not on that level. It rushes into it too quickly without giving us ample time to care about the characters (like we do the Avengers).The special effects are quite impressive and Angelina Jolie might be the most fluid fighting superhero I've ever seen, but it's not enough to push this film into greatness. There are only a few laughs to go around (more like chuckles), and the plot moves so quickly between locations and times that you feel like you've watched the SparkNotes version of an epic tale. Not to mention, I thought that Gemma Chan's character fell a bit flat for what was supposed to be the main protagonist role. Not sure if it was the writing or direction, but it never felt like she was given liberty to expand her range.It's worth a view, but temper expectations and think of the Eternals as the equivalent to when a sports franchise says it's in a ""rebuilding year.""Verdict: Watch."
202,3,"Not good This movie is not good. Even for a filler MCU movie. I think the main problems were pacing and editing. This probably would've been better served as 6, 30 minute episodes on Disney+. The plot was fairly wack, but 30 minutes a pop, with fast pacing and action, might've done it Justice."
203,4,"Eternals. A superheros movie must be entertaining. Well, this one is not.The story is bigger than being presented in a film.I didn't like the characters, their costume And some of the actors too.The bright side is the visual production, it's a ""Marvel"" thing."
204,6,Nothing particular interesting This drags on for way too long. There is no clear direction or objective. I didn't like any of the characters we were following either. Just a waste of resources and a star cast. There is not much action either so this sets it apart from all other MCU movies.Overall it's not as bad as claimed but not good either. I took one star away because of the past credits scene.
205,3,"An Awful Mess of a Movie that I Struggled to Finish Eternals had so much going for it. There's so much interesting potential with the story, but most of that is lost, if not thrown away, in favor of visuals and action. And even most of that either fell flat or didn't make sense.Conceptually, this could have been a game-changing installment in the MCU, and really build on and shift the mythos into something much deeper than we've seen thus far.This is also an impressive cast. Salma! Angelina! John Snow AND Rob Stark! Dude from Dunkirk! And the guy who plays Phastos, who I don't think I've seen before, was a standout. Strong set of talent going into it.Sadly, the story collapses under the weight of trying to juggle the characters of 10, yes TEN, heroes and 2 normal humans, one of whom we later find out is not actually normal at all, but yet another hero. Not to mention balancing all that while clearly prioritizing CGI-filled action sequences. More time is spent trying to introduce, explain, and explore all of the character's various powers than the characters themselves.Then there's the jumping around through time. Oh, we are shown prehistoric Mesopotamia, the Ishtar Gates and Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the aftermath of Hiroshima, even the fall of the Aztec Empire! But none of it serves any purpose other than something really cool to look at. Which is probably the sole redeeming quality of the film as a whole: The cinematography. This is definitely one of the best-shot MCU movies, with lots of stunning visuals and camerawork, right from the opening shots. Ironically, the CGI monsters and the celestials themselves actually look pretty terrible, like a video game. Maybe they should have prioritized those in their effects budget?And... about those Celestials. They've been built up for a while now. We've seen brief glimpses of them laying waste to worlds, and they've been spoken of in almost hushed tones, from the floating head of Knowhere to Ego in Guardians 2 revealing that he was one of them. It should have been a big moment to finally give them a full and proper reveal. I would have enjoyed continuing the tension-building around that throughout the movie. Maybe only speak of them and of Arishem in the past tense. Then, when he showed up it could have been a really dramatic demonstration of power. But, no. Arishem is there in speaking roles right from the beginning and they do some kind of VR facetime thing across space regularly throughout the film. By the time he shows up at the end, it lost all of its weight and impact.Everything the script tries to do to give any of them depth or personality feels trite, contrived, and shallow as a result. None of it ever amounts to anything meaningful, even when it tries to be impactful to the plot, nor could it be... because that would take time to develop those things and the film is already two and a half hours long. What they could have done is pruned. Maybe half as many characters. Maybe not try to flesh out the villain if they are only going to unceremoniously kill him off, especially if the characters themselves are questioning the purpose of their mission? I have no idea what this film was actually trying to do, because it was doing so very much.A horrible mess of jumbled, half-baked ideas. The first MCU installment I truly hated... reminding me of just how bad superhero movies used to be and can still be, if not careful. It's a shame I saw this right after Shang-Chi, which was one of the better MCU films so far in terms of characters, motivations, and emotional weight to it. I hope this is not a sign that the franchise is too big to keep up with consistency."
206,3,"Poor characterization and development, morality and goals defined are nonexistent and meaningless Alright firstly there are 10 main characters introduced with powers, the large cast makes it difficult to create effective development. Then throughout the movie they struggle to do the show not tell method, the expositional conflict is told to us not discovered. Plenty of things are told not shown to the love between Ikaris and Sersi to Sprite loving Ikaris. The role of Ajak, when she dies as a mentor character it effects the main characters but not us as veiwers. Because of how little she leads Ajak is a undeveloped character she doesn't show any outstanding leadership qualities nor does she disagree with anybody her few notable scenes are telling everybody to live their lives and talking to the big force Arishem. Which don't have much characterization other than she doesn't care what anybody does, which is noted when she allows Druig to leave with humans, when Thena keeps her memories, and does nothing to stop earth's destruction. I mean come on the celestials had no repercussions when doing it .I cannot relate to any of the characters and find it hard to care for their interests and wellbeing. Being immortal and living a perfect life with no hardship. Now in Thor, he had everything a good life, but what made his movie better was that he was prideful and fixed it throughout the movie here nobody realizes anything we can relate to. Their development is stagnant.Morality. Why do any of the characters care there is not one scene, in the beginning that expresses any of the 10 eternals caring for the humans, other than some of them participating in mundane normal tasks such as the dough rolling, the fireworks, etc. Actions speak louder than words the only character that sees that the killing is wrong is Druig, he stops the war and the fighting and doesn't let the humans kill each other. While he does this nobody fights Druig they just let him control people and make peace even though it is their ONE RULE nobody stops him. He is the one I can relate to and enjoy the most after I respect him and his choice. Others though he was right they are killers for ignoring the violence. Though his love of the human life is disputed quickly when in a later scene some of his people die while shooting the diviant. So his development went essentially backwards. Back to the topic, why do any of them care if humans die. Sersi loves Dane. Phastos loves his family. So they have an excuse for saving the planet, but again she and the other eternals never cared for saving humans before, even when the aliens came down which was mentioned. So why fight? They don't want to fight Arishem nor want to rebel from what it seems in the beginning; it's just odd.Why do all the side characters want the main character to go, perfect chance for conflict! But no the movie producer and Phastos lover both let him go without rebellion, that is very unnatural!!Ajak telling Ikaris the truth is also strange. She choose Sersi and knew Ikaris was faithful to Arishem so why tell him and not Sersi? That was a idiotic movie if she really was trying to save earth she needed to act like it no just stand around waiting.No repercussions from stopping the emerging, Ikaris suddenly letting his morals change his goals, sersi killing a celestial, then Ikaris killing himself. This is so inconsistent the main antagonist REJECTING HIS ENTIRE GOAL and helping the heros.Also mentioning Thena, It was stated that she remembered her past memories and went crazy and attacked her friends because of it, so this is saying that we have to replace our memories stay who we are. This is never addressed in the future, they all are eventually going to remember their past and want to kill each other. They never fix Thena and the fact that her past is making her go crazy kind of proves the enemy Arishem right as in order to survive memories need to be erased.Together the movie struggles with consistency and errors that cost this movie from the potential it could have reached. The production and effects are wonderful unlike the writing so enjoy that."
207,6,"Watchable but a bit of a let down At about 2 hours and 40 minutes long, Eternals achieves the rare feat of feeling both too long and too short. On one hand there are an awful lot of scenes that are little more then exposition to try and help us understand who the Eternals are, but on the other hand it feels like these scenes needed to be much more in depth in order to help flesh out the characters.Whilst watching the film I couldn't help but feel that Marvel should have either taken the approach that they did with Guardians of the Galaxy by watching the team develop in a more self contained story that gives each character a chance to grow. Either that or release this as a Disney + series where each character gets an episode where their development is the main focus. The storyline for this film is just too big for a new entry and would have served better for a sequel, especially given that these are z-lister comic book characters with no mainstream exposure and therefore a fully fleshed out origin is essential.That's not to say this is a bad film. It's still watchable with plenty entertaining action to make up for the parts that do drag and visually it's one of the best looking MCU films to date, but I was continually left with the feeling that there was a lot of wasted potential here."
208,4,Soulless movie So a problem with many Marvel movies plays a role here too. It seems like they have the basic storyline and create special effects around that. This movie lacks good engaching writing! Writers should have probably spend some time in Greece and the middle east to learn about acient culture but mostly learn about classical stories of mythology. This movies is hollow. Truly sad because this could have been of the level like Avatar combined with star wars.
209,2,"Horrible I really tried to enjoy it but it was probably one of the worst things I've seen in a while. Really disappointing, I don't recommend it at all. Don't waste your time on it."
210,6,"Decent This film is huge! There is so much going on in this film that it becomes overwhelming at times. But I guess that's fair to say since the Eternals have roamed Earth for seven thousand years. Even though the length of this film is pleasantly long, it still felt rushed at times where some scenes just did not make a lot of sense. There were also some moments where the CGI was very noticeable, which I guess could be expected since most of the film was filmed in natural outdoor environments. However, this film stands alone on it's own pedestal - it is completely different from any other Marvel film, which I quite enjoy! It's evident in the storytelling of this film that there was a lot of thought and passion. I absolutely love how the Eternals were derived and altered from characters of ancient mythology like Athena, Icarus, and Gilgamesh. I also loved the cast of this film! Each actor portrayed their characters beautifully! Watching how this film was made, and listening to Chloé Zhao explain her process of casting was intriguing - that not only was each actor able to connect and portray their own character, they were also able to demonstrate their own morals and personalities, too. There was only one actor/characters that I was not a fan of - Harry Styles as Eros did not work for me, I was just not feeling it with him like I was with the others. The Deviants were an interesting breed, or breeds I should say. I don't know how to feel about them. They did not feel as original to me, but they were cool, I guess. I do love the concept of the Celestials, and I hope that we get to see and learn more about them in the future. Overall, this film was beautiful, and I applaud everyone from Marvel Studios for creating such a massively diverse film. Especially Chloé Zhao, with her casting, her unique vision and passionate storytelling - it truly did create a beautiful and unique film."
211,1,I got it I made it to the half way point. It's the same story being rehashed again and again. Super beings sent to Earth for some mission to save humans. The idea is old and has become cliché-ish. I don't find anything interesting about it other than the special effects. The story is completely predictable. It is also inconsistent and the writers use a lot of Deus ex machina to move scenes along.I am tired of Marvel and DC movies. I used to be a super fan of Marvel. I only collected Spider-Man and Batman for DC. I found them more realistic and grounded. It is movies like this which ruined it for me. I think this is just another stab at using as many comics as possible to milk the cow before it dies.
212,3,"""The Eternals"" should be eternally forgotten So Marvel Studios does not always have the Midas touch, not everything they do turns to gold. This movie is pretty dreadful, and worse it is boring. ""The Eternals"" should be eternally forgotten."
213,2,"The Worst Marvel Movie, and I'm a fan.. I would like to state that I'm a big fan of both Marvel and DC, so I have no prejudice against this genre of Moves.That being said, this one was hard to watch, so hard in fact that I only got to the scene on the bridge where 2 eternal s that were romantically involved, meet up again after a few hundred years.4 other ppl started watching this movie with me, and I was the only one left by this point, 3 went to bed, and 1 went home.I found it hard to connect to the characters, the acting was a range between mediocre and god awful, the story was slow, predictable and sterile.I even found the costume design annoying.I think this is a movie that should only be played if you want to kill a party or shake off some house quests that have overstayed their welcome, pop this movie on and in 20 mins you will have your house back guaranteed."
214,4,"Disappointing In More Than One Way I expected and was prepared for the length of the movie but I found it confusing, inconsistent and disappointing. Visually it was good but I actually wanted to watch because of Salma Hayek. Unfortunately she wasn't on the screen enough in my opinion.I am not a fan of Angelina Jolie at all but I was disappointed in the amount of screen time for her as well.I did like a few of the characters but was mad that two of them were killed off. The ending didn't help its cause either.I won't be watching the sequel."
215,8,"Better than I thought... Few casting issues aside, a lot better than thought it would be. Story is actually quite good. Probably would have been better as a mini series than a movie..."
216,4,"Other movies to watch Watching this now, about 30 minites into it, don't know if I'm going to get to the end. There are other movies I want to see and this just isn't holding my interest. One question: On Disney+ why does the movie repeatedly switch back and forth from full screen to letterbox?"
217,4,"Empty, forced, to watch while doing something else. New characters, widely recycled (Superman and Flash on top) in a more diversity and inclusive way and put them in parrarel to the well loved old school Marvel story (Avengers).Such a forced and empty story, Marvel should take a few years of a break to get their ideas together but the business asks otherwise.Ah also, it's all getting so perfectly diverse that is so not believable."
218,3,"Portentous claptrap Slow, boring, grandiose, wooden cardboard characters, takes itself far too seriously. Difficult to find anything redeeming about it. I'm just glad I didn't buy it!"
219,5,"Eternally disappointing! When I saw the cast & knew it was a Marvel movie I was very excited to see this 2 hour 37 minutes movie, as the casting of the movie was very good.( this dreadful script & story could have been told in about 20 minutes ).However the script writer & director Chloé Zhao ( who is only partially responsible for this dull, laborious non substantial screenplay along with Kaz Firpo, Ryan Firpo & Patrick Burleigh ) made a total mess of this movie.Whomever was responsible for choosing her made a very poor choice as unfortunately she has proved this is not the type of movie she is good at.What a complete waste of talent ( I feel so bad for the actors in this film ).Though ultimately those famous actors did choose to take this high risk.( thank goodness other Marvel films such as Black Widow & Shang-Chi though only mediocre Marvel Movies = 7 out of 10 for both ) can keep the bad feeling of ""Eternals"" out of our minds & save the Marvel universe.Why this movie is 5 stars ( basically the actors make it bearable as yes as a Marvel fan you kind of have to watch this movie so you understand what is going on in the Marvel universe, just so you know you've not missed any of the important things. Ultimately you end up realising you've missed absolutely nothing of consequence but maybe in future films it will be relevant so if you have Disney+ you kind of have to watch this bad film ).Should this story of the Eternals end here ( absolutely ) as if you want to use the actors & characters in other Marvel films with a competent director & screenplay writers then fine, but Chloé Zhao has killed Eternals 2 we hope.( there is no coming back for this movie as it doesn't make real sense ).Normally I give my personal opinion & reasons on why a film loses stars & brings it down to a 9,8,7 or 6 etc, however this script is so bad & the whole directing of it so ridiculous ( for a big budget Marvel universe film ) instead I'll try to list the positives of the movie that drag it up to the 5 out of 10.So it earns 1 star quite rightly because the visual effects are top notch.( the visual effects team can be proud of the quality hard work put in ).It earns a 2nd star because the character Ikaris was well acted by Richard Madden as he is a very good actor & proved his talent in this dire movie.( he was good in Game of Thrones so good to see him really commit ).It's 3rd star was earned surprisingly not for Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie or Salam Hayek ( who all underwhelmed with their scripts given to them even though in other films they have been fantastic ), but it was earned by the very talented Ma Dong-seok aka Don Lee who played Gilgamesh as he was very good in this & also committed himself 100% to his characterisation.It's 4th star though hardly in it was the actor Kit Harington who plays the peripheral character Dane Whitman ( who has a secret that we want to learn about in a completely separate moving please away from this Director ).Kit Harington was ""Jon Snow"" in Game of Thrones & is captivating still.Finally but not least as the real star of this movie, dragging it up to a 5 star film ( some how ) is the incredibly talented comedy actor ( with really great comedy timing ) Kumail Nanjiani who plays Kingo to perfection as this is a very likeable & entertaining character who makes the movie in the few parts he is allowed to be in enjoyable as he makes me laugh which is good.( He played Pindar Singh in Franklin & Bash & was excellent in that too ).Hopefully the Marvel universe will be much more protected in the future & they won't just let anyone write a script & direct it, as we as fans expect high quality from Marvel movies & Eternals is a movie we all need to forget.( however any of the actors or their characters should not be punished for this dreadful film, as yes a sequel should be cancelled however these actors deserve a chance to be in a very good marvel film when it is time for them."
220,6,Power Rangers gets serious Not the best offering in the MCU. It's over long and a bit dull. Some interesting bits and great visuals but it's just lacking. It's a film by numbers and I rarely felt invested in the characters. The characters rarely felt invested in themselves and would happily change beliefs at the drop of a hat. The bad guy was a bit like diet Ultron and given little time to impact the story. Hopefully they make more impact in the inevitable sequel.
221,2,"Unwatchable It was a waste of money to watch it in theaters when I did, I do not recommend this movie to any soul who reads this review. I beg you do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!There's only 2 things I liked about this movie, the famous Indian guy and his manager. That's it. Only 2 characters I liked about the movie.The Story is stupid. Takes too long for anything to happen. Movie attempts to humanize ALL THE CHARACTERS. Which none of them are very likeable. You don't find any tension to the fight in the end and literally the ""Superman"" commits sudokucide flying into the sun. One guy gets dropped out of the sky and comes back out of no where without a scratch (the guy that should've died is physically weak but his power is op and it's the ability to control minds) just to make a joke when he knocks out the little girl. Everyone is super bland and felt more like I was watching ""power rangers"" the tv show version. I understand the story is based on the creation of the world based on a myth or legend, but even with that reference I still found it incredibly dumb.I do not like how the eternals are so easily willing to betray their master. I think the movie would've been better showing how these characters lost their humanity for living so long. Losing loved ones and watching their sons and daughters and grandchildren die over the years. Fighting without a cause for so many years, losing meaning in their existence. I would think these ""immortals"" or should I say ""eternals"" (I hate saying that word) would be less human and more insane or more stoic throughout that time. But this is Disney we are talking about so that will never happen."
222,1,Who needs character development The most plot driven Marval formula type movie yet. The best part of this whole movie is the post credit scenes. They ignored all opportunities to even attempt to surprise the audience.
223,1,Just Horrible Horrible. Could not even let kids watch it. Kids cant watch super heroes anymore thanks to the degenerates and sicko's. Are there any REAL superhero movies/shows out there that are not guided by the devil?
224,2,"Watching this to the end would be a challenge Tried hard to avoid the characters speaking in strong regional accents (Remember ""a lot of planets have a North ... "" ? ) but it just detracted from the film and then the whole thing just started to drag into mind numbing boredom to the point where sleep or death would be a welcome change.Hopefully there will not be a sequel."
225,4,"Gemma Chan is the Gem of this Dull Film This movie felt like the MCU made a DCEU movie. By DC standards, it's a serviceable film; by Marvel standards it's an abysmal misfire. However, Gemma Chan deserves 10 out of 10 stars. Unfortunately, we're rating the movie here and not her. The movie is just not very good. Even Captain Marvel, Iron Man 3, and Thor: The Dark World are better than The Eternals film. At least, it's not as bad as The Inhumans."
226,4,"Tried to give it a chance but too many flaws. Not counting the Zac Snyder-esk cinematography of bland colors, this movie is long and a bit all over the place. The Eternals are sent to Earth, most of them except their leader Ajax, believing to only fight Deviants and it being their first mission, eventually wiping all Deviants out in the 1500s, or so they believe. But in actuality they are there to make sure humans can populate the Earth enough to birth a Celestial, Tiamut, somehow and Deviants were the first attempt at doing this but went awry. So Ajax should have stepped in when fighting Thanos, or any other major human conflict that could have resulted in the extinction of the human race, since that would have majorly delayed this supposedly important emergence.Then there is the fact that Asguardians are supposed to protect Midguard, aka Earth, how did none of them know about the Eternals, Deviants, or their purpose considering this is an ongoing thing throughout the universe on many different planets? Tiamut began to emerge and they manage to stop it, but it should have done massive damage to the planet at that point, then the Celestial that sent them, Arishem, appeared as well and that should have done gravitational damage too due to how massive it was, but all it does is push some clouds away inexplicably when it is above the atmosphere.It is also revealed that there were some Deviants alive, because Ajax had a change of heart during Thanos' snap, but didn't do anything in the time after until a week before Taimut began to emerge and the second in command, who she told their real mission about centuries prior, betrayed Ajax by throwing her to the Deviants. The Deviants took her healing ability and began to evolve, saying they wanted to live, which was why they killed humans. So with Taimut emerging and the majority of the Eternals wanting to stop it, hense the Deviants would live instead of dying like the rest of Earth's inhabitants, the Deviants decide to try to kill the Eternals and side with those that want Taimut to emerge.Finally there are mid credit and end credit scenes just like all other MCU films that just leave more questions than anything.The acting and CGI was good, no problems there. If the film was a standalone that didn't tie in to other Marvel movies, it would not have been taken down a notch for me with the issue of lack of Asguard interaction. Maybe they will talk about this issue in a future movie, but I don't see many people talking about this point, so it is very unlikely they will."
227,1,"The Eternals / the eternal sleep in the chair The Eternals / the eternal sleep in the chair, very boring and without subject, without interest, I could see the movie without sound, it does not make sense and I can not understand the existence of this movie, of course it is better than matrix 4, both movies do not make sense in the script, that is, they are just productions for collecting tickets."
228,10,"Not an Avengers movie - and that is a good thing A lot of the reviews here seem to fidn this film boring. Yes, it is not as fast paced as other Marvel movies, especially those of the Avengers variant, but that is a good thing. I actually new what was going on on the screen while I was watching it instead of being bombarded with fight scenes in which the camera is forced to give every big name actor equal screen time.The Eternals spends a lot of time allowing the viewer to get to know the cast through flashbacks. Since we have never seen these characters this only makes sense. And it is done beautifully. The movie is long, yes, but it is only boring if you expect fight scenes and destruction every few minutes. If this is so, then this is not the movie for you.The relationships between the incredibly diverse characters, the back stories, the secrets - all of this is slowly revealed. The movie focuses less on fighting and effects and more on the emotions of the characters. I cannot say more as I do not want to spoil it, but unless you expect another Marvel Action flick, then you should just give it a try and realize that this movie just does not fit into the Marvel formula - and that this is a good thing."
229,5,"Way too Sleep-Inducing for Me Perhaps my days of enjoying radical science fiction and farcical fantasies are over. I halfway slept-watched through the first 2/3 of it before getting up and leaving and stumbling into the most delightful movie of 2021 and that was ""Last Night in Soho.""I have enjoyed Angelina Jolie in other projects as well as Salma Hayek. But this looked too much like a posing competition between the two."
230,2,"diaster Sadly it's the worst movie marvel ever made, they killed the whole story of comics and the characters.Poor and completely predictable writing .Well done Disney you are killing Marvel cinematic universe."
231,1,"Sad excuse for entertainment A total waste of $200 million not to mention 2hours and 36 minutes of my life... Lots of named actors, good actors but sadly the plot, the script and the dialog leaves a lot, I say a lot, to be desired. Love the Marvel films as a rule but this... isn't one of them."
232,6,"Typical copy and paste formula This is yet another marvel movie that sticks to the all familiar path that we have seen so many times before.The CGI as improved but not much else.Personally i wish they would stray from the path and allow some individuality. Think The Dark Knight.Dare to be different, but stick to the source. Know what a title should stand for and plan accordingly rather than copy and pasting the script and the cringe Hollywood humour designed for every superhero movie. (Which is how many now? 20? 30?)You'd think you would be improving after this many attempts.. seriously how do these movies keep getting worse?The acting was half decent at least, you can't blame the actors here.Run time was about 45mins too long, typically filled with far too many unnecessary scenes.All in all. If you were to skip this you wouldn't be missing much. But if you're extremely bored or a CGI zombie (meaning you will watch any movie and think it's good as long as it looks nice) then by all means give it a crack. It is watchable, but just barely."
233,8,"Good action, the love triangles need to be tuned down tho I liked the movie and loved the superhero action. Of course there are some major issues. Like when you create a new line of superheroes in the same universe as the MARVEL heroes, you can't just say they didn't take part in the fight against Thanos because they don't indulge in ""human wars"". Thanos was clearly an inter-galactic villain, not just a foe to humans. His intentions to remove half of the universe's population clearly clashed with the duty of the Eternals to let Earth's population burgeon so that Tiamut could awaken.Also, I think the love triangles were a pain in the a$$."
234,6,Total misfire RATED 6/10 Language: English Source: HotstarMore childish than expected... looks like all field out actors are joined together for the grand failure. As a story it starts grandly but the story flow and climax are looks like transformers movie than Marvel super hero one... When I see Salma Hayek as head of the team then I set my expectation to the least level... still it failed to satisfy.... Good in CG and some action sequences.... but as a whole its total misfire...
235,4,Boring storytelling Such a great cast... Such a pitty. The movie was really boring to myself ( I am a big MCU fan which is pretty darn disappointing). I don't know... My face was 😐 the whole film and I was praying to see it finish faster after 1 hour of boredom. Maybe I will give it a second chance... Maybe... And watch it again with better attention.
236,3,"Boring It's a two and a half hour bore-fest.So slow it manages to stop time.All the characters are boring.Even the action, what there was of it is boring, standard stuff.I have no idea how they managed to make a superhero film boring. The entire point of a superhero film is to be thrilling and exciting.That alone must take talent and is worthy of 10/10."
237,3,Very pretentious but uninteresting movie It seems to me that producers of this film had in their mind a goal to make it as much inclusive as possible instead of making something good out of this story. Every minute of this movie is so boring that it is literally a torture to watch it. Very deplorable to see so poor quality from Marvel.
238,2,"I almost turned it off, that never happens. Yikes, I wanted so badly to love this movie as there are some great actors in this. Sadly, this movie was lacking in several areas. The story was weak, the pacing was sloooow, missed the mark on some casting (needed more Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie brought absolutely nothing to her character - maybe they should have switched rolls). Gemma and Madden are pretty to look at but they were missing something, especially in their live story. There were a few good performances from Brian Tyree Henry, Harish Patel and Don Lee. The shining star in my opinion was Kumail Nanjiani. He got ripped for the part and it showed. He had the right sense of humor Marvel movies have been known for and I appreciate. Most of his scenes were hilarious and the rest were bad-ass because his actions scenes were the best all around. I wanted to see more of him fighting. He said 'peace out' for the big climactic ending and was sorely missed. Also, the antagonists were lame, prehistoric alien dinosaur creatures has been done before and better. What a disappointment."
239,7,"Imperfect compared to the best of MCU but worth watching This movie does diversity incredibly well, and the characters are simply diverse because the casting is diverse, not as plot devices. This is so incredibly rare in Hollywood, where most attempts at ""diversity"" is forced and out of touch. This is no easy feat and deserves recognition. The movie is also less formulaic and mindlessly entertaining, and contains more mature themes with deeper philosophical questions, moral ambiguity, complex relationships, and drama. All great breaking the mould for a Marvel film.However, some of the script is painfully cheesy, the characters lack chemistry (except a certain brooding ""teenager"" and speedster), and so many key characters are simply used as plot devices then tossed aside. Not to mention awkward video-game-esque fight scenes and unrealistic CGI. Great casting, ok directing, & poor dialogue. Overall not a waste of time, but compared to the great chemistry of Spider-Man, action of Shang Chi, and masterpieces like Endgame... this film doesn't measure up."
240,10,"In my top five I loved it. This movie was absolutely astonishing.I loved Druig and Makkari's energy, I was engulfed in Sprite's emotional well-being. The betrayal, the action, the romance, I couldn't get enough.You won't regret watching it."
241,9,"Unlike other Marvels MArvel movies have a formula, but I felt like this movie was outside of the normal scheme. I like the dynamics of the characters and the diversity is always welcomed. I felt like every character was sufficiantly well introduced to make me feel for them. I had seen some really bad reviews but I really liked it."
242,7,"Very long I like, that the MCU is trying to introduce new and fresh characters. The Eternals were a great addition and I enjoyed it. It definitely feels different from any other marvel movie ever, which is nice. The characters didn't have much time to evolve, because they are 10 Eternals. The story itself is basic and alright. It's not easy to find something really bad or really good about this movie. It was just there."
243,3,"What is this! I dont know dude! Is it marvel? I can't believe that marvel made this with that story and characters choices! Two hour circle story with bad artists just waste my time, I expect so much more than this, I couldnt stand at it like Im watching boring lecture about trash talks and acts from trash players, hope they wont do that again and ignore these stuff like racist behavior in their movie, its not a right way."
244,8,"Pretty good movie I enjoyed the movie a lot, had some pretty good characters which will be cool to see more of their backstories and how they develop. 2 and a half hours is a very long run time though which while it was good for story development, at times felt a bit like a drag and just waiting for the movie to end. Recommended."
245,7,"Too much. Too soon While The Eternals maintains the standard of MCU production value which it does with its signature CGI; it falls short of the development level that the MCU's O. G. superhero team the Avengers. The Avengers ascended to their heights because the actual team up was built upon with the introduction and development of the individual characters before cramming them together. With 6 films in 4 years the build up to The Avengers was unparalleled up to that point.Now ,seemingly, in an attempt to reverse engineer a superhero franchise we leap right past a mear 7000 years to find the audience having to get the abridged version of character development. Yeah sure, effort was made to establish some humanity in The Eternals by pairing them off but it feels a bit forced. Kevin Feige has yet to foul up so I'll take The Eternals as anything but half-cocked. Perhaps with the ever growing slate of MCU mini series on Disney+ maybe we will get to see some better explanation as to what they were all up to for all that time...at least since Babylon. 🤔"
246,5,"This had promise, but this movie was the expendables of the MCU It was miscast, the plot and story were a mess. Really couldn't get away from having Sersei(Cersei) and not one but two GOT actors. Ikiris was the obvious killer of Ajack and it wasn't close. What a waste of almost three hours."
247,1,Noce boring movie. When the filmmakers do everything according to modern quota requirements as result have this nice and warm smelling. Marvel's worth film. How can I get my money back?))
248,1,Eternally bored Dumb and soul less.You can add 200 millions $ it will never be a good film .Casting is weird . Each character came to take his check.Not logic and poor scenario.
249,3,Waisted opportunity to make a great film! I am big fan of the actors . But this film is really a bit hard to swallow. Its picks up about 30 minutes in but is short lived it a very waisted opportunity to match a great film from this story line ! Yep it's a bit of a turd!
250,5,"Disappointed I went into the film knowing how divisive it is, but as always I keep an open mind. The film isn't a dumpster fire, or the worst superhero film ever made; it's simply uninspired and misguided. Throughout the lengthy runtime, characters either walk from place to place or sit giving exposition for minutes on end. Leading to an uneven narrative flow that is also bogged-down by sparse fight scenes that aren't thrilling. There's a talented cast here, and the film is often gorgeous to look at. The problem is, the film can't convey why it's important to be in the MCU. Not every movie is a winner."
251,8,"With Marvel movies I learned one thing on here, don't listen to the negative reviewers. Again a lot of negative reviews on here. Negative reviews from people that will never be satisfied, whatever movie you make they will always bash it down. The funniest of them all is from a reviewer rating it with three stars. He watched it twice! Is that not ridiculous? Watching a movie that you score that low twice? I only watch movies that I really liked twice and Eternals is going to be one of them. The story is interesting, the CGI's stunning, the acting more than decent (but that's absolutely normal when you see the great cast it has). There's clearly going to be a sequel, one that I will watch for sure. I just hope those negative people will skip that one, as it's going to be of the same level. So if you for some obscure reason didn't like Eternals just do us a favor and skip that one and let the Marvel fans enjoy their movies."
252,3,"I had a very high expectation I was very disappointed with this movie. The trailer seemed very promising and the casts line up were spectacular!However, the movie was very boring 😴 It even feels like it was not a Marvel movie.Such a waste of time."
253,1,Disappointing...wrong script I really don't get why every director try to highlight so much social and sexual orientations in movies now. What happened to the science fiction/action movies?
254,4,"Plodding and it feels like an eternity First off I hate the premise that all mankind's leaps in technology are courtesy of a bunch of patronising space tourists; conspiracy nuts who think humans are incapable of building pyramids, etc, must be having wet dreams watching this.Apart from highlighting how crap people are at anything, the biggest problem is the faux portentous dullness of the script; watching it is like being slipped a tranquilliser with your cornflakes before you even had a chance to wake up in the morning.And seeing the Game of Thrones actors just messed with my brain and I bet Angelina Jolie remembers nothing about filiming this."
255,3,"Notes I made while watching the movie Etetnal lets creature kill a man before beating it and stopping it from killing a young boyGirl hides from earthquake near a wall underneath a stone tablet, when all her colleagues hid under the tables. Was there no place for her? Couldn't she find some little space under one of the tables but instead hid in the most unsafe way imaginable?Sersei saves her and no one sees her doing that even though there is a guy at the wall 2 meters away from herAwful childish dialogue all throughout the movieEternals were not allowed to fight other villains, other than deviants but they'll surely join the Avengers in the next big Avengers movie as it is implied with this movie being in the MCUThe soundtrack was made as if the director watched Ramin Djawadi sketching the score for the movie and ordered him that every track should be as generic as possibleWhat an unefficient way of creating celestials who can create new worlds, by destroying the ones that exist. Wouldn't be better if the celestial emerged as the planet was about to die when eventually people brought their own demise and destroyed the world? So that one's destruction would give life to a whole new planet and millions of lives? It's not the best but it's a lot better than the moral questionable situation we got. Not to mention the questions this reveal arises: like how many planets are impregnated with a Celestial Tiamut? Were they all impregnated? If so then why destroy every life in the universe just to bring more of the same life? And how does a celestial use the power of humans? What kind of power do the humans have anyway? If say, in the beginning of the universe there was a limited number of inhabited planets and just as many celestials to emerge, was Arishem about to wipe out all life in universe just for a reset button? Man, that would make him even worse than Thanos.As we find out that Eternals are robots and Deviants are organic beings how can one organic being eat and incorporate a robot as well as its abilities?Thena somehow has a double personality or something and tries to kill fellow Eternals members which is explained that her mind was remembering memories from her previous lives as eternal, which begs the question: why nobody else developed this kind of memory bug? Surely wasn't this sub-plot invented only to generate more tension when the writers needed it because they were too creatively lackluster to create intelligently builded tension, right? That would be silly...It is implied that Druig who could control people takes control of the Spaniards and native americans as if he was their God even though that would change history and would surely be noted in history as the first proof of alien life on earthApparently the Eternals had Thor, Odin and Loki at their finger tips but now Thor has become a spoiled narcissistic Avenger and won't respond Kingo's callsLoki al over again: the celestials created the eternals and they were just puppets all along having no free will, but now being more empowered because... reasons... they will break free and create their own destiniesThe Eternals' ship looks like it barely has 2 meters in height, which begs the question how do they fit or have any space inside it?Phastos can somehow repurpose the sphere from inside Sersie in order to connect them all with each otherSersi can just stand up after being stabbed and even run towards the vulcano. Is she able to not only change the knife into water but also the wound into tissue? Can she also change the bacteria she got inside into living human tissue?At the end Phastos says they didn't die when Celestials were emerging because they were connected to the Celestial, yet we knew from earlier on that there was a factory where all eternals were created so you couldn't believe that what he said was true because it was already implied they never had any memory of that to begin with and those thoughts of them surviving were just reminiscences of them being built, right?If these quick notes didn't make it abundantly clear, let me say it loud and clear: this movie sucks! Is sucks for all te reasons mentioned above and for many other, which would take me too much time to analyse the movie and write them all down. This movie exhausted me too much, that I could do that. Nevertheless this was a boring, sterile, badly acted and without any stakes movie that let me without any interest of coming back and wanting to know more about the Eternals or whoever might join them in the future or if they will join the Avengers, which will probably happen. Avoid this movie even if it means not watching it on streaming platforms. It's 2,5 hours of your life you can invest them better. 3/10."
256,1,"Worst MCU movie Making Ikaris villain is the worst part of this movie and also love triangle in a superhero movie making it more disappointing movie of MCU. It deserves to be the worst by storyline, they could have with different storyline. Not recommended."
257,4,"Just terrible... So much more than a misstep. I just don't understand what they were trying to do. The story is awful, the characters were just horrendous and laughable. The most bizzare part is the merchandising campaign. Did the company not watch the movie? Who would buy these stupid toys? Children? I can see that now - ""hey mom, I want that guy who trys to murder all humanity and then commits suicide...""What a total and complete mess of a movie."
258,4,"So unfortunate Everything about this film unfortunately all has flaws. From the writing, the directing and the acting. It's just a mess through and through. Really is a shame."
259,5,"Big Budget But Uninspired In many ways, Eternals felt like more of a DC film and a Marvel one, and that is not a positive. Powers are at an extreme, characters are far from human and so unrelatable, and action sequences involve every power under the sun, so everything is special effects, taking you out of the film.Evidently Marvel wanted to make another film following the footsteps of the hugely successful Guardians of the Galaxy, but Eternals misses that mark as there is no real rapport between characters, it's just a series of well known actors dumped together.That isn't to say it's not interesting. The story is coherent, and largely interesting for the majority of the film. The Deviants aren't the most inspired villains, and the development of the main one feels downright stupid at times, but all in all the plot makes sense and twists along the way keep things moving. And they need to keep moving, because this is a long film.The big-name actors are more secondary characters than all the trailers and build-up suggested, and with the introduction of so many new charactera, and an entire universe, no one is given much chance to develop. We skim the surface of a number of bland heroes.It's still an okay film, but below the usual MCU standards, and the ending is still poor whether they changed it or not."
260,8,"Big, ambitious and solidly made Greetings from Lithuania.""Eternals"" (2021) is big, ambitious movie with big ideas and good execution. The concept which i won't spoil or go into details reminded of me of Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" (2010). Only ""Eternals"" went way more deep into it. You have to give a kudos to creators for bringing this grand concept to life.I liked the visual side of ""Eternals"" very much. This movie looks amazing. Cinematography was gorgeous, special effects were great. Acting was solid but no Oscar will be won here - its just a great cast doing their good jobs. Directing by Chloe Zhao was pretty good for this big of a movie - at the beginning of the movie i kinda felt that its going to be a mess, but soon it picked up and at running time 2 h 25 min this movie was a good watch.Overall, while far from being best in this franchise, ""Eternals"" is probably its most ambitious movie in terms of idea and concept. Execution was solid and overall this movie delivered for me."
261,1,"Bad timing, X-Men is better. For a 2 and a half hour long movie there certainly isn't much of a character build, it's just right into the action and it's too much like X-Men when it comes to being in the battles and such. At least with X-Men we got character introductions and build ups before teaming up and barreling. This movie just starts out with fights and is scrambled all over. Perhaps it's also just the timing of this movie's release, we seen so much of this already. The acting seems over the top as well or that they are trying too hard. Defiantly not Marvel's best film."
262,6,"""Throughout the years, we have never interfered... until now."" Even with it's epic sweep of time and space, this film didn't connect with me. We're introduced to Eternals Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sersi (Gemma Chan) in 5000 BC Mesopotamia, obviously in love with each other, and they get married in 400 AD during the Gupta Empire. Why the long wait? Similarly, Ajak (Salma Hayek) dies during the 400 AD sequence, but Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) doesn't find out about it until the present day in Mumbai. Really?? It's stuff like that, that take me right out of the story with it's distracting effect on what's happening. But wait a minute... In present day Iraq, Ikaris intends to protect the Emergence, and kills Ajak? What am I missing here? I thought Ajak was already dead for about sixteen hundred years, and there was no explanation for it. Fortunately there was some humor interjected into the picture with the characters of Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and the single non-Eternal human Karun (Harish Patel), who never met a camera he didn't like. For me, Karun had the best lines in the picture. As for the story, you could follow it okay if you paid attention, but after a while it just got too tedious for this viewer. And at two and a half hours, it gets a little antsy to sit through completely from start to finish. You might even say, it felt eternal."
263,10,"Great marvel film Can't wait for the second one, hoping is happen soon. This Marvel movie show how great is this world. And we can do so many great thing to our planet. The universe is so big and we all are energy. We can be so little but strong at the same time. I'm a big Marvel movie fan."
264,1,"Don't waste your time unless you're struggling to sleep I wanted to like this - I really did. Mainly because we have bought Disney+ for a few months and this is highly promoted there. Also because we (our family) have enjoyed the MCU so far.But, I just couldn't find anything positive about this movie. The pacing is terrible - when you pause to let the dog out and are annoyed to realise you have to sit through another hour of it you know something's wrong - and the plot is weak and unoriginal (yes there is at least one twist that wasn't entirely predictable, but by and large we've seen it all before). The characterisation is poor - I didn't find myself caring about anyone in particular. The scale is too grand and the supposed links with the MCU (or reasons why there weren't any) are lame. The acting is wooden - as other reviewers have said, several of the stars don't seem to care at all - and the casting was odd - Angelina Jolie?!? The CGI was extremely hit and miss but more miss in my view and the 'variants' just look awful. Then there's the classic superhero issue of how such powerful beings don't seem to make effective use of their abilities. The humour was ok in places, but not strong.Add to these fundamental flaws the pushing of limits on sexual content (what did the sex scene or the frequent kisses between couples add?) and we wished we hadn't pressed play. Perhaps my greatest gripe though is the inconsistencies in the nature of the eternals. Basically, they all had strong accents like those of countries in modern earth (Ireland, Mexico/Spain, England, USA, Korea, India) and one even spoke sign langauge (I assume the US variety). Their appearances matched the ethnicities we would expect with those accents. That might seem like a great stride towards diversity (no bad thing) but it is completely illogical. They came to earth 7000 years ago when these accents (and the English language they all speak in those accents) could not gave existed and why would they match earth ethnicities that presumably didn't exist then either?Sorry to be so negative. I did try to find something positive, but couldn't. My wife and teenaged daughter agree (well the latter would have given it a two and the former a three, so maybe I'm a bit tough with a one, but I stand by my rating)."
265,1,"Disappointing As a huge Marvel fan I was crushed to watch this poor excuse for an epic film.The film went wrong in;Lighting. First lesson for actors in film school is to find the light. Difficult when there isn't any. The art house ""natural light"" style doesn't work for action movies. Watching on Disney+ with full brightness on an OLED screen, the characters faces were bathed in darkness for the entire film, I couldn't see a thing.Plot. Three movies crammed into one, with no characteristic moments and bad foreshadowing in the form of disjointed flashbacks. It was like there were ""previously on eternals"" style catch ups littered throughout the film. Really interrupted what little flow there wasSo bad bad bad, may have been salvageable if I could actually see it, but it was more or less a black screen throughout, securing the position for the worlds worst podcast."
266,2,Justice league of Marvel This movies was even worse than the First version Justice league movie from Warner bros. Too many characters and all of them hard to connect with. Animation looked silly specially shooting from fingers . Come on! It was a long and boring movie. I have nothing good to say about it.
267,4,"No humanity Part of the MCU, they try to introduce a new set of superheroes these guys don't age and have been guiding human civilisation from the start, defeating some evil beasts along the way. I couldn't connect with most of them maybe 2/10 showed human emotion during each of their introductions. The main character desperately needed a connection to tie her back to her human life. Just take her boyfriend on the trip instead of forgetting him for half of movie. The movies long at 2 and a half hours it gets pretty boring with lifeless rocks with no connection to the real world. Everything a human says in this movie is more heroic than anything these 7000 year old heroes said the entire movie. It's also boring because of the lack of action with only a few fight scenes. During the pointless scenes which should have been cut, I was too busy thinking ahead and predicting the rest of the movie so there was only one surprise waiting for me in end. In short: make the movie shorter, make the main character actually main, make her likeable, just write it a lot better."
268,3,Boringg Wathching this make me feel priviliaged that I am a citizen of earth and so many saviours of this planet. But what we all are doing is loving dogecoin!😜😜😜😜 Utter BS movie. 3 star just for Salma Hayek😬😁
269,6,"Doesn't feel like an MCU film.... 6/10Being that this was my first time watching ""Eternals"" it was hard to go into this film without constantly thinking about how bad the film might be. While it wasn't horrendous, it certainly wasn't great.The MCU has been fantastic up to this point. While the films had us travelling around the universe the previous twenty-five films always felt grounded with some rhyme or reason to events and circumstances.Both literally and figuratively this film always felt like it was up in the air. Nothing felt constant and the fluidity dropped off several times during flashback events. And while the origins of these hero's was somewhat explained it didn't feel natural. The characters felt out of place in the world and lacked an emotional connection.A few positives to the film though was that it looked visually stunning. It worked well with IMAX enhanced. The music blended well to attempt to give some sort of connection to the film. Perhaps the best part of the film, though it felt somewhat like a list being checked off, was the diversity of characters. I think people will find that they connect with a least one character on some sort of level.In the end I just didn't feel anything for this film. It felt like it could exist, but not in the MCU as we know it. I'd rather new characters be introduced into the more Avengers aspect than to be in the aspect of ""Eternals"".Almost at the end of this twenty-seven film journey. Lucky for me ""No Way Home"" is still showing in IMAX theatres so I shall take advantage of that.Until next time.... Enjoy the show!"
270,5,"Perhaps best (and only) suited for kids? It's a gentle, magical adventure story, lacking in drama, lacking in jokes, lacking in great acting, lacking in a comprehensible story Not any good? It's a gentle, magical adventure story, with lots of (for me boring) CGI effects, perhaps best (and only) suited for kids, because this movie is seriously lacking in any sort of intense drama.No shocking violence, no swearing, no nudity. Safe and predictable. BUT kinda boring for an adult. But perhaps kids could like this stuff?More bad: there are some great actresses starring in it, but unfortunately there are also a lot of below average other actors.Even more bad: the story is quite hard to follow.Concluding: not annoyingly bad, because it has got a gentle feel, but it is kinda boring. NOT a winner."
271,1,Disney has eternally ruined marvel! Waste of my night! Disney has gone out of its way to try and put their inhuman ideology into others minds! I'm done with anything that will be made by Disney!
272,6,"Storyline is confusing While the cinematography is top-notch and there are several big name actors, the basis of the story and true purpose of the Eternals is confusing. At the end, I am left wondering if the film has a moral message and how everything connects."
273,5,"Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected. I waited a lot for this film and I was very excited, but unfortunately I was very upset after it was released and watched, of course it was a new style in its kind but the script had done very poorly and could have done much, much better, I was looking forward to playing Angelina Jolie in the film, which unfortunately did not play much role in the film and was little seen and, of course, relatively weak. But the story of the film was very interesting, making the viewer think."
274,2,"Yikes. Did anyone like this movie? Like really, genuinely, actually liked it because of the plot and acting and direction? I'd be stunned to see even one person who does.I feel bad for ALL of the actors. They are probably wonderful people.I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 for the graphics and stuff. :\"
275,8,"Worth a watch Not sure why this film is getting so much bad press, actually thought it was a nice departure from Marvel's usual fair. Visually very impressive, had some interesting themes of theology and some good gags. Less predictable than most of the recent marvel offerings."
276,1,"Special effects, that's all If you are looking to see a movie for its special effects, this is a good option. The arguments are terrible, their interpretation of history is almost denounceable. Maybe Marvel should spend more money in a good script instead of paying fortunes to actors and actresses."
277,7,"Deeply Beautiful Stunning visuals, incredible performances, Chloé Zhao's magic, awesome music, and a compelling story more than make up for the very necessary length of this innovative Marvel movie."
278,1,I wish i can give this movie 0/10 Bad story ever made. This is painfully and waste time of my life. Everything in this movie are so silly and dump. I was not belive the review give this movie 1/10 but after complete the movie than i wish i will i can delete this movie in my libary. Overall 0/10.
279,4,"The depressed Marvel movie no one wanted. When i learned that Chloé Zhao was tagged to direct and write a super hero movie, i had my doubts, considering that she's best known for doing gloomy personal dramas. Unfortunately my doubts were right.Eternals is nothing like the Marvel movies we know and love. Eternals is a gloomy uneventful affair, sprinkled with some small bursts of action.160 minutes of people with wooden personalities having pretty depressing dialogues about uninteresting things is not what i want from a Marvel movie. Not even the ""funny"" sidekicks and the more lighter characters manages to insert any humor. Eternals will be forgotten from my mind as soon as i type this dot."
280,2,Worst Full Boring and worst movie of Marvel studios . Don't waste your time to watch this disaster movie 😂 . I went to see this movie in the theater and there were only 9 people that too on the first Sunday.
281,7,"7000 years in 2.5 hours A team of superpowered Eternals are sent to earth in 5000BC by a Celestial god to safeguard humanity against monstrous Deviants.Controversial opinion: The solution to the mess that is Eternals ... is more Eternals. This should have been a TV series.I came to this conclusion as I took in Eternals over several sittings, wishing that they'd fleshed things out more.The actors are stiff and aloof because they're playing immortal super beings who are stiff and aloof, if not jaded, without ever showing us how and why they get that way.Throughout the film the Eternals talk about the various falling outs and reconciliations they inflict upon each other over the ages.It would have been great to see some of these alliances and betrayals take place, and watch as their ideals get slowly eroded or modified.Instead, cast and crew had the unenviable task of jamming seven millennia of backstory into two and a half hours, in a way that at least made some sense. I concur with the reviewer who likened this compressed disappointment to Watchmen the movie.Eternals also squandered the potential to build up massive questions about death, remembrance, duty, and trade-offs.The art design theme of golden thread and circles, apparently based on astrolabes, is amazing. Scenes range from small and intimate to planetary. The pacing is often ponderous and somber. At these points, Eternals reminds me of a contemporaneous release: Villeneuve's Dune. However, I had more fun with Eternals as the Marvel habit of adding a wisecrack here and there stopped the dourness from getting boring.And unlike Dune, I think I would not have minded seeing more."
282,10,"Its so fantastic It has different formula in terms of MCU. But it still amazes me a d the plot twist really did so much to me to love this movie. The slow pacing of it, helps me to more understand it, the movie maybe lacks action sequences but the final fight Is so awesome and it focuses more in the story which I really loved."
283,2,"Boring. Rated 2 stars because rating it 1 star would not count in the calculated average. I'm presently sitting through this turkey for the third time as my son watches it on Disney Plus. The only reason to see what goes on in this movie is to understand how it fits in the MCU. Don't waste your time watching it, just find out the spoiler info.It broke my sense of wonder and transcended my willing suspension of disbelief."
284,2,"Terrible in every way possible. This is a Marvel epic in the style of an awful B movie of old. Appalling script, dreary incoherent dialogue, no main storyline as it swings from one pointless dead-end to another. Even the actors appear to be completely confused about what's going on. It would get a 1 if it weren't for some great FX. Give it a wide birth; it's a complete dud."
285,1,"boring as hell You simply cant' connect with this movie not sure if it's the constant fashbacks, the bland acting, the story plot but most likely a mix of the 3; basiclly spend the movie wondering if something was actually going to happen but was sorely disappointed, definitly won't watch it again as it's extremely boring, sure hope if there's a sequel they drasticly rethink the concept."
286,1,"Abysmal A terrible film. Boring characters, awful action, bland and pretentious beyond belief. The cast have no chemistry, the leads are charisma free and the villians are rubbish and poorly designed. Black Widow was bad but this is much, much worse. Shang Chi was an average movie with a likable cast so it gets away with its weaker moments but this... it feels like watching a Zack Snyder movie but devoid of even having the odd cool moment. Dreary trash."
287,1,A big disappointment I've been watching marvel cinematic universe since 2008.....this movie - with all the great superstars in it - made me feel like all that time was for nothing A wast of time and money...it seems that even marvel needs to learn when to stop.
288,4,"This just kept going. This just dragged on. Half way through I was like OMG I'm only half way through. How many times do we have to hear I love you Sersi? Every character is pretty boring but we all love you Sersi!! When the movie was finally done, they added an extra bit to set it up for a sequel. The movie is well paced, entertaining and a little disjointed. It's definitely not the Marvel of the past 15 years since Disney took over. I think it's a 4/10 which it better than a lot of movies. It needed far more structure, story telling and character development or background to launch it up towards 8 which no Marvel film is ever going to get near to. So it's typical for a Marvel movie to score a 4 and anyone that disagrees is just wrong. I am the god of you all and you will respect my authoritie!! ><"
289,1,"Don't watch, Waste of time I was so disappointed that marvel could make suck low quality movies. They should take this movie off just to save the embarrassment. It's very long movie with a lot of uselss scenes. It's nothing like other mavrvel movies."
290,1,"huge disappointment After the unfortunate Inhumans series, I was happy to see Marvel Studios make their own attempt as a superpowered groups and....well... I'd actually recommend the Inhumans series over this, at least that one isn't taking itself so seriously."
291,2,"Huh? I'm a huge Marvel fan and really like several of the actors in this movie so I was really looking forward to watching it. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed. Seems like the movie makers were more focused on having a diverse cast than they were on an actual storyline that made any sense. Too much fluff...not enough good story-telling.The ""super heroes' we're barely able to use and/or understand their own powers. Plus connecting this to the other Avengers movies seems pretty desperate and hard-pressed.This seriously isn't worth the 2 1/2 hours that it takes to sit through it. You are better off going back and watching the Iron Man movies again."
292,7,"Entertainals 90 degree watchable... It means you don't have to lay flat from boredom. But neither are you tense.My issue is not the political agenda. Heck, we are watching magic, why not believe people are equal.Magic is in fact the issue. The fiction without science. Just because you can with CGI, it does not mean you have to dumb down the plot. It illustrates how technology negatively affects narration."
293,5,"Way too long It needed to be at least 30 min shorter, it's like they released a directors cut as the theatrical version lol. So many unnecessary scenes, too many flashbacks. I hate when a movie treats the audience like they're dumb and gives us way too much exposition. There were some plot holes but I overlook that stuff when it's a comic book movie. Acting was good, but none of the characters were particularly likeable except for Kingo & Phastos.Visual effects were good. Wish it was more action and less of the hammering of backstory.If you're someone who loves all marvel / superhero etc movies then you'll probably like this one too."
294,7,"A different marvel, a different time I enjoyed the Eternals. It have a time period that Marvel didnt often use in their movies. I enjoyed also the cast that i found in my opinion pretty well and work well together. They have well made action scenes, nice fights and beautiful environment: it was really a pleasure to follow along the story and the characters. It was a pretty different Marvel and still have the same recipe and still work."
295,2,"I really did not want to write this review Because every minute spend on this movie is a waste of your life, but seeing the desperate attempts of how brutally this huge steaming pile of nothing burger (at best) is advertised to be the next best thing since the invention of the wheel, forces me to write this in order to warn people.Don't waste your time on this!It's probably the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making considering how much money and how many big names and professionals of their trade are involved.Beyond cringe.2 Stars for fairness: The effects are great (duh...) and Angelina Jolie is doing a good job but is without a chance against everything else that is wrong with this movie."
296,5,"Not as bad as some say, not as good as some say Positives:End battle sequence is brilliantCGI is for the most part fantasticThe main few characters are very strong and their powers are very different to anything else in the MCUThe locations are diverse, and refreshing in contrast to the MCU which is set mostly in citiesWelcome introductions of post credits charactersGreat to see the celestials and deviants on screenDisadvantages:"
297,5,"All wrong in so many ways I got the feeling that the Avengers would give these ""gods"" a run for their money blind folded with their hands tied behinds their backs. This is poor writing, and everything. The 5 stars are for simply outstanding visuals and sound."
298,3,"Arishem carried Only giving it a 3 star because of Arishem the judge and the beautiful cinematography. If not for them I wouldn't give it a single star. Literally nothing happened in a 3 hour movie, except we understood that they were here thousands of years ago, they saved us from the deviants, bla bla bla but this could be told in an 1 and a half hour movie. Way worse than Thor: the dark world and can comfortably say this is the only Marvel movie I would never watch twice... I've watched all of the other ones at least 5 times..."
299,3,"How dare they? A too long and boring, incredibly sexist movie. I couldn't believe they did it. I guess it wasn't cancelled only because it was directed by a woman.I'm not a hardcore feminist, but I was offended by the main story, that without giving out the plot is this: a team of professionals was charged to do a specific job. A woman was appointed as the project leader. As the project went along she shared confidential information with another team member. This information gravely damaged the relations inside the group and brought it into complete dissaray. (the woman couldn't keep her mouth shut, right?). On top of that she let emotions (women and emotions, I get it) rule her and felt like abandoning the project completely. Another woman was appointed by the corporate to lead the team instead. The second woman succumbed to her emotions as well and utterly failed at her job, leading the project to a complete disaster, immesurable losses for the corporate and the loss of the most capable coleagues.So, we have two out of two women leaders who fail because they couldn't think strait.The bottom line is... WOW, what did I just watch?"
300,7,"6.5 out of 10 is accurate I've always thought IMDb ratings (after a sufficient amount of time) end up being quite accurate as to the quality of a movie. In this case I definitely agree but wanted to add a review here just to push down the nay sayers who are giving it a 1 or 3.Without long winded explanations (like the movie) it's quite simple why you shouldn't listen to the low ratings for this one.5.0 out of 10 Was I entertained and interested in the story enough to watch the whole thing? Yes. That automatically puts it above 5 out of 10. Pure and simple.6.0 out of 10 Was it good enough to feel like it was worth the $15 at the cinema and engaging enough for me to have a heated debate about it after with my friends. Also yes. That automatically puts it above 6 out of 10. Easy.7.0 out of 10 Am I willing to go and see it again (at the cinema) and unquestionably recommend it to friends? Probably not. That means it definitely isn't above a 7. Makes sense.6.5 out of 10 Am I willing to give it another chance a few months later based on how likeable (some of) the characters are? Or how interesting the story was (even if it was very long with plenty of fluff)? I would say, on balance, yes. That, to me, puts it at 6.5. I hope some people agree with me on this because giving such a well crafted movie a 1 or 2 rating is really quite absurd.Anyway, I won't go into all the positives and negatives since others cleave covered it but the main thing I need to say is that the main fault if the movie is that they were intentionally trying to build an avengers style team but with absolutely no build up.This meant we were left with 8 or so backstories all crammed into a movie that should have focused (finally) on explaining the celestials in more detail other than what Ego told us in GOTG2. It was a rushed addition to the universe which isn't Marvel's style. A shame really considering how well they created the slow burner of phase 1/2/3/4.In short, the movie is good enough to watch again at some point, so it's a 6.5."
301,5,"Too Long !!! Obviously the MCU spared no expense producing this movie. The special effects, scenery, sets, and action was terrific. Even the acting, dialogue and humor was good. And I imagine Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie weren't cheap.But it goes on forever. I streamed it. It took me four sittings to make it through to the end. And the story doesn't make sense. I know it's make believe. But the Eternals were told not to interfere with humanity except to protect them from the Deviants. But one Eternal says he gave humanity the atomic bomb. And then complains he only made things worse. People keep killing each other. If he didn't want mass destruction, why give humanity the atom bomb?And? It's okay for the Germans and Japanese to attack, murder, rape, and enslave neighboring countries and exterminate other ethnic groups? But it's not okay the United States used the atomic bomb to end a vile threat to humanity? That makes lots of sense.And I really don't know what Angelina Jolie was doing in this movie. She wasn't even a lead character. She's more like a supporting character. And compared to the other eternals, she just looked old with her big head, skinny body and frizzy hair. And her acting was the worst compared to all the other eternals. Salma Hayek still looks good. And all the other eternals were young."
302,9,Masterpiece but not for little kids For people with brain is one of the best marvel movies. It give us alot about our history and i just love it. And its very powerfull with big pictures.
303,1,"Boring af Nothing like the quality u were used to from the previous Marvel films. Totally random cast, no character development so u dont give s s*** about any of them, even after 2h runtime and ofc the obligatory must-have gender standards these days wich leads to a total characterless experience. In the end its just a very bad teenage-movie with no edges and hell of a budget going nowhere. Hope they dont make a second one and just move on."
304,1,Dogs dinner of a film Just terrible. No empathy or engagement with the characters We just don't care. Poor plot twists and the powers bestowed on the cast are a joke. Also possibly the most wooden performances I've ever seen in a film.
305,3,"Splendid visuals but unconvincing plot The production values, art and fx are simply stunning. But - for me - when the Eternals started to get all emotional about the poor doomed humans (no spoilers), I just lost interest. Talk about predictable.Let's face it, lesser species don't ever do well against superior ones. Lookin at you, native americans, africans, aboriginals - even neanderthals!I rest my case."
306,7,"Is it a bad movie?? Contrary to the negative reviews of critics and some viewers, the Eternals is not so bad and has not deserved all these negative reviews. And we should not say the whole movie negatively because of a short sequence and devalue the movie In my opinion, the director of this film appeared in the first experience of making such a successful movie, although it was not the movie Masterpiece, but as the first experience in a new style for a director, I agree (for friends who do not know, I meant that this The director is the director of drama films and this film was the director's first film in a different style for himself) One of the positive points of this film is its very beautiful special effects, which in my opinion were better than the special effects of other Marvel movies, because the worthy director of this movie shot the film scenes in real locations. Real made Of course, the movie has another positive point, and that was the existence of a talented musician, Ramin DJavadi, who once again proved with his beautiful music that he is one of the best in the world as a composer for movie."

308,2,"Fell asleep twice Terrible movie, terrible script (could have been amazing considering they had ALL of human history to work with), terrible direction.Sadly this is the end of the MCU for me. With all that money they could have hired smarter writers and not just brainwashed people."
309,7,"It's hard to understand their choice Although it is a superhero movie and therefore brings with it all the problems of that film genre, it turns out to be quite interesting.However, the characters are too many and although we have tried to give equal space to all of them, the result is that they are all underdeveloped. There are also some problems with the choices that some characters make and which are questionable if not even meaningless."
310,1,"Worst The worst,poor film that I have watched. It's like children's story. The costumes are the worst pick.ost of the actors no reaction in their face at all. The Korean actor and the indians and of course Angelina Jolie, If not for them it's not worth at all. Story the worst."
311,1,"This movie is horrendously confusing Little to no character development; Abrupt plot; Inconsistent story; Way too many characters; Visuals that make you dizzy.The reference to marvel only hurts this movie, you can't genuinely believe in what's happening because things are brought to the movie for no good reason."
312,6,"So much potential, but didn't get there to where Marvel usually does An English teacher of mine once told us to ""show, not tell"" when writing. This movie tells, but doesn't show, quite a bit, and that makes it difficult to relate to quite a few of the characters. The movie tries to cover so much ground that, on a first pass, it felt like I couldn't keep up, but then on a rewatch, it was hard to get through. Honestly, it felt more like a DC movie.I think this would have been better as a Disney plus series because there are so many in the group to get to know, and the Eternals, unlike the Avengers, come as a unit. With the Avengers, you could deal with each character's backstory (except for Black Widow and Hawkeye.................) before the ensemble film and so you had some connection to the characters and could be more invested in the movie, plus the movie didn't have to introduce you to the characters AND tell a story at the same time. The Eternals though, you can't really separate them and have a movie about Sersi, for example. But then the movie is trying to accomplish intro'g the characters and telling a story and it's too much in a short span of time.The way the movie goes, you barely get to know some of them before certain things happen. And then I honestly had so many questions like - why did so-and-so act like that, or care about that, or whatever? There was so much on the motivations of the characters that was missing.The richest parts of the film were usually interactions between some of the Eternals (Makkari and Druig! Gilgamesh and Thena! Sersi and Thena!) and also the visuals, as well as parts of the final fight.We'll see where this leads in the future."
313,2,Worst marvel movie Very disjointed. Story has little flow. Unnecessary agenda pushing as well.The characters don't belong together. Story sucks.Great actions though. Only reason it's 3 stars.
314,2,"All the money was spent on the actors Maybe it lives up to the comic books, maybe it does a great job at portraying the characters and how they were written in the comic books, I don't personally know, as I've never really read any comic books beyond a handful of obscure ones.What I do know is, I wouldn't pay money to see this movie. This is a lazy Saturday afternoon movie, where if it's on you'll keep it on, but as soon as they start to add commercials you're channel flipping for something better, and in the odd event you don't find anything better, you keep it on that channel and watch this movie. You can finally get your chores done while it plays in the background, because honestly you won't miss much anyway.You realize the story is very bland, the characters even blander, and the big named actors get hardly any screen time or any lines, seriously, count the number of lines each ""high-end"" actor was given.Trust me when I say, you won't miss much by skipping this movie, you won't miss much by skipping the next movie that happens to be tied to this movie, and possibly the other movies after that.As a normal, non-comic book type person, I loved the Marvel movies from Iron Man, to Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America, The Avengers, Spiderman, etc. This movie was none of those, it didn't grab me at any point making me want to know what was coming next. It had some funny lines here and there, but overall I could've wasted the 2 and a half hours spent watching it, on literally anything else.If you want to watch the movie because of the well known actors, do yourself a favor, pick any show, movie, etc. That any of them have been in, and watch that instead. You'll thank yourself later."
315,7,"Different Type Of Marvel Movies Eternals is different than other Marvel movies that usually an action movies with light stories. This is on whole other dimension. The story is about the creator of the universe, its guardian, and the apocalypse that will come.The view in this movie is stunning, absolutely beautiful. Good acting by the actors and actresses. And I like the twist in the end when the Eternals find out their true purpose on earth. With surprised sex scene and some biblical parallel story, like 7 days of creation, 7 days before apocalypse. The Eternals served as guardian angel while the Deviant are something like fallen angel. This movie is meant to be for more mature viewers.But the way they dragged the story for more than 2 hours maybe a bit too much. And they didn't picture the Eternals strong enough. Because they were supposed to be as good as Thanos. Godlike. But they looks like ordinary superhero. Superspeed? We already seen Quicksilver. Fighting ability? Black Widow does the same. Savvy Tech? Wakanda can catch up. Illusion? Like Loki isn't enough. Only Ikaris and Cersi had special superpower.And talking about Cersi. Is it really a good choice to have two Game Of Thrones actors (from Stark family!!!) to have love interest with someone named Cersi? I cringed everytime.Personally I like this movie. But I also understand why people will give the movie bad reviews."
316,4,"Boring and uninteresting There was a time when you were guaranteed a great movie experience with a Marvel film, unfortunately that is no longer the case. Hit and miss these days it seems. Boring characters and story."
317,5,"Worst Marvel Movie Though Eternals has an Intriguing plot, the execution is terrible. The characters had very little personality, it was hard to keep up with the story. As a devout Marvel fan, I am extremely disappointed in this film."
318,1,"Was marvel out of budget All I can say is all the ugly hollywood actors were selected to make a useless movies of eternal ""immortals"" who can die.wasted my time. Blah blah blah just to complete the 150 letters so I can upload this review."
319,5,"I bet Sheldon Cooper loved it From my point of view: too many historical (loose) ends that need to be connected. Also not sure about the function of this movie in the whole series/saga. Anyway: Sheldon probably had a blast. Or not, if it was not accurate enough..."
320,2,"A jumbled mess This is a mess of a movie. Over complicated plots some terrible acting and also some terrible accents, even though the accents are correct for the place (Irish, Scottish) they are too strong for general worldwide movie audiences. Jolie has the acting presence of a block of wood. I only gave stars for the special effects as the actors were seriously miscast."
321,7,I wrote down the downsides. I got bored in some scenes while watching it. The movie was long. I liked the characters but it was like they couldn't add different powers. They were all powers that we could see in different characters before. But I don't regret watching it either. Waiting for the second movie..
322,6,Too long but ....... Make sure you watch through the credits at the end and get a peep at sequel to come. Better than I expected though so will wait another few years for sequel.
323,9,"I find it good one! This film astounded me. After reading the critics' reviews, I's a little hesitant to see this film, but I went anyway! And I'm so glad I did.Chloe Zhao did an outstanding job of introducing so many new characters to the MCU. Each character was perfectly developed. The cast's diversity is also worth mentioning. Fell in love with each character, especially Druig. I just wish Makkari & Druig had more screen time together because their chemistry was off the charts. Thena played an incredible part, providing the perfect mix of vulnerability & strength. The platonic relationship with Gilgamesh was amazing & made such a nice change from the standard romantic relationships we're used to seeing. Ikaris & Sersi had fantastic chemistry, and the plot twist took me completely by surprise. Sprite played an amazing role. She managed to make me both like & dislike her character. Phastos was a welcome breath of fresh air; he exuded warmth and provided much-needed comic relief. Kingo was brilliant & kept a lighthearted tone throughout the film. Ajak was fantastic, yet she deserved more screen time.This film's visual effects were also breathtaking. Arishum was particularly realistic. The plot moved along at a nice pace. The ending had everyone on the edge of their seats.I'm hoping that Ikaris, Ajak, Gilgamesh can be returned. Within the MCU, they have so much more to offer. The introduction of Eros (Harry Styles) was flawless; the perfect casting!I'm looking forward to seeing his future MCU projects. I also have the impression that Eros & Pit will provide similar energy to Groot & Rocket. The introduction of the Black Knight & Blade was also fantastic.I'm looking forward to seeing where the Eternals go in Phase 4 of the MCU; I've a feeling it'll be iconic."
324,1,"It must be said... I am honest with you: I haven't seen the whole movie. It was enough to see the start ""In the beginning..."" to ask myself: ""If we don't want to believe in a God who created everything, then why are themes about creationism in popular movies promoted?"" It doesn't make any sense. The idea itself has no base before it starts. Why not letting this being a mystery in this Marvel Universe?And don't say ""It is just fantasy"" because we know pretty well that the movie industry reflects our society and has it's part in influencing the generations..."
325,3,Did I actually bother I rate this with Don't Look Up. Maybe one star higher. Dragged on. Great special effects. But...... Nah! Won't recommend or watch again. Come back Stan Lee. Jolie looks like a porcelain doll. Yadda yadda yadda.
326,7,"Not as bad as some reviews Thought this (although a bit long) was Entertaining and I enjoyed it, maybe some people expect too much , but it plodded along with a steady pace which I thought worked, set up sequels and crossovers very well."
327,4,"The most Derivative Marvel movie so far. It borrows heavily - and sometimes outright steals - from prior traditions and myths, right down to stealing the opening line from the Bible as ""In the beginning . . ."" And the story really concluding with - ""and the truth shall set them free."" Borrow much? Oh, wait . . . Since no asking seems to have been done, isn't that just stealing?One character is so much like Superman that one of the lesser characters says that he IS Superman, but the greater character rebuffs the child by saying he doesn't do capes. Batman is mentioned as well, and the powers of the Flash are borrowed, even though they are already borrowed from Mercury to the Romans and Hermes of Greek Mythology. But that's not the only one. Most of the main characters are derived from either Greco Roman Mythos or Hindi Mythology, and even more remote fables. One of the most amazing parts is that it steals so much from DC Comics without a single mention. :-(We have seen all of the super powers before, with different capes. The story is a variation on the Kraken with a touch of Thanos thrown in for the intergalactic measure. Like I said . . . Derivative."
328,6,"difficult to get comfortable with charecter Eternals as a movie is not that good. Plot line got messed up.Even if Marvel had this new representation of different cultures but I feel it is loosing its edge on making the plot classier.Like why do we have to show a civil war between the ""protagonists"" Doing all this takes us away from the essential part of the plot.Eternals is not your typical MCU movie. It had a more dark and mature side, which we generally get to see in DC movies Maybe because it was different, it had a fresher side to it. As I personally am not comfortable with the word 'change' I was not comfortable at first."
329,10,"Refreshing, Soulful, and Romantic I am baffled why critics didn't like this movie. It's quickly become one of my favorite movies in the MCU and it was honestly refreshing to watch. It was beautifully filmed, the graphics were stunning, all star cast of actors, funny, great soundtrack, and all around has a much more mature feel. I was so happy to see some actual romance too. ;-)Seriously ignore all of terrible critic reviews. I'm glad not all Marvel movies are trucks blowing up and action sequences. This one has some real soul to it."
330,2,"Close, but you're way off! Confusing mess.Too many main characters who are instantly forgettable, so much so, I had no ideas who was who.Icarus - his laser eyes do absolutely nothing to the enemy. He might as well shine a torch at them or send them a strongly worded letter instead.Angelina Jolie and Selma Hayek are in this movie. Are they? Are you sure?Why would the Celestials create a hearing impaired Eternal? Makes no sense!Why would the Celestials create a child Eternal with adult feelings? Makes no sense.Some of the cgi is good, most of the acting is poor.The dialogue is difficult to understand when the Scottish and Irish characters are talking and it's also incredibly boring.So, Thanos's brother is Harry Styles!! Oh dear.The story is terrible and full of plot holes.Close but you're way off!!! (Homer Simpson)"
331,7,"Slow as hell start, big cast, big climax As far as Marvel films go, this is a good breath of fresh air. Though, that doesn't mean it's a flawless film.I have a soft spot for this film, and want to give it a better review, but really I can't give it higher just because the ending and overall implications of the film going forward are so good.The first half is slow, it has a big job of laying the groundwork for who these characters are, where they cam from, can they make us care about them all, and can they give us a good enemy all at the same time. In honesty, I would have been happy with a longer film that smashed these jobs perfectly, but we got what we got.The variants are absolutely boring generic anti-hero stuff. As soon as one of them begins to get interesting (although still Pale-Orc style CGI'd.... gross), he gets killed off.But i would go as far as to say that the 2nd half of the film, the emergence plotline, the setting up for the future and some of the characters I am very much looking forward to seeing later on.Just a shame that the focal point of the eternals are two pretty boring and non-enthusiastic and non-charismatic or convincing characters.The humour though, spot on. Mercari and Druig, amazing. Gilgamesh, 100% should not have been the one to get written off. Thena only really served to make Gilgamesh appear more interesting, and IMO the killing off should have been reversed between the two. Ikaris was written well and the dynamics of their beliefs and motivations were done well before heading to the final confrontation.Overall, worth watching mostly for the cosmic storyline and about half the cast. The rest is forgettable. Fun, and still Marvel, but not int heir higher end of quality."
332,3,"Boring I didn't expect much to be honest but the movie was so freaking boring and all over the place. I didn't understand what was going on because of the dozens of flashbacks and night scenes where you can't see a thing (I watched it on my tv in a dark room). I only figured it out halfway through. At some point - when they found Druig - it slowly got more interesting and then later during the betrayal and fight scene I got bored again because I did not care about this character at all. So many great actors and characters in the movie, one would expect it to be good but the script, the directing was just off. Very disappointed."
333,2,"One of the worst Marvel films - and I've seen Howard the Duck Struggled to watch the film as either the actors, characters or script are not connecting to what can only be described as a very loose plot.With a great ensemble of actors and history of films this was such a wasted opportunity."
334,1,"Horrible Script & Storyline Proves all the money needed for top of the line high cost actors and special effects will not guarantee success or a enjoyable film. Sory was simply awful. Also, its fantasy and science fiction; but there has to be some common sense approach for consistency. Basic math is ridiculously off in timeline of when celestial, infinity stones, and period of recorded history on Earth. Lastly, way too much time trying to build up and explain characters and relationships. Made them unrealistic, unbelievable, and boring. Please do not make a sequel. No salvaging this storyline. Hinted and setup for follow on efforts; but please please kill any such plans; and maybe the pain of watching this will fade from audience memory in a decade or 2."
335,6,"Fair but kinda disappointing As title said, it's alright but could've done better. It's essential for the mcu to bring out the bigger universe. And it did clearly explained the higher life form above human, the celestials. Definetly one of my least favourite marvel movie. Honestly, Karun carried the movie in my opinion. The only factor made me willing to go the the cinema to watch this movie is probably Angelina Jolie, she was basically born to fit into the role. The field she radiates, her facial expression, the feeling she gives, the eye contact all of them strongly reflect her as a cool, complex character. And having a very strong ability. Like a goddess of war. Yea that's simply the most suitable way to describe her and the link to thena.Other than that, nothing really worth a mention. Just probably the fancy Hollywood cgi, screen effect etc."
336,7,"I am not sure they will/shall return... Well, not as bad as I thougt, but not nearly as good as it could be ever. I don't think it is spoiler, but we only learn what we already know from Gardian of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Only not as funny as it was there. Not enough story for 2 and a half hours. The post-credit scenes anounce a return, but these guys are not the new Avengers. Not cool, not funy and not interessting enough. Funny they try to joke about Batman and Superman. Is this anti advertiing? I think, this would not work in a DC Movie ;)"
337,1,Snorefest Finally found my motivation to write my thesis. It´s literally more exciting than this slow movie. This movie could´ve been 20 minutes without the plot to thin out. And it´s not very well acted. A fest of whole new level of WTF. I´ll just write my thesis while this movie keeps rolling and I haven´t missed anything.
338,5,"So-So Marvel I'll be honest, I didn't have high expectations for this movie. I usually enjoy Marvel movies and own just about all of them (except for Black Widow which I will never watch because of Scarlett Johansson) but there was something about Eternals that I just didn't enjoy.I liked the premise very much but a lot of the main characters were forgettable. The way the past was sprinkled throughout the present felt disjointed or jarring at times. I was actually very much surprised at Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Thena. I'm not a big fan of hers to begin with so I didn't have high hopes but I felt she did an incredible job with the character. Salma Hayek is also one I wouldn't term to be a favorite of mine but again, I was pleasantly surprised by her as Ajak. I also thoroughly enjoyed Brian Tyree Henry (but he rarely disappoints), Kumail Nanjiani and Don Lee.While I know Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were supposed to be the main focus, I don't think they have the charisma or star power to lead a Marvel franchise. I really wish more of the ""supporting"" characters had, had more screen time (including Kit Harrington). If they had spent more time on the other Eternals besides Ikaris and Sersi, I would've enjoyed it more."
339,8,"Leave your expectations of what a marvel film 'should be at the door, and enjoy this film for what it is. WARNING: Mild SpoilersI really, really enjoyed this film. It got bad reviews all around, I think because its a marvel film which doesn't follow the classic 'marvel superhero formula' which fans have come to expect after 20-30 movies or so.First of all it doesn't follow just one superhero, it follows about 8, and I think it does a good job of fleshing out the characters of most of them, which is a difficult thing to do in a movie with a 2.5 hour runtime (as opposed to TV shows with loads of episodes to flesh out character dynamics eg GoT). On top of this it manages to make the relationships betqeen the characters fairly meaningful, so much so that you can kind of understand their motivations for their POV's in the final act.The most interesting part of the film for me was the decision in the end which splintered the group. It was v thought provoking on the question which a lot of superhero films now pose; is it more important to save life so that those currently alive may live longer, or to extinguish life now so that more life may emerge in the future. This film does a fantastic job of really putting you, the viewer, in the centre of this dilemma.The film also has v interesting tropes of Gods, belief systems, survival and love. And on top of that the visuals and fight sequences are absolutely stunning.I feel it's a film you'll either enjoy or hate. One thing is for sure, if you haven't seen it, leave your expectations of what a marvel or a superhero film should be at the door, and enjoy the movie for what it is.My Actual rating: 8.8/10."
340,7,"Should have been a miniseries I'm quite surprised by the negative reception of this film. I thought it was an interesting stylistic experiment for the MCU and it actually paid off. The slow pace, heady themes and naturalistic locations all made the film feel more dramatic and heavy rather than cheesy entertainment like the other Marvel films. The scope of the story was very well established with a cosmic historical timeline. Each Eternal had their own unique characterisation and backstory and I definitely felt the family dynamic. Karun was a great addition to keep things light.However, there was too much to cover in one film. While it keeps up a deft juggling act between the past and present, the film somehow felt too long and yet not long enough given the material it had to show. It should have been a miniseries to truly immerse us in the backstories like the romance between Sersi and Ikaris. There were other disappointments as well. The Deviants were a rather forgettable villains and the intelligent one was a wasted opportunity. The backstory of the Deviant's plan doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The combat abilities of the Eternals don't seem very impressive given their cosmic significance.It's not the worst movie in the Marvel catalogue by any means, but it's a long way from the top tier as well."
341,7,"So confused I never understand why Marvel talks about other series or movies, like Avengers. Just leave that out and make it appear as different worlds. Example X-men never interact with Avengers and Vice versus. When they do this it makes it disturbing that super hero's stood around why Thanos wiped out the earth, and a weak story line as to why did not interfere. How do you not interfere when half the galaxy is wiped out. Same with Captain Marvel, who doesn't appear to help the avengers until the last movie, seriously Nick Fury didn't think it was important to call her when the sky's opened up and Loki tried to take it over or Ultron is about to district the earth by dropping Sacovia from the sky. Also Black Panther tribe stand around why all in human acts in Africa. Just seems the writers could do a better job."
342,3,"What were they trying? This film is not good. It's not the worst film ever made or anything like that but it is not good.Marvel has a few films that are far from perfect but this one doesn't make sense, what were they trying with this film? It's boring and doesn't really fit with the other MCU movies in tone, style or anything.The casting is also a bit odd, some of it is well casted, other parts are just strange cast decisions, again, what were they trying? The film doesn't fit at all and totally wastes some excellent characters and their potential.Ultimately, it doesn't matter what the audience thinks as they will just make sequels and redos (already read they plan a sequel...) but they should really rethink doing anything further with this."
343,6,"Eternals was fine, it's the audience who is lacking. So the big complaint for audiences I think is that Eternals is boring and not as fun as other Marvel films. Probably the reason that the critics didn't like it is, well it's a Marvel film. The director's attempt to make more of an art house comic book movie does feel flat, but the cognitive dissonance is due to the nature of the director's style and the franchise she was taking on, the two are waves cancelling each other out.To say that this isn't the best Marvel film, who could disagree, but to say it's the worst and rate it so... I think that's a mere matter of inflating expectations. As the MCU goes on it will find most of the films introducing characters requiring a higher marker to please. There are only so many ways to structure an origin story in new and exciting ways.One of the things that seems to be a no-no with audiences is that this film takes itself seriously. It has the occasional obligatory Marvel type self-aware humor thrown in, sure but that has become a tired gimmick if you ask me. Marvel movies are afraid to strip away their tongue-in-cheek witicisms, like a cynical, pseudo-intellectual teenager afraid to show emotion or vulnerability. Take away the wisecracking side comments and suddenly Marvel looks more like DC (Zack Snyders Justice League is crap by the way but somehow that's rated higher on IMDb)Story wise, the Eternals' only mistake is that it doesn't lull the audience into a sense of ""this is just for fun"" for a few long hours before turning up the tonal gravity. It's true, Eternals is never really fun to watch, but then again neither is Schindler's List. So maybe what Eternals needs is to go all in with R-rated action and drama to make it more like Zack Snyder's Watchmen (His best if you ask me) but alas, Disney.Now visually this is one of Marvels best works when you discount the CGI characters. Audiences and critics tend not to care about the photography in a film, but to me that alone raises Eternals above many of those that fans adore the most. Here there are more shadows and Picasso blues to give it a beautiful melancholy. Everything is framed to allow the environment to be felt, almost like a Terrance Malick film so even if you're turned off by some of the brighter Asian/Bollywood type scenes and costumes, there's still a lot of that rugged western cinema to take in.Really, it might come down to the pan-earth diversity in the cast as the reason why some people don't like it. The people are represented here which, yes Disney is obviously pushing for more inclusive casting and culturally centered films, but unlike with the new Star Wars movies, this fits well here. Characters are spread out all over the planet... it'd be weird if all looked the same. How would you tell them apart? It doesn't fell like diversifying just for the sake of diversifying.Anyhow, certainly not the best but certainly not the worst and still worth your time to see."
344,2,"meaningless trash for the cognition deficient masses Trashy meaningless movie with a trash meaningless plot and trash meaningless story line, and trash meaningless trash without meaning.It can be watched by just scrolling over it fast at pausing at crucial parts of the story line and deducing how lackluster and meaningless and trash it is and lacking story line and ultra shallow character personalities that has no relevance to the real world or any accuracy whatsoever."
345,3,"2.5hrs of my life I'll never get back. 2hrs of watching them assemble the old band, the entire time, we knew who the turn-coat is very quickly, leading into the same old story of apocalyptic melt down, with no unique or inspiring storyline which would normal be renowned of the Mega Marvel Name. Unbelievably disappointing for young and old viewers watching."
346,10,"Hinduism and Mesopotamia mythology Eternals is a kind of movie you need some knowledge of Mesopotamian mythology and Hinduism. I am a Hindu and we believe in many gods and goddesses, and Eternals is about that myth that goes back 7000 to 8000 years and how the divine beings gave us knowledge to make progress. This was an enjoyable movie and the graphics were excellent. It was good to see Hindu gods in the ending credits, like Shiva."
347,6,"Weak history knowledge!!!!! I watched this movie carefully because I like these types of movies. And also if I can connect to the meaning and the whole purpose and philosophy of the movie, I enjoy it much more. It seems that the director because of the lack of history knowledge, she tries to combine some ancient stories together and create a nice movie out of that. For example, ""Gilgamesh"" is the name of the Persian God and as I red in ancient history and mythology, his shape and powers was much more different from the Gilgamesh character in this movie!!! Also the names of all 10 Eternals, doesn't go and match with each other. I think the director should use these types of names more carefully with more knowledge. Anyway I respect this movie and director. It's a very good action movie but not knowledgeable one. I hope she (director) makes her next movies much better."
348,1,"Atrocious This movie is painfully boring. The plot is extremely childish, like it was written exclusively for children below the age of 12. The dialogues, oh my god, as if written by a child. The only redeeming quality is the bits of humor here and there (for example Kingo and his valet), but certainly not enough to save this piece of trash. The stars who accepted to take roles in this travesty have really crapped on themselves."
349,9,"Don't trust the negative reviews this movie is amazing Honestly the only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 rating is I only use that for ones I consider essential that every person should see (think like, Schindler's List). The story line is amazing; detailed and easy to follow while still spanning such a large amount of time. The characters are amazing!! They are believable and honest. The acting is amazing; you feel the story through the screen.I cried at least a couple times.Also, the diversity! Ah!! Take that back, this is like a 9.9, for the diversity. Marvel is expanding in beautiful ways and making beautiful characters with beautiful diversity you can relate to. Subscribe to Disney+ if you have to. Buy the movie. It's worth it. I am in love.Also, this is the first time I have written a review for IMDB since I discovered it years ago. I check IMDB more than Facebook, but I haven't written a review till now because I like to read them, but all the bad reviews where stupid and I felt y'all needed to know the truth."
350,3,"Worst Movie I've Seen In A While I wasted 4 hours of my life to watch something worse than the Emoji Movie. The only comparison I can come up with is Home Alone 4.Highlights: None Lowlights: Poor acting from most characters (mostly Sprite) and overall terrible plot. I was confused the whole time and I'm still wondering why Thanos's brother is Harry Styles. Also why was there a leprechaun? Someone please help me, I've been mentally crippled by this movie."
351,1,"Stan Lee is rolling in his grave This movie is an embarrassment to Marvel movies. So many things wrong with this movie it's pointless to even rant. I would rather re-organize my closet than watch this garbage again.Also, why is Angelina Jolie even in this movie? Did they think viewers would be distracted by how trash this is by seeing her in it? Or maybe her agent called up the studios and said Angelina is looking to get into the super hero movies, because they're profitable, what have you got? (This is probably what happened). Either way, she should stay retired, she used to be great, now she's just an old walking stick with skin.AVOID THIS FILM!"
352,2,"Dumpster Fire Marvel Studios has outdone itself. A stupid, convoluted story poorly told. Terrible story tellers attempting to be amateur philosophers and failing miserably.Do not waste your time on this."
353,2,Eternal rubbish At this rate marvel can put any rubbish out and it's fan boys would lap it up. The acting was very wooden and forced. Angelina Jolie was seriously out of place in this film. Richard madden was a superman rip off and Gemma chan really didn't have the charisma. Way too long as well.
354,3,"It needed a script They spent $200m making a film.. and they didn't have a script. It does my head in when films do this. All that money spent and the story was bland, flat and meh. I'm no writer but I guarantee I could have written a similar poor script. It's that bad. No story, terrible dialogue and characters you couldn't care less for. Not bad for $200m..but hey..at least it had some pretty effects. I long for the days when studios said 'Oi director, don't make it longer than 90 minutes.' 2.5 hours of bland, cardboard drivel. Apart from that, it was ok! 4/10."
355,4,"Very unremarkable and not well thought out could have been better Not much great about the film, the group of characters never really seemed to gel and there was little chemistry in them as a group. The end of the world being the main threat was a real negative for me. Marvel has a ton more films announced as follow ups so there was never any real belief that the worst would happen.The film also took the worn out boring scifi approach of the earth survives cause humans are just different and they have hope (apparently no other species have does things) it means the aliens lose again.Not a great film and not one I'll be rewatching, it has also definitely made me lower my expectations for future Marvel projects not containing original MCU characters."
356,10,"Eternals hidden in human history! A Cosmic Saga of Love & Compassion! A cosmic adventure of ten Eternals who are stationed on Earth for many, many eons, as they are mysteriously ""hidden"" within the histories of humankind. The original journey began long ago when Arishem created a lineage of Eternals and Deviants.However, these 10 Eternals secretly embedded within Earth eventually make surprising individual and personal decisions throughout their adventure together, usually based upon the biggest human emotions of Love and Compassion. They each love differently and learn that they want different personal goals, even very different from their original ""programming"" just by being with humanity. After being with humans on Earth, some Eternals develop a different moral compass upon reflections of learned truths about their true purpose and why they were here on Earth in the first place.The Eternals are noteably surprised by the inescapable fact that many humans, although physically-flawed (compared to cosmic beings), tend to make mistakes that are prone to violence and self-destructive tendencies since the infancy of their history. On a few occasions, some of the Eternals even decide to step in to save humanity from themselves. The main reason for was probably to save the planet's population growth rate.However, as the cosmic journey develops it was these vital human ideas of Love Thy Neighbor & Compassion For Others & Sacrifice For The Greater Good that eventually saves humanity from cosmic doom. And, I'd like to believe the eternal ideas of Love/Compassion/Sacrifice saves the Eternals from their own nature, as well as begat a new wave of emotional intelligence for these pre-programmed cosmic beings. Can love eventually save the universe from cosmic hopelessness? Well, this is Part One so let's hope we continue this MCU story further on and I for one hopes there are more adventures to tell along the way... Long live Jack ""The King of Comics"" Kirby!! (This film was heavily based on Jack Kirby's cosmic creation and also included some of Neil Gaiman's Eternals run in 2006.)P. S. - One of the most amazing aspects of this fantastical film is the ensemble cast is soooo representative of human diversity. It truly is THE MOST DIVERSE ensemble cast of actors, performers and cultural human beings. And led by a independent filmmaker on a mega-budget Hollywood production with endless real locations (very few studio sets). You can watch some wonderful Behind The Scenes and insider insights from Marvel Studios Assembled; Season 1 Episode 8: The Making of The Eternals."
357,6,"Mess! It felt Souless, the action scenes were awesome and the final half too the whole icarus turning moment from then on it was engaging but the entire movie felt dragged and it felt hard to watch, the cultures were amazingly showcased, the kit-harington and karun's character were awesome to watch others were decent the stories is overall a mess although starting and ending's decent and the post credits were awesome, still a dissapointing Movie!"
358,1,What happened? The score and action sequences were good. Also I like some of the directors work. Only downside was that this should have been two separate films. It would have been better if the movie was set in the past and leads up to them breaking up the band. Then the sequel would have picked up where it left off. Wouldn't be the first time Disney/Marvel has done it. Got to slow down on this stuff barely keeping up with all the shows. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.
359,3,"Not every director ... ... has the quality to write and direct a superhero movie and that is the main problem. The overall story is quit interesting but there is no thrill in the storytelling. The very slow cutting, I.e. The most boring Bollywood dance cinematographic I ever see. Even the character building maybe is now one the cutting room floor."
360,2,"Disney Marvels are so boring I do not know what Disney is thinking, but all recent Disney Marvel productions are plain bad. It seems only Sony Marvels have something going for them. Eternals is way too long, way too pretentious and without anything remotely interesting in storytelling. Just skip the Disney Marvels."
361,2,Oh dear Sad & desperate references to Avengers added to dreadful premise and totally derivative plot add to boredom.Good cast is the only redemption.Why Angelina?? Do you need the money?I'm poorer and none the wiser UK.
362,5,It was Literally eternals It had good actors and it wasn't that horrible but it was just boring and hard to connect but still watchable. It felt very long because it was so boring. But it's just my opinion..
363,2,Poor film The whole Storyline was lacking along with the acting. It felt like they were trying to get too many new characters in without good storytelling.Marvel peaked with Infinity War and Endgame and I was hoping that this would pick up the torch but I was wrong.
364,4,"Poorly written story Week story, full of plot holes and several clichés. Some things don't catch up with the story later. In one moment, it's said they shouldn't influence humanity, another moment, they are doing exactly that. The monsters don't have a reason to exist in the movie and they are just a scapegoat. The Eternals themselves are boring and a wood-face acting.There were only two interesting things in the movie. The first, is the Pink Floyd songs in the movie; and the second is the voyage through historical moments in history that don't get much spotlight, such as the fall of Tenochtitlan.But, besides this, the movie is just garbage."
365,3,"Visuals and sound and that's it Visuals and sound are great. Movie was literally boring. Only reason I continued to watch was to see the end because a friend said ""at least the end was ok"". Other family members bailed after first hour."
366,8,Ignore the criticism This had guardians of the galaxy vibes all over it. Mostly because it's a lesser known side of marvel but regardless of the hate it's overall a good film. With good cgi. Good characters and a good story that's like any new entry into the mcu a building block for future stories.
367,5,S'boring It could have just been a disney+ mini series. Took me 3 tries to finish it. CGI is cool but not enough to save it its just made to fill in plot in other movies.
368,4,"One of the most confusing... The fact that someone mentions it was a choice to do special Effects with little green screen is easily shown in the film making the effects themselves too basic. The other fact that there were so many characters is simply confusing. The process to bring in various backgrounds/accents is not cohesive because it feels too forced (if background is given such as these two are related, those three grew up together, these 2 have fought side by side, etc it makes the group stronger and to tell any such story it should start with how these characters met and stayed together not just some sparkly ball lit up Selma's character like ""game on"").The initial start of test scrolling up was simply boring. Why not have any of the externals characters say it as it passes? What test audience checked this was interesting?Anytime a story is told out of order it is always confusing. When it's done effectively it is only when there is too much info needed, but it's like telling the big parts in order and then going back to fill in details (like watch a movie and then watch behind the scenes).This movie should have been an outright blast but most of it is disappointing or distracting (the deviants are literally the transformer dinosaurs, Icarus is Superman and X-men cyclops, the simple effects with big action fight movements, etc). This never felt like a movie but a mishmash of other movies, things you've seen and it's been done before, and talk of other marvel characters and plot lines. How did this pass any test audience let alone (I assume) a few of them? Conceptually it should have been a massive Project broken down into tasty pieces and yet the audience is always wanting more.I'm Going to watch this again soon and try and figure out what I'm missing. Do what you do and check it out twice."
369,3,Uninteresting and unconvincing The same reasons that made the Justice League film a wandering and broken story seems to be the common trend with this film. Some great green screen visuals and effects though. (Shrugs shoulders)
370,7,"More Like 7.5 Stars Rating I just watched it and it isn't a bad movie. Special effects were on point. Storyline was interesting enough and kept my attention. Acting and cast were not bad choices either. I just don't know if Chloe Zhao was a right fit for this genre though. But under the tutelage of, as I call him now General Feige, I'm starting to feel the same magic I once felt in the previous Marvel films phase 1 through 3.Now we are smack dab in the thick of phase 4 and it still works believe it or not. The clues each movie leaves behind after the credits end, it's sort of like the calm before the 2nd big storm and General Feige is brewing something massive again like he did in Endgame.Honestly, I can't wait to see what the next chapter of phase 4 will be about. It has definitely sparked my interest again."
371,2,"Shallow. Pretentious. Lame I watched the whole thing but I wanted to turn it off in the first 45 min ish. I'm a big marvel fan. This is by far the worst movie. The character names. Lame. The acting. Dull. The ""bad guys"" were silly. The concept recycled upon recycled. Movie length, beyond too long. It gets 2 stars and not one bc there were a few laughs and fewer truly decent moments. I am not better off from watching. It adds nothing. They should be embarrassed for releasing this. Horrible job all around."
372,6,Better than I thought Slow going and in and out of time slotsDecent casting but feels clunky as it tells its taleDecent twist as wellHowever the slow pace is what costs this movie there is so much it didn't need to have.The mid credits scene is just weird and doesn't fill me with hope for the future of the mcu.
373,4,"Another Meh movie It's another Marvel move with lots, and lots of beautiful effects, storyline is boring!These moves have weak narratives, so they rely on the visuals and effects to drive the plot.My wife and I was bored all though the movie, we did not have any expectations, when we watched, that often makes a movie worse.But it did not help this movie either."
374,6,"Feels like a DC movie It's just ok. The story is potentially very good but unfortunately there is no character development, the acting is wooden at best and the direction is poor."
375,1,"What a load of codswallop Absolutely terrible. Full of cliches, tries at humour (badly!) but at least they've ticked the minorities boxes.Superhero's who can't simply just kill something they have to keep fighting and stabbing or shooting it for God knows how long.Storyline is bad and I feel sorry for the actors and what was even the point of Angelina Jolie? Or the elf one. Infact, they're all pretty lame."
376,5,Boring and disappointing The first hour of the movie was pretty interesting with the introduction of the characters. The rest was a big disappointment and not what I expected to see. Marvel shouldn't bother releasing a movie for them. Especially in that tone.
377,5,"golden lights effect all over Boring movie .unnatractive acting. Another Superhero movie lacking depth,complex characterization , or pulling in suspence.Uninspired Direction and story.Special effects and monsters cgi are sub part.Not Recommended ."
378,3,Disgusting and dull This movie is so incredibly slow and uninteresting. Nothing happens but dumb conversation which guides through a tournament of stupid inclusive pc crap.What remains is a big fat EWWWW!!
379,4,"Poor excuse for a MCU movie Toss in a couple mentions of Thanos & now it can be part of the MCU? That's what this film tries to pull.The movie wasn't great, but had the film been not been tied to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I would have been more lenient in my rating.The characters are unknown, the story is unfamiliar, it's only relationship to other Marvel movies is they briefly talk about Thanos & his wiping out half of all life. There are action scenes too. Remove all mention of Thanos & company & the movie would survive, especially because the mention of it sounds contrived.To avoid spoilers, I won't elaborate more."
380,3,When marvel tries to make a DC film Eternals make no sense in the mcu. It's dark. It creates a narrative of that makes no sense in a universe that had the thanos snap. We barely get to know them and they are as superficial as the dc heroes.Don't waste your time it's just depressing.
381,3,"Visual FX on point in a bad movie Diversity. That's the mandatory trend in Hollywood nowadays. And this movie has it all: black people, gay people, deaf people, actors with different English accents... Everyone is an eternal. Add that to terrible puns, laim acting and a boring and bland writing and that is all Marvel has to give us now.I blame myself for still giving it a try but the fact is I'll miss those 2,5 hours of my life."
382,1,Garbage Without doubt the worst marvel movie. Story was so dull no villain no chemistry among characters. Even eternals as a team sucked. What's worst is that the director and actors instead of accepting that their movie was just not good are coming up with lame excuses to blame it on audience's. Pathetic.
383,1,"Focus was elsewhere The preview looked somewhat promising though I had my doubts.The movie drags on at a slow place. The VFX were average though not that bad. For those who can see the lobbies who fund and/or influence these movies, it must be apparent that there was more focus on being inclusive of 1) Some set of minorities and 2) Women. This is not problematic and earlier Marvel movies have done this very well: Meaning-that the being inclusive part did not spoil the plot not did unnecessary garbage get included under the name of being inclusive.However, Chloe Zhao the Chinese film maker either independently or under the influence of CCP or related lobbies, it seems, spent unnecessary time and effort in portraying a people of certain nation/race, who sent the CCP into a shock by bloodying China's face in a border skirmish, in poor light. Perhaps the film would have come out a little better if the focus was on the presentation of the film rather than racial stereo-typing."
384,2,"Worst Marvel ever Boring boring boring. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Characters are terrible, post credit scenes are boring, I have no words to express how much I have having lost two and a half hour of my life watching this."
385,4,"Watching people who mostly can't die (eternals) fight each other can be boring This review has been declined 3 times now. I don't know why, I think it's cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.The whole film was pretty flat, John Snow turned up and said some funny lines, and Gemma Chan was lovely to look at, but there sure was a lot of cheese in this vegan meal of a film. Some terrible 'inspirational' life messages delivered direct to camera that made you cringe with their rhetoric.It played like it was constructed from a ""making big budget films for dummies"" book, and they left it at pretty much the bullet points list on the inside cover.Shoehorn in a Diversity cast that differed greatly from the source material. I do like to see diversity on screen but sometimes it appears over zealous, like this film and comes across as forced and token and works against the world of the film. The Eternals are not from earth at all so no need to tick all the diversity check boxes. Quite the opposite, they should appear with no cultural links at all. They also shoe horned in a sign language eternal, which just made no sense in the world of the Eternals, Why would the massively powerful universe creators create an eternal who couldn't hear or speak and needed to use their hands to communicate? The original comics had Makkari as a Male who has a relationship with Sersi, in fact many of the original Eternals are male. I'm all for positive representations on a diverse society, but this casting choice just came across as weird as far as the film's story was concerned.Slot in an ex boy band debut as an actor - Check!My eyes rolled back into my head when that happened. Big budget movie making by the numbers.I don't know quite where the problem was. Chloé Zhao's direction by committee choices? It wasn't all bad, there was some decent acting, particularly Barry Keoghan who's character seemed complex, but,... even so it was roped in and never went anywhere. Gilgamesh also was good, until he was dispatched easily.Then they started fighting each other, and they're Eternals and can't die, except when it's convenient to move the plot along. It got boring really quickly."
386,9,"So much better than most Marvel popcorn flix OK this was a thought-provoking drama that happened to be under the sci-fi banner. Unlike most every Marvel flick which has been more like cotton candy - sweet, no substance - this nicely laid out, enjoyably long movie approaches a level of serious credibility at lest compared to the existing remainder of the MCU which, after all, is inspired by of all things, the vapidity of comic books.No details here, only one suggestion: take my 9 stars and knock off 2 for a bit of real world comparison to other enjoyable origin stories for humanity. Those extra 2 stars were to set this review apart from all the nasty Marvelites who felt ""out of touch"" 🤣.Quite the opposite reaction for me. Hey - don't get me wrong; I'll watch any Marvel franchise product just for fun. It's just that I was very happily surprised by this one's depth in combination with Marvel's excellent SFX and production values. Closest in emotional range perhaps to the first Wonder Woman's revelations without the manipulative soundtrack and goofy human/goddess attraction."
387,4,"Worst marvel movie I had to watch it thrice just to understand why ikris killing his own team members. Hard to connect, hard to understand. Slow pace. No emotional connection. It doesn't give feeling of marvel."
388,8,"Solid, enjoyable movie Not every movie requires constant fighting and explosions to be entertaining. I felt that The Eternals had a decent mixture of excitement and interesting dialogue with a few moments of humor mixed in nicely. I also felt that the actors did a good job. The plot brought up a thought provoking scenario that was more than the normal ""good guy vs bad guy"" situation. I look forward to additional movies in the series. As well as a possible spin off from another character??"
389,1,"Worst Marvel film This has got to be the worst film I've seen in a long time. The acting was terrible, there was absolutely no storyline. I can't believe Marvel released such a bad film."
390,5,"A species older than the Earth and yet English is the base language I know it's a bit peaky to pick up on such details, after all tons of movies do this dumb decision of alien beings or ancient entities speak perfect English as their native language, I am aware this is Hollywood and it wouldn't appeal for part of the audience I guess, but can we get pass it? Because it is ridiculous... Or at least find some far-fetched explanation for it, or even maybe an approach like the Viking series (when 2 people are speaking the same language they just put it in English, but when foreigners talk among each other you hear their original tongue).Anyway, let's get into the movie, I know the multiverse brings a bunch of new possibilities but how many higher entities are we suppose to be on the lookout these days, and which one have the higher power? First Kan in Loki, then the Watcher in What If, the multiverse and now Celestials and Eternals...? I mean I know it's fantasy and that their doing a good job in some of the projects that bring together these heroes, but isn't there a limit..?The movie is way too long for the story it tells, it's as any other Marvel movie, predictable and even though it feels too long it is not built in a way where you feel attachment for the characters.All of them are highly uncharismatic, they are suppose to be wise millennial beings but they behave as humans with the age of their respective actors, the fact that they have all these thousands of years of life doesn't seem any different of an adult in its 30s or 40s... Sure as you would expect you have some fun action sequences and stunning visuals, I mean I won't give a lower score mostly for that, and for that subconscious curiosity that Marvel puts us in with their foreshadowing and post-credit scenes.You won't miss a thing if you don't watch it, for now at least it stands on its own and feel very irrelevant in all honesty."
391,5,"A MCU entry worst than Captain Marvel I thought Disney was unable to deliver a movie worst than Captain Marvel and Thor the Dark Elves, but they did it.The plot is boring. Despite the gran scale, the stakes are lower than the first Iron Man. A History Channel documentary is more exciting. The idea of celebrating human culture is noble, but it's not enough to carry a 3 hours movie.The characters are boring. Having a diverse cast doesn't make your movie any good. Before anything, you must have a compelling story and interesting characters.The villain? You have three antagonists: deviants, superman and the red-CGI-monstrosity. But none work. We're back to the old days of MCU villain problem. Just to have an idea of how bad the villains are, the elf from Thor the Dark Portal is more intimidating."
392,9,"Great new approach on heroes I think the movie is refreshing compared to the classic MCU movies. It points more to the struggles of being a hero. It visualises the trolley problem and doesnt justify killing, as other superhero-movies do. While other heroes tend to kill the ""bad guy"" without thinking twice, I loved that this movie showed that this is never and should never be an easy decision to kill a sentient being."
393,9,"A human experience Everyone is a critic.I quite enjoyed the movie. Not your typical ""super hero"" flick. I love the diversity of it all. I really enjoyed how it shows what it means to be human and not what it means to be a superhero. I felt a wide range of emotions while watching Eternals. It definitely took me on a mental and emotional journey. Most people try to be critic on here with their narrow view and closed mind."
394,10,"Not Bad I like the history and how they helped the evolution, I think there's more mystery to this movie..hopefully they'll get a green light for a sequel, you have to be open-minded to fully get this movie..."
395,3,"Yawnfest Not original or particularly entertaining.I gave up after an hour or so as it was pretty uninteresting and formulaic. Nothing new or special, just another boring long unending superhero movie, like we havn't had enough already."
396,8,"Not bad Honestly aside from the mild kisses scene and the critical reviews, I liked it. I liked how are they the wrong people, or the good guys? Or just soldiers doing what they've been told to do. Nowadays you see someone like Thanos you think he's a bad guy, but in reality he's not bad nor good. This is the same in Captain America civil war, Yes they're heroes, but in return they destroyed houses, people died and they didn't even notice it, so what does that make them?There's nothing called Who's bad or good nowadays, and this is something I like."
397,4,"Another miss for Marvel It's a great cast, and the story deals with some very deep questions towards humanity. Unfortunately whoever is running this show don't know what they're doing! There is a serious problem with the rhythm of the movie. Could've easily cuts half an hour out of the movie. Character expositions fail to make me care about anything. All you're left with is a lot of CGI. I remember at the climax thinking to myself "" that's a lot of CGI"" while realizing how little I cared. Another miss for Marvel."
398,8,"Quite enjoyable Despite hearing mixed reviews, we decided to watch it and glad we did. It was a great action-packed watch, tad too long but understandable as they had to spend time setting up. The ensemble cast is a joy to watch, especially Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek."
399,6,"Just boring ... I wanted to watch this movie in the cinema but I didn't find time for it.... Fortunately like I found out 😅🙈Despite great actors the story could not catch my attention... after 20 minutes I already stopped and when I continued later I grabbed my cell phone after some minutes which I normally don't do while watching good movies... But hell, it's so boring !The story, the characters ...nothing touched me 😩I really felt relief when the really long long movie was over 😪"
400,5,"Watch if you are bored First off, this movie could have been chopped down by one hour. The character development clearly doesn't work as I was left feeling nothing for any of the characters as they came into danger.It has some pretty locales and the monsters are pretty interesting to look at.The only thing that I really liked was the soundtrack."
401,1,"Immortality? These so-called Eternals who were tagged as immortals were still died one after another. So what's going on? They didn't die since 7,000 BC, yet they kept dying when closer to modern days. Well, anyway, we just couldn't get connected with this lousy sci-fi movie and couldn't care less than those anti-vaxx people who chose to take chance during this uncertain pandemic era. We've tried very hard with patience to see if this movie really getting somewhere and telling something interesting. But sadly, after we finally have reached in the middle of it, we all decided to quit. It's such a boring and ridiculous production. Not just completely wasted lot of money and talents, but also our lifetime. Are we having enough of the Sci-fi movies, the CGI computerized special effects? The ridiculousness? Since when Hollywood has to find stories from the comic books like the Japanese did? Why we choose to watch animated movies instead of those ones with real persons? Could we ever grow out of such weird obsessions?This is one of the worst movies we've seen so far. Some of them were so bad, but we still could finish them, but this one, we just lost our interest almost from the first 5 minutes, and to hang along to the middle of it was just a clueless miracle.Chole Chao, you shouldn't waste your talent on this Marvel garbage."
402,7,"Unmet forces Early in the first frames you can tell something is off. The editing, the characters, the actors, there are endless missed marks and odd time signatures.I did not think the concept behind the film were wrong but it ended feeling like one of these picture you have to re-edit in your head to start to really enjoy; have a touch of blue brush here and there to appreciate it.I believe that Chloé Zhao really made something special and that the Eternals made perfect sense in the end, that ""it could have been"" an amazing piece of cinema - and sometimes it is - but there are two intelligences at work here. One is Marvel, one is Zhao. And they don't meet. The constant irony, the constant need to have action sequences, the importance for characters to have humour and defy expectations, and Zhao's many attempts at changing the angle of Marvel movies, are constantly eliminating their effects. Sometimes you wonder how is that possible that actors played so unclearly very simple things.There are things to rejoice but they are pieces of a puzzle to redo in your own mind.Strangely, I liked it. Probably because it was so different and that I'm engaged in Marvel by now. Probably because I liked what's behind it, the mythos, the way Eternals are just stupid machines (that was truly unexpected). Sometimes, I really loved the special effects (the runner Eternal), Angelina Jolie's performance in general, the way the camera is steady on action, many of the attempts. What misses is Marvel ability to always engage and find the right way to do their thing.All in all, I don't mind, I learned somethings but this is probably not a very good film."
403,2,"Super burned out I'm tired of the same mess. Which is why no hero movie will get another dollar out of me. Eternals is trash that can barely pass as eye candy. Good for background noise, but my god, I cannot get over how convoluted yet meadnering it is. I could feel my brain cells dying off.Also, in live action, please stop writing children to play adults in a child's body. It never works. They are never convincing and if they are, its because the audience has lost all their brain cells and now rely solely on motor functions."
404,7,"Should've been two films. Eternals is not a bad film. Nor a great one. It's a decent film, which felt very rushed. The character development time was too short, especially given that these are all new characters being introduced. There could have been so much dept and feel to each character, that chance was squandered because they tried to squeeze in so much materials into one film. That said, this should've been two films. Part 1 to tell the story and build the characters background. Could've been their arrival and entire past, which as only shown as a glimpse on Eternals. Part 2, to continue the story from the present time, and carry on where it ended. Just imagine if Part 1 ended with a cliffhanger of Ikaris pushing Ajak off the mountain! Missed opportunity. Hopefully they will continue the story ark, and not try to squeeze in 3 movies into one. Great visuals. Great fight scenes. Short but decent comedy. Acting was top notch. Direction was good too. 7/10."
405,4,Worst from marvel... Eternals is nothing but a exact same copied sample story of Fantastic four ...rise of silver surfer movie...nothing but expect where in eternals villain is Celestial in fantastic four its galactus..Dramas over...only fighting against cgi characters to run d movie length..Characters involved in tis movie is already d same version from fantastic four movie wit some superpowers added..Not a bit worthy by marvel..
406,5,"A big misfire. I couldn't figure out who this film was meant for.I'm a big fan of the old Chinese fantasy movies, and in a lot of ways The Eternals reminded me of films like Zu, Warriors of the Magic Mountain, but without the brashness or the charm. When my mind drifted, as it did quite often during this picture, I found myself wishing Tsui Hark worked for Disney.I'm also a massive fan of Jack Kirby; I have been ever since I bought my first Marvel comic in 1964. His art was huge, the characters jumped off the page at you, when they clashed you could feel the ground shake. His imagination was boundless. The Fantastic Four films - all of them - failed because they couldn't translate his vision to the screen. The same applies with the Eternals. There was a unique opportunity here to turn a grand comic book series into an epic. The human characters Kirby embedded in the narrative would have been great fun to develop, and they would have anchored the narrative and made it more relatable.Writing wasn't Kirby's strong point, but a team of highly paid writers ought to have been able to take the exciting raw material, give it better structure, bring it a little more down to earth, and turn it into a film worth the ticket money. The best Marvel films have always been the films truest to the source material, but updated to the present day. This one misfired."
407,2,"Marvel's Missed Opportunities There is so much wrong with this film. I'm cool with a longer runtime for a movie if it's really good, this movie plays out like a long bad jazz solo, you just want it to end already. The beginning of the movie showed some promise because I got the vibe that Cerce's (Gemma Chan) boyfriend played by Kit Harrington would keep her grounded and be a fun partnership throughout the movie, but that's not the movie we got. Instead this movie is about 20% action, 80's exposition dumps.The biggest problem of this film is it's trying to fit 7,000+ years of lore and character building in less than three hours of time and is trusting you, the viewer, to roll with it.As far as characterization, we get the most out of characters we don't like, and very little of the characters we want. I want to applaud the filmmakers on going against convention and not bringing Kingo back for the final battle but I think the set up and payoff is convention for a reason. The Ikaris and Cerce characters are about as exciting as watching paint dry and have zero chemistry. I want to care about the plight of Angelina Jolie's character, but again, there is so little character development and too much lore for the audience to take in in such a short time. The deviants are treated as simply a plot device, and I dare say an afterthought throughout the movie, making the stakes feel really low and the climax underwhelming.This movie should have been a series, and even then, I doubt very much it would be better with the scattershot storytelling the filmmakers used with it. My prediction is the Eternals will become like the Hulk and not get any more films, but rather become supporting characters in other marvel films. This was just not good, at all. You can tell there are alot of people giving glowing reviews who want to like it but give off the vibe that they refuse to say a marvel movie is bad. I can say with certainty that this is my least favorite Marvel movie, it makes Iron Man 3 look like a masterpiece."
408,3,Watch on your risk It's try to good movie but without good script and act its not worthy.Don't waste your time.Bad trip to watching such headless And mindless movie.
409,2,"MARVEL MCU is going downhill, FAST! This is not a movie! This is another marketing product carefully crafted for political, gender, racial and so on... correctness. Don't get me wrong, I'm not about offending people, but when everything revolves around some marketing checkboxes, the end result is pathetic. This movie has absolutely NO character! I feel sorry for the cast. For me, as a long time MARVEL fan, this movie is not even worth watching. I've watched it a couple of days ago and I can barely remember anything. It's a shame."
410,4,"They should've waited Like most people, my excitement for this movie was not where it usually was for a Marvel movie mainly because I had no idea who the Eternals were and it was completely overshadowed by the release of Spiderman the next month. And yes I wasn't really too excited for Shang Chi either for similar reasons, but that still managed to be a big hit with me and audiences so it is in the realm of possiblity for this to be good. It's the first MCU film that I didn't go to watch in theaters and that was probably the wise decision. Introducing all these characters while trying to tell a story had to be challenging in a 2.5 hour crunch, but because of that, each one of them was already bland on arrival, there is a lot of info thrown at you that you're forced to keep up with, and some moments really had me scratching my head with a few causing me to laugh out loud when that wasn't the intent. There are some really interesting ideas that are introduced as well, mainly with the villain, but there's never enough time devoted to that and the movie kind of brushes it off to the side which was really disappointing. I can appreciate how Chloe Zhao wanted to do this movie in a non traditional fashion, but to me there wasn't enough to stay invested. I really believe that if this had been a Disney+ mini series, it could've been a lot better with developing more connections with the characters, understanding more of the history, and having some epic Marvel action to top it off. It is what it is and I'm not sure if it's a film that I'd want to come back and rewatch anytime soon."
411,3,"Watching your house burn down is more enjoyable. This was such a mess. Few questions: why does someone speak American Sign Language 7000 years before America? If humans hadn't evolved yet, why do they look like us? Surely they'd be modelled on Celestials? Why is every character suddenly super powerful when the plot requires? But will fall down and not be able to get up from a single punch at any other time in the movie...? I could go on and on. Great cast. Special effects were less than the usual Marvel standard. Messy script. Disjointed direction. I agree with a lot of the comments saying this could have made a good series on Disney+"
412,3,"Hayek and Madden are dull and disappointing Eternals struggles to deliver. I was blown away with how poorly Richard Madden performed as a lead in this film after enjoying him in GOT. I'm also sorry to say I can no longer stand Salma Hayak, after years of crushing on her as a teenage boy. Action and visuals are superb, but one of those films where no matter how hard people get hit they seem to be fine."
413,8,"Different? I feel like with this film, they tried to create ""A Marvel Bible"" with the start of the movie saying ""In The Beginning"". In the Opening of the movie, there is an amazingly shot and directed sequence of Eternals Action which was pretty good to be fair as it was shot in a pandemic, it is a marvel movie after all. The action and the CGI remain excellent throughout the film, the story of the film seemed purposely ""Divine"". I see the goal that this movie was going for and well they did it brilliantly... (By the Way, there is a sex scene in this... so Yeah, take that as you will) Spoiler!!Every Character is not that detailed like in other Marvel Movies... Gilgamesh has a thing for Thena but they do tell us anything about that for he takes the Guardianship of Thena, and I also Feel like Ajak is not a Character that you get rid of in the first movie... Maybe she will come back, who knows ""its marvel"" What I Really Think About this film is that it is ""A hurry Film"" meaning that it was not given the story wise attention, which made the movie a lot to take at once.I Mean Still the movie is great but if you watch this movie alone you are not going to enjoy it but with friends you might even rate the movie A Big ""8"".And If You haven't watched the rest of the Marvel movies in the order you might not like this soo go watch that before you have a Different ""but divine"" Experience."
414,3,"A few good moments, otherwise a major disappointment. I didn't care for most of the casting or special effects, I didn't like the dialogue at all, and everything was painfully contrived. This movie checked just about all the wrong boxes for me.I'm a long-time fan of Jack Kirby and am quite familiar with his source material. His solo writing was as awful as his art was spectacular (that's precisely why his collaborations with Stan Lee writing were far more successful,) but there was no reason to translate such wooden, inept dialogue to the screen. There was zero chemistry among the meticulously diverse cast, though, so perhaps that's also to blame.About the only thing I liked was the depiction of the Celestials, although they were almost entirely wasted in this lackluster film. I'd love to see what Denis Villeneuve could do with creatures of such an epic scale."
415,9,"Loved watching the movie I really don't understand all the bad reviews given to that movie. I loved every bit of it, it's true that it's slow paced, but, it gives you time to understand each character. Moreover, great action, great acting ..."
416,6,"Too much of everything, but too far from Marvel I love Seems like they wanted to amaze an overamazed audience--and overdone it. The core story is pretty simple, but there are so many unnecessary details and events that the credits were appreciated very much: at last it was over and we could go. And yes, despite the movie is about universal events, humanity barely noticed anything. Just noted that humongous cadaver sticking out of water--meh, nothing big here, folks, now back to ""America's got talent"".I don't recognize Marvel. Their movies used to be so light and simple, and yet very entertaining. But ""Eternals"" looks like it was made by a completely different studio. It doesn't even feel like a part of Marvel Universe. Too heavy, too dramatic. The jokes are so rare, that it made them too precious, but too weak to save the whole thing.I can't say I didn't like the movie. But it's not Marvel I love. It's like I got back to the X-Men era, but now they are not mutants, but eternals. I wasn't amazed, unfortunately, though I liked the cast.And... Stark, Nat, Cap--they're gone (as Banner and Barton, I suppose), and their places are still vacant as for me. I can't name anyone from new superheros who would be as cool as the old guard."
417,4,"Boring..... I have to say I went into this looking forward to seeing what they did. Within 10 minutes I was bored. Casting choices were strange and seem to be done to tick boxes. Gemma Chan is not a leading lady and literally had one facial expression throughput the whole film. Also, what really annoyed me was they all had different accents. If they are aliens sent from space how can they have Scottish and Irish accents? Weird. Almost as annoying was the fact that at the end after they stopped tiabet they did not think there would be consequences and went on about there merry ways living amongst the people on earth.The visuals were good buy not enough to save it."
418,2,"No redeeming qualities other than diversity I find it sad that Marvel has lost their touch after Endgame. The writing was on the wall with Captain Marvel but I never thought that they would go as shallow as the Eternals. This movie, for some reason, introduces ton of new characters and lore that no one heard of or even cared about. The first 10 minutes sets the tone of the movie. It can't connect with the audience and never explains who does what and why. Half the time you can't even remember the character names. In the third act when they were talking about Ajak, we were looking each other ""Which one was Ajak? Oh, Selma Hayek... Ok..."" That's never a good sign. In the end, we assigned nicknames to the characters, the fat one, the black-girl, the child, Dinesh, Angelina, weirdo, etc. Special effects were Marvel quality but they tried to follow the Transformers route in that, multiple CGI characters collide with each other and you have no idea what is going on. Oh and finally, the story has so many blatant plot-holes, half way through the movie, you have to shut down that part of your brain in order to continue watching. Final score: 2/10 and I'm being generous."
419,7,"Eternals Visually very good, the story does drag a bit at times. Not my favorite Marvel movie ever made, but was entertaining throughout. Worth the time watching though a few breaks mixed in would be recommended."
420,9,One of my favorite Marvel movies I loved this movie all the characters had a great back story and I love Angelina Jolie. It was very thrilling and exciting to watch!!! I think this is a 9 star movie for me I watched it more so many times.
421,1,"If you gave this a 10, you are out of your damn mind... This is without a doubt the worst movie from the Marvel universe so far, yes worse than Hulk. Dreadful CGI, dreadful, emotionless acting, bad actor choices, absolute lack of synergy between them. Just...ugh."
422,1,"A B movie with high budget Great expectations totally vaporized by every single aspect of this ""movie"".No historical reference poor acting and performance of immortal beings and gods.A vision of divinity as medium range humans with poor intellect and driven by teen emotions.Unreal in every aspect including family which as an only example has two fathers with an adopted son."
423,6,"Missed opportunity There are some interesting concepts in the film that had good potential. There are many different ideas crammed in, but the film is trying to do too much and not succeeding at any one of them particularly well.The main characters are well cast and I did find I was intrigued by them, but unfortunately none of them are really fleshed out enough and I didn't feel fully invested in them or the story.There were also some pacing issues, around the mid point of the film there was a huge exposition dump lasting at least 30 mins that made the film really drag.I thought this would have been perfect as a disney + series rather than a film as each episode could have focussed on each one of the eternals individually and then a team up for the final few episodes.Credit where it was due, there are some excellent visuals in this film, I watched it at home on a 4k tv and in imax format some of the scenes are stunning."
424,1,"Don't bother This movie is just terrible. The plot is bad, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, the cast is bad, the effects are bad.It's a pointless movie that never need be made.I could only get through 10 minutes and had to turn it off from my brain melting from inane stupidity. Please makers, take this movie and put it in the trash with others like, it ie suicide squad, guardian of the galaxy 2, and birds of prey."
425,1,"Trash Hollywood is struggling hard to engage its audience, or is it? That's the question. Lazy and sloppy productions like this one should never be made, but Hollywood keeps making them, and I wonder why.Recognized and realized early on that this was trash, so I turned it off making sure I didn't spend more of my time on it."
426,8,"It's not as bad as most are saying I'll admit the story is a bit lacking,but the visuals and the characters are great... I love Angelina in anything,she doesn't disappoint... Justice league knock off but I'll let it slide..."
427,4,"Disappointing... only the visuals are great and that's about it. It would've been nice if their original language was something other than English and they used it more frequently to make this movie more realistic. This is just a doggy way to make it comfortable for us.I never thought I would say this for a marvel movie, but the acting is so so bad... I never expected this from a marvel movie, feels like the actors don't even know how to act out the character. The only thing good about this movie was the visual and sound effects.The gave the most veteran character of the movie a handicap... WTH. TBH one of the reason I watched this movie was for AJ, and she's like a broken weapon. What is she even doing in the marvel universe? Such a waste of character.So in all this mumbo jumbo, we find that these advanced beings (robots) are just another form of bunch of humans? These so called ""eternals"" are supposed to be the best, yet they're just so much like humans in terms of emotional drama.I was expecting them to behave differently... yet the more I saw them the more they looked and behaved like human which makes the whole point of them being from different planet and being different species (even if they're robots) meaningless.The plot of the movie was such a mess and hard to follow, the whole thing TBH feels so weird.Something was seriously lacking.Anyway, you be the judge of this movie and decide."
428,2,"Waste of time and energy Marvel people usually handle thier heroes pretty good. Rarely they fail to deliver and this is one of that rare instances. When I saw the trailer the first time it looked really promising but honestly the trailer was much better than the movie itself.First of all, the movie is one of the slowest paced movies I have ever seen. Hey this is a super hero movie so it has to be full of action, driving, catchy scenes right? Sadly no. It's boring and lots of flashbacks.. Maningless discussions and conversations. Boring acting and really boring super hero movie!It's actually so boring that I had to turn it off twice and come back later to finish the movie just because I don't like to quite things and I had hope that maybe it would start picking up but it never did.Usually I love Marvel's approach to making super hero movies but this time they failed big time. I can see why critics loved this movie. Whhenever critcs love and cherish a movie I stay away and this time I failed to do that and it cost me 2 hrs of my life!"
429,1,"Zero 0000000000 This is the worst marvel movie ever! The story has no logic, couldn't wait for it to be over.Why would they make something like this, please tell me?It's really ashame to see movies reach to this, no morals, no heart, just empty, so very sad!And why you guys had to push that in the show with those two guys? Even more sad!!!A world without GOD is a sad world indeed."
430,1,"Bad movie Movie was trash and would not advise anyone to watch it, just horrible and obscene. Also not for children. I see they removed bad comments to make the movie seem better than it is, so sad."
431,7,There are worse MCU fims imo Not many but there are definitely worse MCU films. I enjoyed it but can kind of understand the hate in way but it is really not bad at all. I'd watch a sequel if they made one.
432,3,"Stuff moving and exploding This film looks (very) expensive. Some of the actors are quite good in the smaller scenes.But when you are presenting us with such a nonsensical plot, you can at least make sure that you get Johnny Depp in it running around and waving his arms while yelling. Clearly Angelina Jolie is not an adequate substitute.We are presented with references to old mythology. Mostly Greek, but with a wider interpretation. Sometime fun, mostly just blatantly offensive.A diverse cast should not be a problem, but confuses whatever story there is. Yet apparently they are all robots created before Earth had any awareness of races, so it's fine I guess?And then more stuff explodes..."
433,10,"all these years we were watching over humans... All these years we were watching over humans...Like Chutiya.We could have done something better than fighting off robot like dinosaurs.When they gained consciousness they figured out all these years they were also fighting like...Chutiya.When 2 chutiya teams keep fighting for nothing they decided... lets fight each other.And then they were told by someone, Bhencho tumhara to pahle hi kat gaya ... chutiya.Keep it up, we are born to be Chutia."
434,6,"Very decent but had it all to be better So the overall rating is about right a 6.5, but could of been about 7.5-8. Did very well overall to say it's new and going to be a new area of franchise I would assume, CGI was very well done and fights scenes were top notch. Downsides went on for too long and annoyingly tried to make it too deep when they could of been abit lazier and it been a better watch. Overall I say give it a watch!"
435,1,first Marvel movie I have stopped watching Even the Star power couldn't carry this lack of storyline. I felt like maybe it should have been a series so more could have been explained? I dunno it just fell flat.
436,2,"Rotten This is bad, like really really bad!!I'm a fan of marvel but I had to switch this off as i personally found it completely unwatchable.As has been said before, this seems like an absolute eternity, the characters are terrible and the acting stale.Best just to pretend this shambles never happened to be honest."
437,3,"An Awful, Ridiculous, Patronizing Film Eternals minimizes humankind's entire history to a footnote of a Game of Thrones fan fiction. Rob Stark is Superman and he f's Cerci until he doesn't so then his half brother John Snow gets in on the action.Oh, and God makes people but also monsters so he makes robots to kill the monsters, but the monsters didn't really die so the robots kill the monsters again.Then there's the stereotypical if not borderline offensive, and dare I say disappointing (as a Silicon Valley fan), use of Kumail Nanjiani; man wanted to be serious Marvel hero and got shredded only to sing and dance."
438,4,Boring The first hour seemed like three. It's as if Disney/Marvel spent the majority of the movie doing back stories in the hopes of turning this into a stand alone franchise.
439,1,"boring and full of the same clichés I didn't think that after some very good movies like Iron Man, Avengers, Thor or Doctor Strange, Black Panter Mervel studios could bring out such an aberration, old clichés, bad effects, actors too poor and out of script, but some must be understood things,, i notice that all the races have appeared here for obvious commercial reasons ..but besides these clichés with diversity, it is a shame this globalization in cinema.In conclusion , in my opinion, it left me with a terrible disgust and I hope that only such films will appear, otherwise a pity for all the initial work.boring and full of the same clichés."
440,1,"No review for this movie can be too bad I sat through this sad example of a movie and was reminded constantly how Hollywood has sunk so low. Intellectual and emotional marshmallow. This whole superhero thing was great in the 1940s, but now it is just a sad relic of where America has gone and should be relegated to the dustbin of history along with Donald Trump and Fox News."
441,1,"Boring & too long I watched the movie out of curiosity and I found it to be dull and boring with long introduction, focusing too much on Graphical and visual effects scenes, I couldn't understand what is it talking about and yet probably there's a sequel to it. The film could have been less than 2 hours."
442,1,"Absolutely awful With the scale of budget & scope of character development already having been a success in comic form, how it's possible to make such an appalling film, is baffling.It's neither one thing or another, it's neither fun nor high action adventure. No characters are likeable & the storyline is nothing short of pathetic."
443,2,"It really is that bad This movie has the most diverse and representative cast of all the MCU movies so far. Unfortunately, that is the only good thing about it. Everything else makes me want to go back and watch ""The Inhumans"" again because I don't remember that being this unwatchable. At least the lighting wasn't so poor in that show that I had to guess at what was going on half the time. I tried to see it through just because it seems like they are determined to wrap these characters into the MCU, but I mentally checked out about half way through and had to quit before I fell asleep. At that point, my dad, who was watching with me, had fallen asleep for the third time. He said he hoped they weren't planning to make a sequel to this because he would NOT want to watch it. I'm hoping that, like Inhumans, any plans to incorporate this into the MCU are scrapped because if this is where the series is going, retconning the most dull superrobot characters in and making them and this insane planet killing and recreating plot all-important, then I really don't care to follow."
444,9,Bold intriguing movie by marvel Incredibly interesting story taken in bold directions by marvel. The ending fell flat but the other arks of the movie are incredible and thought provoking. Can't wait to see more of the Eternals.
445,7,Should have been a Series Marvel had the potential to have one of it's best series ever if they had patience and didn't let movie theater numbers cloud their judgement. Regardless the movie flopped at the box office so it was all for not. I will say I went in with such low expectations that I came away surprised that I did enjoy it but at the same time know the potential it had if it had been done with more development rather than throw everything in the opening scene. Overall could of had potential of 10 stars as a series.
446,5,"A decent movie To be honest, I'm not even into Marvel or any other superhero movies, but my friends and I wanted to go to the movie theater and they really wanted to watch this movie, so I just thought to myself ""Why don't I just give it a try?"".To begin with the plot, it was really good and strong in my opinion with an excellent acting. Also the visuals and special effects were impressive, but on some superheroes it just looked silly and goofy.But overall it's a great and pretty decent movie in my opinion, I think it would be good for someone who isn't in that Marvel spectrum like me."
447,3,"Thor: The Dark World is no longer the worst Marvel movie! What a mess.This movie sucked from start to finish. The cast was...meh. Their acting was uninspired. The story was lacking to say the least. If this is the direction the MCU is heading, then I'm done.So long, Avengers...it was fun while it lasted."
448,8,"Pretty good, if a bit long But how short can a movie be that covers 7,000 years? 😁I knew Gemma Chan was good, but she really blew me away here. So nice to see the kind, compassionate woman be the main hero!I have no idea why this has gotten bad revirews. Could it be the diverse cast and female leads?"
449,7,"Fine EXPERIMENT by Marvel. Before watching the film, I was worried on how they'll introduce so many new characters within just 2.30 hrs as the time is not enough to tell all about themselves in detail. So, after finishing the film the good thing happened is that I get to know and understand all the characters but bad thing is that I didn't feel for any of them.While watching I was thinking that I was watching a completely new film and not a MCU film. As no old character re-appeared, only some mentioning was there. So, I can say that it was a fine experiment for Marvel and I liked it. One thing noone can deny is that this film is visually something else. Be it Thena's fight sequences or Makkari's running, it was looking great. Finally, it doesn't deserve 1% of hatred, it has got. I genuinely liked Eternals.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.© MandalBros."
450,5,"Gods among men Marvels Eternals tells the story of a group of advance aliens who come to Earth to slowly Usher in a prosperous future for humanity. While under the watchful eyes of the celestial's cosmic entity who study and maintain Life among the Cosmos. The Eternals live among the inhabitants watching as time passes and humanity evolves only interfering when their counterparts creatures called deviants are involved. Now deviants begin sprouting up again after 500 years and the Eternals of earth must stop an event even bigger then theirselves. I have to admit that this is probably one of marvel more ambitious movies. While being something that I doubt anybody would've probably expected. I'm not really a reader of the Enternals specifically, but I am familiar with who they are and the connection with the celestial's and how they're basically marvels version of the new gods. Many of those elements feel right for the picking for a new type of Style and theme that we have not seen yet. A very Stoic philosophical cosmic storytelling. Unfortunately the fact is eternals is kind of a chore to get through. The story is overall a incoherent mess it doesn't feel like it takes the time to actually set out pacing to make sort of a more natural flow. In many of these segments, the film is told specifically through flashbacks Between a days ago, to ancient times to the present. It feels like most of these flashbacks really don't serve much for a purpose in the overall plan what's going on in the present. It doesn't really flesh out all the characters, to really know all of them. If It probably started when they arrive on earth in Mesopotamia and then it showed pretty much more of their involvement of how they've evolved on being on this planet with humans. Seeing how their actions shape humanity it would probably add more depth, to decisions made near the end of the film. It also doesn't help that while the film tries to make room. The fact that you have 10 new characters in a single film. Some obviously get way more screentime then others such as Icarus and Sersi. Who are probably the most developed out of all of them but still throwing pointless romance drama between them is just tiresome. Also not helping that Icarus is bland as cornflakes for majority of the movie. One of the more funnier members of the Team is Kingo who basically poses as a Bollywood star pretending to be all the descendants In this fake family. He actually gets a few good laughs. Same with his human manager. While others like Selma Hayek and Angelia Jolie characters are so forgettable. Especially Angelia who does so little,that spirte has more character then her. It's a shame that the films faults on so many of these aspects. Because at the same time you can see elements of the film where a lot of this could work and you actually have a good premise there's a scene where they're in the Aztec empire and conquistadors are invading and they're arguing about not getting involved but one of them wants to get involved and one of them is actually responsible for the technology of guns. I mean it offers some good themes if only they would've stuck to one story instead of multiple things. The action is really generic as well many visuals especially the use of this gold wire effect that is used constantly throughout the whole film. It just doesn't look good it looks terrible it looks unfinished. Along with the deviants who later in the film once you're aware what's going on these guys are even more pointless and irrelevant to the bigger picture. Really their all just generic monsters. It doesn't help that the main Deviant you barely remember is around. Overall Eternals is just a mediocre at best film it has very terrible Pacing. It's character development and many jokes don't really flow feel natural or even that funny. The biggest highlight of the entirety of the film is the fact that the celestial's are alive and active in the MCU meaning that cosmic entities such as Galactus or the beyonder are possible for furture installment."
451,7,"Tried to do too much I'll say they did a surprising job with introducing 10 new characters and making them sympathetic - thats a big task to take on. Unfortunately it was just kind of a boring movie. The plot just wasn't that compelling and the origin of the Eternals is kinda silly in my humble opinion. With the scale of their powers, I really didn't feel a sense of stakes in this movie. I'm having trouble seeing them tie in naturally with the new Avengers but maybe they don't need to. Either way, the characters were interesting but I just didn't feel like I cared much about them or their plight. They set up really interesting and existential ideas but don't quite take it home."
452,5,"Marvel is running out of steam The MCU has produced some fantastic films with unforgettable characters. ETERNALS is not one of them. Having used up the bulk of Marvel's best-known characters, and the X-Men and Fantastic Four still not available for MCU use, Marvel had begun scraping the barrel for heroes that were completely unknown to any but hardcore comic fans.The ETERNALS was a poor choice to introduce a new super-team. Granted, the Guardians of the Galaxy was equally unknown to the non-comic-reading moviegoer, but the original team was only five characters who were introduced as individuals. The Eternals is a NINE member team that is shown from the beginning as being a cohesive group. This allows very little chance to make the team a group of individuals, as had been the great strength of the Avengers and the Guardians. Instead of developed characters with genuine character growth, the Eternals are introduced as character types with some of them receiving dramatic plot twists.There is no sense of connection with the rest of the MCU. When the Guardians were introduced it was with already-established baddie Thanos as the highest-level villain. The ""Deviants"" are as unfamiliar as the heroes, and the audience is unclear as to their powers, motivations, or nature until too deep into the film. The only connections to the rest of the MCU are throwaway references to the ""blip"" and to the Avengers losing their leadership. The reasons for the Eternals not participating in the Infinity War are at least covered, albeit unconvincingly, but there is no explanation why the literally earth-shaking final battle in ETERNALS doesn't attract the attention of the dozens of metahumans already active on the Earth.With a run time of 2:36, ETERNALS plods along, with the many flashback scenes making the story hard to follow. The special effects are, as always, great, but ultimately aren't enough to carry the film."
453,1,"Eternal must be your patience to endure this movie until the end. I haven't watched a movie as bad as this in a long time, really. Okay, it has amazing CGI and special effects, but even that doesn't save this movie from complete tragedy. Bad direction, bad work by the actors (some scenes get to be comical because they are so bad), bad soundtrack, stupid dialogues and horrible script. All this festival of crap in a movie with almost 3 hours long, we need to be more powerful than the Eternals to face all this endless suffering.For me, I would have stopped watching it with 20 minutes, but my 8-year-old son comes home here a few times, and he really wanted to see the movie, I made the sacrifice of holding on until the end.Who hasn't seen it yet and wants to take a chance, well, I recommend being prepared for the worst.Rating: 0,5/10."
454,6,"SLOW PLEASURE The Movie Took A Long Period To Explain It's Character Which Overshadows The Villians, But The Vibes Were Good. The Movie Could Be Around 2:10 Hours If Possible."
455,1,"Worst Marvel Just terrible. Boring. Doesn't make sense. So Lonnnngg. I had a hard time keeping focus. Some random casting of half game of thrones actors and some washed up actresses. Just because ""marvel"" is in the opening credits doesn't mean it's good."
456,4,Stop connecting everything to mcu This movie is average at best. It has a tenuous connection to Marvel. It would have been better without the connection. They tried to force a connection that didn't need to be there.
457,6,"A good movie, but it's rarely a fun movie Due to the events of Avengers: Endgame, the snap that brought about the return of half the universe's population kick starts the emergence: the awakening of a new Celestial, the gods of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Eternals, an immortal race of beings created by the Celestials, unite to protect humanity from their longstanding foes, the Deviants.Directed by Chloe Zhao, Eternals is easily the most mature film the in MCU catalog. Intercourse in a comic book movie aside, the theme of sacrifice versus duty is the main sticking point of the story. The plot stumbles a bit under its own weight, and while Zhao is free of any narrative restraints (with no other movies to set up or feed into besides its own sequel), the exposition is at times muddled and slightly confusing. The population of Earth has been threatened multiple times, either to be subjugated by the likes of Loki or the Red Skull, wiped off the map by Ultron, or just reduced 50% by Thanos. Eternals, however, is the first time in an MCU movie the Earth itself is at risk as our heroes work to thwart the Deviants. The Celestials, powerful beings who created the universe, promote an endless cycle of creating new life through death and with that brings the central conflict of the movie, which I'll not spoil here.While the Avengers managed to mostly get standalone films to introduce them to the universe before assembling them in the 2012 blockbuster, Eternals is forced to do all of its character introductions and development in one film, which is difficult considering the source material is relatively unknown to the general audience. While it's unfortunate that some characters inevitably suffered for the development of others, the diverse cast of talented actors and actresses amassed makes for a nice reminder that heroes can come in all colors, ages, shapes, and sizes.Starring an eclectic cast of actors and actresses, our main focus is placed on Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. Chan, known for this being her second role in the MCU (her first being a small role in Captain Marvel), easily shoulders the weight of being the lead actress, and she rises to the challenge. Charming, beautiful, and empathetical towards humans, Chan's Sersi serves as the logical character for the audience to latch onto. Richard Madden, forever cemented as Robb Stark on HBO's A Game of Thrones, plays Ikaris, the most powerful Superman-like Eternal. While Sersi has a firm connection with the people of Earth, Ikaris is more emotionally detached, and that difference between the two of them plays throughout the film's runtime. The will-they-won't-they story is bolstered by the fact that Chan and Madden have great chemistry on screen together.Apart from them, the rest of the cast are more than up to the task of playing their near immortal characters. While Salma Hyek is intermittent throughout the film, her presence and impact reverberates throughout the rest of the characters and Hayek's performance lends the right amount of depth and weight needed for the role. In the film for a hair's breath of time, but still worthy of mentioning, is Harish Patel as Karun, Kingo's manager. Karun is the only human the audience sees in constant contact with the Eternals and thanks to Patel's charm and humor, the character serves as a reminder to the audience of what the team is fighting for.The Academy Award winning Chloe Zhao is fairly restrained here, having to work under the Marvel Studios regime of filmmaking, but there's still signs of brilliance in well composed shots and intriguing action sequences. While the technical work doesn't reach the levels of her previous film Nomadland, Eternals is still visually interesting. Cinematographer Ben Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel) brings a different eye to this movie than in his previous MCU collaborations. The color palette is more muted here, as if the more adult themes presented necessitated the banishment of bright, bombastic colors. The movie is aided by composer Ramin Djawadi's score, which soars at times, complimenting the emotional journey the principle cast embarks upon.Overall, Eternals' millennia-spanning ambition doesn't quite reach its grasp. With its more somber tone and moral complexity, it's a film that stands out like a sore thumb from the more bright and colorful MCU films we've seen to date. Solid performances from both Gemma Chan and Richard Madden anchors the movie, while Zhao's direction is steady and competent. While it takes a bit to get the story rolling, its 157 minute runtime could use a bit of judicious editing to present a slimmer, more lean film. When it boils to steam, it comes down to this: Eternals is a good movie, but it's rarely a fun movie. Eternals hits theaters November 5th."
458,4,"The best cgi i seen in mcu movie, much beauty shoot, lack of plot. This movie have beautifull shoot, but the story itself its boring and dont fit the shoot they take. The shoot itself should've try to catch the script, its no use if both of them not have chemistry, chloe zao didnt understand how to handle superhero movie."
459,1,Sooooo bad I suffered about an hour of the awful movie. The script was nonsense and the acting wooden. I advise everyone to avoid this. This has to be an all time low for MCU even Captain Marvel slightly better. You have been warned.
460,2,"Worst MCU film ever Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants.This film is by far the worst MCU film I have watch. It's massive insuylt to the comics from the Jack Kirby days. Gender swapping some of the eternals, bad story telling which makes absolutely no sense, unlikeable characters, little to no action and ridicules changes to the MCU just sum up how bad this film. Completely ruined EndgameThe only goods were the music and the CGI for Arishen as well as bonus points for being voiced by David Kaye.Other then that it's just not a good movie makes both Captain Marvel and Iron Man 3 look good."
461,5,Such a big disappointment This movie could have been so much better. The major flaw in the movie was its drag. The story line was strong but the time of 2 and half hours was too long. The actors in the whole movie kind of looked disinterested. And god save those oneliner. All the wait after endgame for an another marvel movie was such a dissappointment.
462,8,This movie had 4 flaws 1. False marketing by saying Angelina Jolie was the big star.2. It was way too long for something new to be introduced.3. It had a view common cliché's.4. It had too many plottwists.5. The group splitting in the finale was weird.6. anti-climax at the end.Furthermore it was awesome. If we get a cut where it's shorter it would be great. Not badly written and not cringe or dumb. Maybe a bit too serious. 8/10.
463,2,"Sometimes life gives you lemons This film is really poor, I've loved most of the marvel films but Eternals is worser than a movie with Natalie Portman in.I feel sorry for everyone who watched this film including me.Please don't give your money to watch this movie.Go and enjoy your life and watch a good movie like the new West Side Story or wait for a good marvel movie.Keep the faith people.Best of luck."
464,4,It was a snoozefest If it wouldn't be for the LGBTQ inclusion I would rate this even lower.Thanks for the gay scenens though!There is nothing wrong with the actors or how they act but the story and the plot is just not amusing.
465,5,"Visually splendid but with contradictory arguments This movie manages to be visually wonderful, but the story development is contradicting and incongruous.The story takes its time to create the conflict, which may seem very tedious, but due to its visual splendor it ends up not mattering much, but the development of the characters contradicts the plot, since they are supposed to be a type of alien but they feel very human, especially because of the diversity of these, since that ends up making zero sense in the plot and it only seems that these actors were chosen in order to attract an audience that resembled them and have more profits despite the fact that their diversity is not related with the story. Because of this, the plot contradicts itself many times, as well as creating holes in it that are never answered or developed. The special effects and photography are perfect, all the fights and scenes involving big special effects are well done and look very real. The acting is decent and the humor it uses feels very childish at times.The main attraction of this film is the visuals, the special effects and the photography that play a major role in the story, but the plot and the development of this constantly contradict each other, making it incongruous, the inclusion in this film is very forced, since the diversity of actors that there is, does not cause any change in the plot, showing that the studios are not interested in telling a good story where this diversity is involved, but only use them to generate more profits than expected."
466,2,Seriously What is it with films jumping round the director needs firing. I got about 20mins in I was in current century in an apartment they said we will have a family reunion and the whole film jumped to a different century and a war scene with no link what is that all about. You need a link to make it make sense seriously if you can't direct stop trying to!!! Stop with all this history jumps this isn't the only marvel film spoiled with such junk either!
467,1,"Wow. Shockingly bad. As a Marvel fan I find this absolutely appalling. The acting is as wooden as can be, and the script is as woeful. I think the producers really need to look at what they have done here. I didn't even bother watching it to the end. A wrong choice of director too, if this is what then envisaged for the Marvel franchise.You should all be ashamed."
468,6,Eh So my husband are more than on with marvel movies. Every time one comes out we are more then ready to sit down and finally watch it. But this movie was far from what we thought. Maybe plot wholes and as a whole just wasn't very good..
469,4,"Is MCU reaching an Eternal End? I love MCU. When I think about Marvel I think of a wonderful collection of heroes, packed with unique stories that makes them entertaining, fun and singular.I don't mind long movies either. As long as the time is well used and stucks my attention to the screen, I'm in for a long movie!This particular movie however, was a big disappointment from my point of view. I feel since Disney touched both Star Wars and Marvel, these two brands seem to have diluted their appeal.For example, we all know the spiderman story. There is very little a movie about spiderman can surprise us with. And still, when in 2002 one of the spider-man movies was launched it was an outstanding movie with an overall rating by either critics and general population much superior to this ""Eternals"" movie.To make a movie is not just to follow the story from the comics. It's down to how you set up the presentation of the characters, how you build a relationship between the characters and the people watching the movie. How deep do you make the character to be felt by the audience. How you have the ""raise of the character"". Every MCU outstanding movie we see this ""raise of the character"": Steve Rogers, from skiny guy trying to get to the army to Cap. America. Iron man, from prisoner to building an iron suit. Thor, from banished from his kingdom to hero... I mean, I'm not going to continue, but this is a simple ingredient that anyone doing movies should know.Then you have the villain. A character we tend to dislike just as much as we like our hero.Then we have a twist (most of the times) and then a climax.This movie has nothing of this. And therefore, anyone watching it tends to say ""I feel this movie is a bit shallow...a bit flat"" There ate just too many ingredients of direction and production missing.Maybe the actors sensed this and it reflected in their charisma. The variation of facial expressions was so low that we couldn't really attach a feeling to who was good and who was bad. We can't really compare anyone from this movie to for example Robert Downey Jr. In his MCU movies.I mean, maybe I am ""over-analysing"" but I have seen far more intertaining movies with less plot to explore.My suggestion: maybe Disney should ensure that the basics of Movie making are there, and only then splash the movies with imagination and beauty."
470,3,"Absolutely disgusting What can I say? Boring, stupid, not interesting. A typical story about a superheroes team, who are willing to save the world. All of their actions look like nonsense, this movie is even worse than Justice League.Boring, flat characters that arouse neither interest nor sympathy. I had to watch this movie, only to stay up to date with what's happening in the marvel universe. 3/10."
471,2,"Disney butchering Marvel once again Really poor film. No real explained storyline and just an excuse to cast lots of popular faces. Also, it is embarrassing that Marvel have casted Harry Styles as the brother of the best villain in the MCU, Thanos. He needs to stick to singing. Awful CGI for most of the film too."
472,2,"Would have benefited more as a tv show on Disney+ If you look at the other MCU movies like Captain America trilogy, and Guardians movies. They're different yes, but they have the Marvel in them. Which Eternals lacked.Uneven pace, weak forgetable villain. Weird sex scene. Even some of the Eternals are poorly written.People are being too nice to this movie because of the Marvel Studios logo."
473,2,"Don't waste your time. Not even at home Boring. Unintelligible. 2:35h of fireworks, flat performances and historical clichés.A for a plot line that tries to encompass the whole human history, and even if it's destined to entertain rather than to educate, the writers seem to betray the goal of an over-representative cast (I can't think of a non represented minority) to fall in an American-centric vision of history."
474,2,Another sleeper They are really running short of good story lines. Add replicas of Superman and give powers to a dozen ....but where is the story. One hour & I was thinking .....wait wait....something will happen. This movie and that SHANG CHI .....both really bad.....bad bad bad. Pay more to good story writers. What was Rob stark doing in the movie ????
475,4,"Bad. Bad. BAD! The whole production was like an extended episode of a mediocre TV show.If this is the way the MCU is heading - as they say in Dragon's Den - ""I'm out""."
476,2,"Felt like an eternity to watch I get it, some people are into comic books and know the back story of characters and history and maybe they enjoyed it.Personally though, the movie dragged on for what felt like an eternity - yes, pun fully intended. Halfway through I did pause to consider whether I'd enjoy going for a double root canal compared to having to watch the movie again.I don't like to hate for the sake of hating - and there were some positives. The cinematography was lovely, most of the special effects were spot on, and what a stellar cast!Unfortunately, all the characters felt under developed. If anyone was in peril or was doing a good or bad thing, I just wasn't invested enough to care. I mean, by comparison, DC did a better job at character development with Justice League.Maybe I was just expecting too much from the MCU. All previous movies and even the Disney + tv shows have been overall really good. So, this just stood out like a sore thumb.Obviously, Marvel being Marvel left us with possibilities for spin-offs, sequels, and another sub-universe. But I plead with the studio execs ""no more!"""
477,7,"Decent, at least to me Watched it the other night and after lots of negative reviews I didn't really know what to expect.But I have to say that I was a little bit surprised in a positive way.It's quite entertaining and the story is ok with different characters. In general I have of course enjoyed the Avengers more but Eternals was as I said a little bit better than expected.I hope Marvel will continue their story. It will be interesting to see where they go from here:"
478,5,"Disappointing and incoherent Rather disappointed. The storyline seems quite forced and lacks a coherent flow.Most actors are doing the best they can but still have issues becoming trustworthy in the roles. And the shift between existentialism and plain comedy just doesn't work.Visually well made, but not something I'd watch a second time."
479,9,"Risky I have read the comics in the 90ties and know the eternal/deviant backstory. The mcu has it's own story which is fine (deviants in reality were experimented on early humans and now live underground (read the marvel wiki). But all in all I really enjoyed it, also seeing Pip and Eros appear and the ground created for the Black Knight. How they portrait the Celestials though, absolutely perfect, and bumped my 8 to a 9."
480,5,"Yuck! Ask someone who has seen this movie to tell you their favourite part. They won't be able to. Nothing is memorable, none of the characters are likeable and no one has any chemistry with anyone else in any scene!Souless with great special effects."
481,10,Great Action & Cast! If you love Marvel movies you'll love this one too! Just watch it! I loved the action and the diversity of the cast! I'm looking forward to more! I'm hoping they'll cross this with the Avengers soon! And I can't wait to see Kit Harrington as the Black Knight since there's no more Jon Snow lol.
482,6,It felt unneeded 7000 years ago ten Eternals were sent to Earth. Their job was to eliminate Deviants and when the mission was done they would leave.The cast feels weird. Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie as superheros. The movie just doesn't fit in the MCU universe. I felt like Captain Marvel was too much. She was too strong and made the universe unreal. Now we get 10 immortals with superhuman powers.The movie was in my opinion all right. Nothing special about the acting but still felt a bit weird with some of the actors. All the characters were very plain and it was hard to get a feel for any of them. And the movie had some funny parts but not really serious in my opinion.Overall an okay movie. No need to watch to understand any of the other Marvel movies. I would have given it a 5 if it weren't for Harish Patel (the camera guy).
483,7,"Decent film It's an alright film to watch if you have nothing else to do. The Eternals weren't very powerful individually and even as a group, which was kind of lame to me. Felt like there were more questions than answers while watching this, especially towards the end of the movie. Definitely an underwhelming Marvel movie though, if you were going in with some expectations."
484,1,"Rubbish I changed my rating because you didn't post my first review, what I thought about the eternals, rubbish................... ..........................rubbish...................................................... if they are trying to push every one to see that man plus man and women plus women no offense it shouldn't be portrayed in the movie and for children to think it's okay if that's okay then the sky is the limit.No wonder this planet is one big brothel."
485,10,Fantastic!!!! I actually really liked this film!!! I wouldn't be surprised that critics are bashing it for discomfort reasons. Diversity and representation matter 💕
486,3,"Phase 5 lacking compared to its predecessor Found this absolutely awful, the powers where rubbish and weak and it wasn't even funny they were trying too hard. Some copied moments of Avengers aka Bruce and Black Widow. When you watch it you'll know what I mean. Couldn't connect with any of them maybe a TV series would have been better. Makes me miss avengers assemble. Acting was not all that either."
487,3,"Stellar cast with nothing to work with I haven't even finished this yet. We've got 47 minutes remaining, but just couldn't anymore. A potential DNF. I've read a few reviews here, and as I find with book reviews, I ask, why do people give such high stars with such bad reviews? They should match up a bit better, IMO. Now I admit, I'm relatively new to the ""universe"", and loved Deadpool, AntMan, Guardians of the Galaxy, WandaVision, etc. But this? We'd laughed out loud, and not in the good way, at the previews (laser eyes!) but gave it a go because every freakin Spider-Man movie (Sony property) is pay-per-view or requires cable (we only stream). Back to The Eternals: so far we've seen well-known stars like Selma Hayek, Angelina Joliet, and even the fabulous signing girl from Walking Dead (Also Jon Snow! Hard to recognize now, and his brother Robb) with lame scripts, no humor, no satisfactory explanation of their purpose on earth if the Deviants were defeated. WHY didn't they just go home? WHY can only one of them communicate with their creator? WHY care if the humans get eaten? My first reaction was, ""If the Deviants feed on intelligent life, why are they on earth?"" But I digress.I had looked forward to at least the historical aspect of this movie, and with the characters' cheesy, play-on names, expected to see ACTUAL influence on human events beyond keeping the technology in reverse for a millennia. ""Thena"", short for Athena? Nope. ""Ikaris"", no relation to Icarus until apparently the very end, which we haven't made it to yet, the myth explained as a story told by ""Sprite"", an androgynous child Eternal who CAN seemingly shapeshift into other sizes/shapes/genders/skintones, but doesn't, instead remains a boy/girl child in a terrible wig. My son, 16, described it best as, ""it looks like someone scalped the child of Chucky"". Which brings me to costumes and makeup. The costumes were 80s tacky PowerRangers and makeup was terribly underused. Poor Selma looked every bit her age, and she could've/should've been more glamorous. They are Eternals, FFS. The sets were also sparse; CGI of the hanging gardens of Babylon that looked like I created them, and nothing around them. Same with the famous Gates of Ishtar; gates, monster thrown into it, and Gilgamesh himself emerges from them. No city, nothing else. And the scene was about as long as it took you to read my disappointment in it. Weird, and nothing in this movie FELT like Marvel. So, do I blame the director? The writers? The producer? All of them? Just an epic disappointment. To be continued, if we dare..."
488,5,"Confusing Time Jumps This movie had great cinematography (being a marvel movie and all) and I really tried to like it... but it was just odd.Throughout the movie, there were was these time jumps happening so often that at one point I didn't even know if the scene was taking place in the past or present.I took the time to watch this movie twice and probably wouldn't watch again (unless doing a marvel marathon)."
489,7,Overall a good movie. Worth giving a shot. Eternals is visually stunning and shows good character development (not so good in few places). Story is also good but in few places feels slow. Overall it is a good movie. Worth giving a shot.
490,3,"Didn't expect it to be this bad. But it is. Oh my God, what did I just watch? Wooden actors spouting wooden dialogue. Or monologue. Uninspired faceshots after another, while a ridiculous science fiction story is fed through on screen text or narrated delivery.And what a bunch of awful, unlikeable or simply boring characters. Most of which have powers that are just rehashed from existing superheroes. From ""The Boys""/""Superman"", ""Flash"", ""Iron Man"", ""Black Widow"" or ""Dr Strange"".Plus all the interesting stuff falls flat. Or leads to nowhere. The dagger artifact that plays no role at all. The evil super deviant. The eternal/mortal love interest. The thieving eternal. The butler was cool, though. And props for a gay kiss in a Marvel film.Too many characters that get way too much screen time in uninspired dialogues and slow faceshots. A script that is a mess. A post-production that doesn't cut out unnecessary 45 minutes. Too much narration, too many monologues. A diversity approach that felt forced and artificial.The whole subtitle text part was BTW pretty hard for my child who can read well for its age but not necessarily in this speed.Overall the worst Marvel film yet."
491,8,"GREAT WORLD BUILDING Not a comic reader and don't know the MCU but I didn't mind the Eternals. I loved the special FX and the world building. I liked the actors, the casting was good. It was a little cheesy at times but it's Disney.It was a little long bouncing through all those centuries but I know we needed to get more backstory. I enjoyed this movie that's probably why it has a higher audience score on Rotten Tomatoes than critics score. If I am indifferent to a character death then I don't really care about the film. I cared about all of these characters.TIGHTENING up the run time and it will be fab."
492,2,"Yawn boring. This movie was so boring, I felt like I was going to die. While I was watching a movie I just kept thinking to myself, damn I wish I was watching a better story. I just can't believe that I sat through the whole thing without falling asleep, maybe because most of the time I had to look at my phone just to keep myself awake."
493,2,Boring It's a boring show and doesn't worth to stay tune until end of movie. Contents are messy and into half of the time I still do not get what they are truly driving at. More of emotion feature from each hero rather than revealing the actual objective.
494,1,"Sad! After the Batman joke, all this movie deserves is 1 star. I can't believe Marvel has done something like this with all these expensives actors and right after produce Avengers Endgame."
495,5,"There's a good movie in here somewhere Somewhere in this long, plodding mess, a good movie is buried. I actually think the core plot and themes of Eternals is pretty good and interesting. But the following problems, listed in reverse order of importance, really cripple the film and make it one of the weakest entries in the MCU.First off, what is the deal with the color and light balance? I watched this movie on Disney plus at home; perhaps the experience is different in other settings, but I constantly struggled to make out what was happening in the many low-light settings. I actually had to rebalance the video settings on my tv. I've seen plenty of dimly lit shows and movies before, and I've never had to resort to changing my settings. From time to time, I also noticed issues with the audio balance too. Ie, the voice of the celestial was strangely muted.Secondly, the movie is way too reliant on CGI, and it's not very good CGI. This is particularly a problem for movies where the baddies are 100% rendered. The whole thing feels plastic, like watching a cartoon or video game cutscene.Thirdly and most importantly, this movie falls into the classic trap of presenting upfront a superhero team without any precursor development. I thought the whole point of the MCU was to avoid this? The Eternals are a group of ten(10!!) heroes that we've never seen before. How can ten protagonists possibly be given proper treatment in one film? The group as a whole (already established at the movie's onset) is also brand new to audiences. By contrast, the origin of the team was precisely the plot of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie.What is the result of this? *Exposition*. Grueling, in-your-face plot exposition told through montages (which are further deadened by the aforementioned CGI), monologues and flat conversations. The movie compounds this by springing back and forth through time (10s or 100s of years at once) in order to sprinkle in tiny bits that are supposed to add dimension and color to the characters; the payoff is never worth the break in flow caused by these excursions.There are a lot of comedic quips, many that fall flat and many that probably will age very poorly, but those are not enough to blow life into what often feels like an overly long trudge."
496,4,"Even my kids were questioning the plot Too many characters introduced at once.A mess of a film and reeks of desperation. I'm convinced the quality of talent only saw this as a cash opportunity, but were too late to the MCU party."
497,3,"Terrible The special effects do not make up for the awful acting, bad storyline and once again....awful acting. On top of that, it's really boring as well. Easily the worst of the Marvel movies."
498,1,Hmmm Can't believe anyone would give this a 5 or over even if they are huge marvel fans. Poorly written and was hoping to get through on special effects. Nope it's a massive fail.
499,5,"Another misfire in Phase 4 of the MCU Eternals (2021) is the 26th entry in the MCU, a part of Phase 4 of the franchise and it is about a group of Alien beings who have been on Earth for thousands of years protecting mankind from another alien race called Deviants and they now have to reunite and face the ancient threat which has resurfaced. Similar to Guardians of the Galaxy, this is one of those Marvel properties that I had no prior knowledge of and the movie was my first foray into their story. Unlike Guardians of the Galaxy, though, it was not good.The movie has a lot of problems and it falls under the umbrella of those flicks where the more you think about it, the worse it gets, and if you don't think about it, it's middling at best, as elements and players introduced by the story and trying to squeeze them in an already expansive Universe lacks well thought out writing for proper cohesion and thus it comes off as lazy and stupid. Case in point: The Celestials, the true Godly Beings that have been shown a few times before in the MCU but this is the movie where you get a proper explanation about their existence and when the plot reveals details about the Prime Celestial Arishem's design, it's just dumb and saps whatever interest one might have had in that part of the story and worldbuilding.Since I have grown a bit apathetic towards this cinematic universe due to worldbuilding shenanigans that Phase 4 has shown so far, poor writing in that area alone wouldn't have been a big issue (would still be an issue) had the characters been interesting but that turned out to be the biggest problem of this movie which stems from its own nature of being i.e there are ten Eternals, ten main new characters that are introduced in a single movie, and none of them is properly developed. As I write this review, I don't even remember the names of many of them. On top of that, director Chloe Zao decided to have the cast give uninterested/boring and bland performances for so much of the runtime instead of being energetic and charismatic utilizing every bit of screen time they have to imbue personality to their roles. There was also lost potential of a plot point regarding Deviants, the movie just ends it in an anti-climatic fashion and throws it away.With all that being said, I did enjoy certain things. There were some beautiful visuals, particularly with the Celestials and their gargantuan scale, especially if you don't think about the physics of it all. Some of the fights were entertaining even with the iffy CGI, the speedster Eternal especially was portrayed how I'd wish other movies to showcase their speed type characters and you get a fun meta pseudo Superman vs Flash throwdown. Despite having thin characterization, some Eternals I did end up liking such as Druig, Gilgamesh or even Icarus, and hell I even got interested in that one Deviant since that seemed important relative to most characters in the movie. I also do applaud the director for not filling the movie to the brim with the typical Marvel brand of humour which has been getting too annoying recently and I wish strong writing was present to complement the more serious tone. Plus, the movie had both Jon Snow and Robb Stark fall in love with Sersi which I found amusing.Overall, this is in the bottom tier of MCU movies for me. I wouldn't say it's the worst one, that title belongs to Black Widow for now. I don't know how the events in Eternals will play out going forward in the MCU or whether it'll have any impact or would be forgotten. This probably would have fared far better if it was a Disney+ series instead as that would have given it time to develop its characters at the very least even if at the loss of spectacle. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're an MCU fan and completionist. Anyway, if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 5/10."
500,5,Didn't feel any connection I didn't feel any connection with any character. It was like some dream sequence no real people were involved. Just some robots fighting themselves and pretending that they are saving humans.
501,4,Glad I didn't see it in the cinema! The most interesting bit in the whole movie is in the last few seconds of the credits. I want to see more of that.The film itself was just too long and doesn't feel connected to the rest of the Marvel Universe.So they end up protecting the earth (TBH - I'm not even sure if I'd bother now) but they were on scouts honour not to do anything whilst aliens tried to destroy New York before. That's some patience to do nothing for thousands of years and STILL just sit on your hands.If we don't see the Eternals back - I won't be sad.
502,6,"Could have been better. The cinematography looked great, no complaints there. Gemma Chan looked beautiful. The story was okay, it didn't bother me too much.But the acting was terrible. Angelina Jolie in my humble opinion was miscast. I also didn't like that one of the characters was gay, it felt extremely out of place. Don't get me wrong I'm not a homophobe, I enjoyed watching sitcoms like Will & Grace or Modern family. But it didn't work in this movie, I didn't believe it for a second, it felt forced and didn't add anything to the story.I also thought the ending was rather abrupt, it seemingly came out of nowhere.The director probably learned a lot making this movie, but I doubt she'll be directing the sequel. I can't help but feel that she was in way over her head."
503,5,"A feast for the eyes, but lacking a consistent narrative and vision The problem of ""Eternals"" is it's core message.For billions of years, over thousands of planets, these weirdly human synthetic service bots in fancy costumes served their masters as some kind of planetary imune system to faithfully breed new Celestials.And here we are, on Earth, and we are so super special, so immensly impressive, that even though it means that the cycle of all live comes to an end, seeing your adopted kid grow up is somehow more important. For a synthetic, programmed entity that shouldn't even be on that planet anymore since it was deviant-free for hundreds of years.The writing is losing itself in really huge ideas and giant concepts that are ten numbers too big to push the actual narrative. It's a little sad since the visuals and the design are excellent, the acting is absolutely aceptable, it's just that in a all-of-time-and-space-spanning story the characters and their stories are bound to seem inconsequential.If they had just cut back on the scale and focus a little more, this could have been a nice, forgettable superhero pop corn movie. But putting the universe on hold for a Bollywood career? That was a little bit too much for the good old suspension of disbelieve."
504,9,"Different and Good If you want regular marvel stuff watch End game again, This one still trying to be funny but different than other Marvel movies ,Chloe Zhao's directing and coloring are making all fight scenes and action dull , it is more like everyday stuffs at least for young audience but for me this difference makes this movie something I didn't see before. You can't portray very old beings like you portray antman, Tone need to be mature.But I can understand why people giving low rating, it is not a perfect movie long and slow moments always get some people angry and movie has and alternative creation story that might anger some Adam and Eve fans (forgetting it's just a movie), Homophobes will get angry too and there is a heterosexual sex scene that might get some people angry.Because of all this empty reasons this movie has low rating, Lower than it actually deserves.I like what I watched ,don't let bad reviews misguide you watch it and form your own opinion."
505,8,"Why the MCU fanbase decided to collectively dislike a not-so-bad movie. Even though I'm not a hardcore Marvel fan, I've been following all their extended universe movies and tv shows. Eternals isn't something you'd expect from a typical Marvel movie. Your typical marvel movies are obvious about themes of good and evil, heroes and villains and so forth. Eternals on the other hand tackles more vague themes that majority of the Marvel fanbase finds boring. Besides all that, the movie is actually well written and directed. Characters are original and actors have done a pretty neat job. Musical score is just okay I guess but it goes along well. All in all, it's a good movie that has been attacked by fanbase when it comes to ratings."
506,3,"Forgettable at Best There are some Marvel movies. I truly dislike. They are weak writing and make lazy nonsensical choices for the characters to manipulate the plot. I would rate those higher than this. This was just disappointing. It felt like five plus hours of characters and plot that I just couldn't care about. It's amazing that in a movie that long, they couldn't develop characters enough for the audience to form some kind of connection with them.Also, I know they were bragging about how they shot the fight scenes differently with far less special effects than other movies, but it didn't work. I watched this at home, not in theaters, and no matter how high I turned up the brightness, the bulk of the fight scenes were basically hazy darkness. Shooting fight scenes in the dark to obscure mistakes is nothing new. In fact, it was nice to see that going by the wayside.Overall, I have to say that this truly is my least favorite Marvel film by far. And, it's not because there are obvious plot manipulations or character's personalities are assassinated. They didn't leave a gaping plot hole in the ending for the audience to fill in that is just infuriating. It's not that kind of bad. It's just because, in the end, I don't care about this film. At all. It made zero impression on me, and when I think of Marvel and their film catalogue, this won't even occur to me as having been part of it. It's completely forgettable."
507,2,"Awful.....just awful If this is the future of the Marvel universe, D. C. will be laughing all the way to the bank !!We managed an hour,and not sure how we made it that far! Slow; dull; boring; disjointed garbage."
508,3,"As a marvel fan, this hurts to watch... This I by far one of the worst, If not the worst movie in the MCU (Marvel cinematic universe). The acting was dead, the characters dry.Marvel always plan a bigger picture, but I really don't want to see the Eternals in any future movies. Also that Harry Styles end credit-scene was just...hard to watch.When Marvel introduces new characters, I 'm always exited to how they are gonna fit in, in this universe, but this time i'm not at all looking forward to see how these characters are gonna affect the universe.Now there are some ""good"" things. I am very interested about the whole celestial thing. And I look some what forward to see that in future projects, but the Eternals....nah, not so much.Overall this was not a great movie, and the acting was really bad. However I do trust marvel, and I know Kevin Feige is an absolute genius, so let's see what's to come."
509,2,"The MCUs implosion begins Ok ill try again since my first review hasn't made it, in short, this film had no good direction, no good acting, no good fight choreography, no character development, the characters have no chemistry between each other, in fact it was like watching a group of 'ex's' bumping into each other awkwardly, the cast seem to have been selected by a paint by numbers committee that required all boxes ticked, the film is devoid of artistic story and character driven integrity, the film is easily the worse MCU film and possibly one of the worse films ever made in general. The film makes very little sense at all and even less sense in the context of its place in the MCU. I can only hope this film is eventually explained as occurring in an alternate universe."
510,10,"Refreshing I don't get the hate for this film. Yes it is a departure from the regular MCU films but it was a refreshing change. A thoughtful, moody and insightful look into the characters for once, rather than a melee of action with the occasional peppering of character development."
511,2,"Disappointing - This is what you get if you try to achieve in 2 hours what the MCU did with 25 moves in 14 yeara. Lots of loose ends, lots of plot holes and no emotional connect at all with any of the characters. Very disappointing."
512,3,"So bad it's like DC made it Long (oh god, SO long...) after the first week I had to give up. Dreary and overly serious with a stupid premise and no real point. It takes itself way too seriously and after a while you find yourself supporting the bad guys, hoping they'll quickly put the sad-sack drama queen so-called superheroes out of your misery. Don't bother, just wait for Dr Strange, Spider-Man or some other real Marvel movie."
513,7,"Expected a lot worse but It was just boring and unoriginal and lazy written as always. I didn't liked the gold color of their powers, they could have made something more majestic as for real gods. The names could have been other than the Greek gods copies. The sound of Ikaris laser was annoying and they should have taken notes from Zack Snyder about the flying movements and floating, it was very weak and cheap. Thena and Gil carried this movie, Sersei was not almost useless and i didn't liked the shooting from fingers and kameha powers. They could have done better, the story was clicheic and predictable but over and above all it was not that bad. Venom 2, Black Widow, Spider-Man No way home, they were worse so. Save Marvel!"
514,6,"Bad reviews are good news I read loads of IDBM reviews on Eternals. Most of them were bad. ""Too long and slow""; ""too much walking and talking and standing and talking"" etc I really was put off even bothering to watch it.But the good news about bad reviews? They lower your expectations.I did watch it in the end, mostly just so I could say I'd given it a chance.And I *DID* enjoy it.Yes, it's long (maybe too long) And yes it can be slow, in places. But this is the first movie setting up the story of a whole new set of characters - a whole set of characters, not just the usual ONE new hero. It's going to take time to give us a bit of backstory before the kick-ass action comes in.Personally I enjoyed Eternals. Possibly BECAUSE my expectations were so low thanks to all the bad reviews.But I'd say, get yourself a large packet of popcorn, bottle of wine, or whatever your viewing companion is, and give it a go.""The Eternals will return..."", so you'd just as we'll get introduced to them now.Oh and that oh so trumpeted ""first gay kiss""?It's an established couple kissing each other goodbye FGS. Is that really still 'controversial' or even noteworthy in the 21st century?"
515,3,"Eternally dull I wanted to like this, but wow what a boring, long, dull movie. I wish I could find something nice to say but I can't. There was really nothing enjoyable about this, even the actors appeared bored and uninterested."
516,3,"The one time I wish there was more studio oversight Chloé Zhao may be a fantastic director & writer for deep introspective dramas but there is nothing in her background to warrant taking on such a hefty epic comic-based action flick and it is extremely apparent with the final product.Did no one at Disney think they could tell her ""No""?It is painfully slow. There is no momentum whatsoever.Forget spoon feeding exposition, Chloé Zhao shoved that sludge down our throats no matter how much we tried to spit it out.50 minutes could easily be left of the cutting room floorEven then the script is a mess. It is almost like Chloé Zhao tried to write a heartfelt drama with action scenes wedge in between plot points."
517,1,"Not the worst MCU entry Flat characters, no character development, bad script, the action choreography is dull and the action scenes are boring. Signs of bad acting throughout the entire movie."
518,10,Very interesting and different I like how this movie has so many characters and still is able to put them together over thousands of years' history. There are questions and plot holes but overall it's pretty complete and fresh. I would love to watch again.
519,2,"Marvel finally dropped the ball. I have been waiting for this day for a long time. Marvel have finally released not just a bad movie, but a horrible one. Eternals feels like an eternity, horrible writing, predictable character tropes, and just creates so many questions with zero answers. It's basically Gods catching feelings and stressing about it for nearly 3 hours. And the fact that the end credits says Eternals will return right after Harry Styles shows up? Nah man. Eternals 2 may be the first MCU movie I actually skip hey."
520,7,"Confusing, average but relevant. There are many reviews to this movie already so I will jump straight to the conclusion without using any fancy ""critical"" wording and epithets.This movie is at best okay.Reasoning behind that rating is purely based on the story.Story follows ""eternals"", which in my opinion are the most boring and standard ""superheroes"" to date, I am a big fan of Marvel and superhero genre in general, but I am yet to discover a interesting superhero in this movie.Plot twist was interesting and ending post-credit scenes really opened up a redemption opportunity for this movie.In short, this movie is worth a watch if you are a marvel fan, and want to see upcoming movies such as ""Blade"" and Guardians of Galaxy III, It contains some beautiful visuals, fighting scenes and a decent plot twist.Whatsoever story could be richer, wide variety of talented actors were very limited in this movie and soundtrack wasn't that impressive.Overall 7/10, relevant for MCU storyline, bit confusing but still a decent movie, worth a watch."
521,10,"Bravo for the diversity I'm not usually a Marvel fan, but I was surprise to enjoy this one. I liked the images and the story, it made me laugh and I really appreciated the fact that there is a lot of diversity shown. 👏"
522,4,Dumb story writing I assume this was a comic they tried to merge in the MCU.Not all comics should be made into a movie.It was weird Jolie had such a bit part.Casting was a head scratcher.
523,1,"It's like COVID...Just never ends! Rambling and incoherent story that was just painful to sit through. Fast forwarded through much of it. Very stiff acting from most of the cast. Weird cinematography and camera work. CGI was just okay.On the upside, suggestion of Black Knight and Blade gives some hope."
524,10,"Who the hell writes these reviews!? (NO SPOILERS) So, first of all, don't listen to the critics.I went into this with very low expectations because of all the negative reviews. After watching it for the first time I am starting to think all those people are completely tasteless.Addressing some of the critics I have red:1. Characters aren't relatable... Oh really, so you can relate to a 12 foot green ""Bigfoot"" and a super smart billionaire with his own power armor but this is too much?? It's a superhero movie for crying out loud!2. Not funny... I am sorry you were born without humor. It's one of the funnier Marvel's I've seen.3. It's overreaching... Yes it's called expanding the franchise. We have had our typical superheroes and tones of content like it. After ""End Game"" it makes perfect sense they are heading in this direction. Exploring more of the universe and looking at the MCU on a broader scale.4. Tooo long... Nope, it's perfect. They take the time to cover the relationships between the different Eternals over a time span of thousands of years. To make sure we get the full picture and get to know them. So nope, not to long. It's a MOVIE.5. VFX look poor... Yeah, those are just some spoiled people. Not even worth mentioning.6. It raises more questions than it awnsers... Again, this is because we are expanding the franchise. It's part of the fun you know. And if you watched till the end you'd know the ""Eternals"" are returning.7. I could go on but I think you get my point.All in all pretty solid movie. Loved the actors and music as well. Only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because they keep their suits on for to long, at the beginning of the movie. Makes them feel out of place sometimes. But again they are Eternal so what do I know.Can't wait to see how this will fit in with the ""Guardians of the galaxy"" if they decided to move in that direction. And to all my sweet reviewers out there, remember it's only my personal opinion. Nothing personal.Much love."
525,2,"Terrible I'm still in shock! I was so excited to see what Marvel is introducing after Avengers, but it was a complete disaster. Although the movie was bombarded by famous actors, the storyline couldn't be worse and more disengaging. I literally stopped after watching it for 20 mins. As usual the cinematic features are fantastic but it was lacking many things with regards to the story. The only thing that I'm happy about is that I didn't go to the movies for this dire film."
526,2,"Running time: Eternal. Did anyone actually enjoy making this film? Dour, stale vibes throughout. Nothing like what one would expect from a Marvel film. Harry Styles provides arguably the most entertaining bit at the end but the poor lad was about 135 minutes too late. If there's a sequel, I won't be watching it."
527,8,"More complex than it seems I postponed watching Eternals due to several reviews.I actually was not only pleasantly surprised, but found myself imersed in the story. It is definitely a plus the diverse characters, their backgrounds and the fact that there is no lead. I think all the characters had a good part in building the story which makes it even more easy to ""pick your favourite "" or relatable one.I do share other reviews as in, the beginning seemed too slow moving and full of cliché scenes. But once the story pivks up, it moves better.Definatelly not the standard action/superhero film, but highly liked it and I do hope for a part 2."
528,1,"Painful The best thing about going to the cinema to see this film ... with all the lockdown and un-lockdown, snip-snap, snip-snap, snip-snap, we've all had to put up with ... over the last couple of years ... was hearing the booming soundtrack, from a certain 10-out-of-10 sci-fi re-make film playing in the adjacent cinema theatre next door, booming through and shaking the walls of this theatre! This film story was do-able in 5 minutes as an episode of a certain TV time-travelling, lord. But ... hmmm ... what was/is the point in it? Sorry!"
529,1,The WORST marvel movie to date This movie is a complete time waster from beginning to end. How can a Marvel movie with such a great cast be this bad? The movie is very slow moving and boring. Some of the special effects mimic something of a low quality video game.
530,1,"Accent plus weird Lovestory They lived for 7000+ years but still can't Master the english Language without an accent. Plus The Lovestory of Ikaris and that girl where really random. Why would Fanta betray her best friend for someone who looks 2x older plus has a Irish accent. And why is the main character helping everyone and nearly kissing Ikaris after he tried to kill her and end humanity for someone he has never met. Another irritating thing, is that there are around 2784 Fights against super strong villains could have made the movie 1 hour shorter and it would have been better."
531,7,"Entertaining! What's up with all the overcritical reviews? Why can't a movie such as this, simply be entertaining? I found the visuals to be outstanding and the story was simple to follow. The range of actors was a pleasant surprise and director Chloe Zhao did an impressive job for such a mammoth-scale production."
532,4,Short story long And that's it's problem. It's a series of short stories that may have been better as a tv show. But even then this disjointed storyline is so broken up it's pointless.
533,6,"It had potential, just not realized. I saw some reviews by critic stating it was philosophical, deep, but not actioned packed. They were right with one of those. It brings up philosophical topics where if they actually went with it I would have gave it a star more but... take for example one of the eternals has a kid, it doesn't go that much into what it means to be a parent instead he decided to risk everything for a kid. No real reason why but just because a kid, no motivation for saving the Kid other than a kid existing."
534,1,More shocking than how bad the movie was ... Much more shocking than how a marvel movie could be this bad was the fact that anyone gave it any kind of review that was better than simply atrocious Errrrr still trying to figure out Salma Hayek being cast. All the virtue signalling was nauseating- please-we go to the movies for pure escapism when it comes to a marvel movie.
535,5,"Great potential that it doesn't live up to. When you see the cast list, you think that it's going to be great. However, the writing is poor and the acting is pretty much at the same level. Very disappointing and I'm wondering if this is the moment that the MU has jumped the shark. On the plus side, the cinematography is excellent."
536,5,"Hard to make out Eternals is a 2021 Sci fi superhero movie featuring an all star cast from Angelina Jolie(Maleficent) ,Richard Madden (Cinderella and GOT),Kit Harrington(also on Game Of Thrones with Richard Madden),Salma Hayek(Desperado),Barry Keouaghan(Love Hate), and Gemma Chan(Human).A group of aliens dubbed The Eternals are sent to Earth after 7,000 years to protect humankind from the deviants. When one of the deviants kills one of their people, its up to the rest of them to stop the deviants before I too late.From its all star cast to its action sequences, Eternals is a very average superhero flick. The execution is boring and the CGI is noticeable. I gotta give this film probs for having a deaf actress playing a superhero. I wanted to turn it off after the hour mark but I decided to keep watching it just to see will it get any better. Sadly it got worse by each scene.5.5/10 C."
537,10,"Can't wait for the second one !!! Yes it is that good! Bring on the second one!!! Loved everything about it, great casting! Those who didn't like it, maybe should watch it again? Thank all the crew that worked hard on this, you guys made a great film!"
538,2,"It's so dark!? I gave up, I really wanted to watch this film. But the scenes are so dark I can barely see what's going on. Thought it's my tv setting, but just as bad on iPad and iPhone. Shame as I'd have probably enjoyed it."
539,1,Just didn't deliver This movie not only doesn't create any ability to connect with the characters. It also destroyed a lot of previous MCU plot integrity. Best to leave it out of the box set:/
540,1,"Worst production, a nonsense product I got a list of worst movies I watched, and this Eternal of course is in that small list.What a waste of time.I writer producer and makes should first decide who are your audience, a package which is not appropriate for any class will obviously be an epic failure.So is a production for children No, for teens ummm not exactly, for youth well no, for mature audience? Of course not, stupid. Then for who?"
541,5,"cultural appropriation at its best Story makes no sense; characters which supposed to be more than thousands of years old act like teenagers; Hollywood tries to copy Chinese Cinema without their fantasy soul and without philosophy, but stealing from so many different cultures - and destroy these cultures within 2,5 hours; if this is the future of movies - omg please no. Sorry for all the wasted genius actors."
542,3,"The whole movie can be shorten to 1 hour... Well, as usual, some of the Marvel Studios movie is great on trailer, buck sucks on the real movie, & Eternals is one of those...No doubt the CGI's were great, but the flow was too long & too boring...I fall asleep just after 1 hour...No pint of Marvel Studio to drag this movie for so long...quite disappointed..."
543,4,"Average at best This almost felt like The Avengers Endgame, with different characters. It felt like you are starting at the end of the film series, with lots of flashbacks to explain what has happened since the Eternals arrived on earth. The constant flashbacks and the written explanation at the beginning of the film did nothing to endear me to any of the characters. Some of the CGI was a bit ropey. The story felt lazy. The Creator of the Eternals looked the robot from the children's film The Iron Giant.At one point one of the Eternals casually wonders what the rest of the Avengers are doing since the loss IronMan etc at the end of events in Endgame. You may well wonder the same as none are anywhere to be seen in this potential end of world story set after Endgame.And there were far too many references to love, family, relationships, etc, that really shows that Disney are now the owners of Marvel. For me this is now three strikes in a row for Marvel, The Black Widow. Shang-Chi, and now this. Just like the comics did, Marvel have seen their best days, and are slowly dying by introducing more and more so called superhero's with sub standard, or seen it all before stories."
544,5,I fell asleep...enough said Sooooo boring. Too many characters not enough character development. The final boss battle was so lame I fell asleep half way through. Rewatching didn't help.
545,4,"Bland, uninspired, mail-in performances Every now and then a movie comes along which when you watch it you simply cannot connect with the suspension of disbelief.. This film felt completely contrived and formulaic. The casting was one of those situations where you're expected to be wowed by by big name stars instead of the story they are intended to represent. Nothing about the characters felt genuine for me, just walk thru, say your lines artifice. A pathetic insult to reasonably intelligent viewers. Sick of the MCU money grab. 👎"
546,5,Why Unless this movie has some connection to the future MCU(didn't wait for the after credits scene if there was one)I don't understand why this movie was made. It was funny. I mean that positively. The action scenes were unnecessary and boring. Lots of good actors. But the movie just didn't work.
547,5,"This is a rip-off of ""The Old Guard"" Was not a bad movie, but was about 30 minutes too long and jumped back and forth in time way too much. This could have been a good movie, but the entire time I was watching this I was thinking that I had just seen a very similar movie. I was right, this was a rip-off of The Old Guard. Marvel could have done so much more with this movie. Worth watching if you are an MCU fan."
548,3,Awful mess Like most other reviewers I was soooo disappointed in this after all the hype and the big names. What a complete mess of a film. The story had potential and clearly the actors involved should have helped but what a mess the story is. Way too long for the drivel that it is. Did not the money people see it for what it wasn't?
549,3,"A black spot for MCU So Marvel should just forget this and move on, considering how badly this movie was made. Inconsistent plots, poor action sequences, I mean ,this is not something you would expect from Marvel movie. The addition of the Indian, (speaking English in a native dialect) was unnecessary and didn't serve any useful purpose. It's funny how none of the Eternals can manage their own in a fight and always have to depend on Ikarus. Ajak and Gilgamesh has in fact a whole lot of superpowers which weren't portrayed in their movie version."
550,6,"Could easily have been excellent. This film has stunning visuals, great action scenes and a few compelling character moments which for me came from Druig and Phastos. However, we don't spend much time on those character.In fact we don't spend much time with any of them except Ikarus and Sersi. We spend far too much time on their relationship, which feels like it slows down the entire movie, and virtually no time on the relationship they all have with each other as a group.This makes it hard establish their personalities, how they feel about one another, how they work together and how they handle splitting up.Ultimately all that means is that most of the emotional beats with these character simply don't hit, which isn't the most awful thing in the world but if you want a excellent movie we need to feel all of the characters all the way through."
551,5,"Some good points but mostly confusing and awful Points to marvel/disney for the genuinely solid disabled and lgbt rep, but this movie was a mess. The weird abortion metophor as a plot was uncomfortable and the amount of racist rhetoric involving helping early civilizations ""evolve"" is frankly unacceptable. Not to mention they had a subplot where a character who is a child (I don't care about mental age and neither should you) is in love with an adult man and commits acts of violence on his behalf. Would not recommend to an audience who is not interested in critically consuming media, they may come out of the experience with some warped opinions of what is and isn't okay."
552,1,dont even know where to begin Lame premise Too many characters so none are developed Flat bland characters so I couldnt be invested into the boo hoo drama.So boring i couldnt finish Bad acting Story was stupid.Is there no consequences for putting out plainly a really expensive and bad movie other than shame?
553,4,"Hit And a Miss I think Marvel stretched themselves too far on this one. I mean, they had me in the first half but I still was waiting for it to get better. Instead, the next hour and a half let me down a dark path with characters we really couldn't care about, their backstories non-existent or simply pointless because they've just been alive to unbelievably long.Sure the CGI was incredible, the creature design was unique, the visuals just wow, but the pacing-- switching back and forth from different eras destroyed any hope of a purpose.Weird decisions were made like unessesary inclusions of controversial scenes, failed jokes, and confusing casting... It just felt, uncomfortable.And why the heck did Harry Styles show up?"
554,4,"Good but boring Good action movie and story. Just found me sell more interested in my cat, just almost pointless movie. Just note very interesting. Just go watch Wayne's worlds way better movie."
555,1,"Even DC would be laughing at how poorly executed this was. Best part of the movie was watching the Marvel intro and getting all the feels of your favourite superheroes. Reminiscing of a world you couldn't help but love and fear the day it all ended. Well that day has well and truely arrived... Together we have been rudely awakened by a movie that claims to be the next evolution of the Marvel universe movies, except it's not. Not even close. The first 30 minutes of poorly executed storyline, character development and editing blunders? Is then followed by more of the last 30 minutes. From actors and actresses that have past their used by date, to absolutely stuffing up the once upon a time, well crafted villains - the ones you used to hate but almost sympathise with as their character development had depth and purpose. If I was to sum up this movie in two words it would be... yawn, followed by trash. Maybe the Other way around? Even DCs infamous Martha line tops this movie. And that's saying something."
556,3,"Falling asleep as we speak Seriously - This movie is not exciting to me and I like super hero stuff. But not this one. Too much of a good thing, maybe? Great diversity in the cast.But not enough of a story, really. It seems to be a vanity project for almost everyone except the audience.It flip flops back and forth far too often. After 38 minutes I am totally lost - and I don't care where we are anymore because I am outta here! I don't care about the characters, certainly not Ikaris. He's the most fleshed out of the group maybe because he is a love 'em and leave 'em klnda guy - that I really don't like at all so am wondering why everyone else is so stupid to fall for him!! All I know is, I cannot put any more time into this overly complex yet shallow tale of yet more superheros littering the movie galaxy.This movie makes Green Lantern look like an Emmy Winner.Time for a good book. Or The Simpsons. Anything else to wake me up."
557,1,it's not a marvel movie It seems to me Marvel has been making movies just for money and they don't care of the story and the character of actors.The last amiossing movie was the black widow marvel is dieing.
558,6,"6.5 6.5 I really like the art in the movie, wish I could see these on imax screen. I love BDO in that and the gold big hand. But the story is plane just like water, I can't taste anything. I can see the director want to keep her own style but it's not successful."
559,6,60 minutes longer than it needed to be. The movie looks really good but the pacing is very slow and there's at least an hour of scenes that could be cut out. The aspect ratio changes several dozen times during the movie and it's very distracting.
560,5,"Generic Marvel at its most generic It's not really worth going into the plot of Eternals. It's the usual comic mish-mash of a simplistic plot made overly convoluted, with plenty of excess baggage from the previous MCU films.It's not actually as bad as I expected, but that really isn't to say it's great or even good. It's not the worst MCU film, either. There's a dash of the usual humour, which is often the only saving grace after the eye-candy special effects. This instance isn't any different, with possibly a little less humour.Kumail Nanjiani as 'Kingo', and his sidekick, provide said comic relief, and oddly enough their setup probably makes them the most interesting characters. A story about the two of them filming his heroic exploits to promote his movie career would be far more fun and amusing than the rest of the movie.Beyond that, the rest of the cast are all a bit bland. The 'romance' between Gemma Chan's 'Sersi' and Richard Madden's 'Ikarus' has zero chemistry, and thus leaves all the emotional melodrama a bit flat, for the conclusion. Lia McHugh's 'Sprite' is a lacklustre attempt at the frustrations and difficulties of Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia', in 'Interview with the Vampire' without any of the bite (pun intended).Angelina Jolie doesn't have a great deal to do, but she does her usual posterior-kicking well. The remaining characters barely register, although it has to be mentioned how truly awful bad Barry Keoghan's accent. At first I thought he was an American trying to do a bad Irish accent, but it turned out to be the other way around!Considering the big fuss about Oscar winner Chloé Zhao directing, it didn't feel particularly different to other MCU films, just a bit more ponderous. It certainly didn't have the epic scope and atmosphere it should have had for a film of this type. Compare what Highlander manages with fewer 'eternal' characters and a fraction of the budget in the 80s, from both an emotional perspective and that of being an immortal passing through time.Ultimately, it just feels like another long MCU trailer to tease its next movie, which will in turn be a trailer for the next, and so on..."
561,1,"Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner has a better plot and storyline So, you can grow a celestial in the earths core and birth it out of the sea. Wouldn't the seismic activity alone register '10' on the Richter scale, enough to disrupt the earths magnetic field and cause city-drowning tsunamis?Yet the entire Avengers team were taking a time-out during this global cataclysmic event, and 7,000 years is not long enough for this fraternity (The Eternals) to bond - avoid betrayal and kill one another due to 'trust' issues? It was at this point I thought, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner has a better plot and storyline."
562,1,"Watered-down ""LOVE"" narrative I started with a 5/10 for great visuals. When Ikaris told Sersi she was beautiful and they kissed, I removed a star. When they said they loved each other on the FIRST ""mating"" scene, I removed two more stars. These scenes couldn't be further from reality. This hollywood ""love"" brainwashing is why you see so many WEAK, PATHETIC beta males in our society. And this garbage mainstream narratives for love are far from empowering WOMEN too."
563,4,"Could be much better.... .....if the movie would be not that long. Remove all the jokes (most of them are not funny) and all the unnecessary blahblah. 100 minutes would ne perfect. Then it is still not as good as other marvel movies, but it would be not that boring."
564,4,"What was that? I was hyped for this movie and couldn't wait! Once it was on Disney plus I was able to find some time to watch it. What I didn't know was, is that I would need over 2 and half hours of free time just to get let down. This film was all over the place at a snails pace. I remember pausing halfway through and thinking, damn, when is something going to actually happen. The main characters felt like they were in a daze or just didn't want to do it. Angelina was the only actor that felt like they were trying. This movie was a complete and total letdown, perhaps the worst in the entire MCU. I love the story of the eternals, just not this iteration."
565,5,"Worst MCU movie Probably the worst MCU movie for me. Characters uninteresting. The story didn't interest me either and was a bit poorly presented here and there as it jumped around to the past and then to the present and was a bit of a goulash for me. The action wasn't bad, but there wasn't much of it, and especially it wasn't good enough to keep the film at 2 and a half hours. Like I said. The action wasn't bad, but Endgame set the bar high and this was definitely weaker than that. To sum it up. The movie itself wasn't even all that spectacular in my opinion, and when you add in the fact that this is the third Marvel movie and that the previous ones were great, this is a pretty big downer for me. I'm disappointed. The thing that scares me the most about this is that this probably isn't the only movie and there will be a second installment. Who knows? Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. But for now, I'm not looking forward to it at all and I wouldn't see it as a series. For me, a mediocre movie that I don't recommend and if anything, really only to the biggest Marvel fans."
566,4,Very Forgetable This is the most forgettable movie I have ever seen.While watching it I thought it was rather enjoyable but after thinking about it a bit more I realized that this was because i sat down and just turned my brain off.I watched it slightly over a month ago and have forgotten almost all everything about this film despite it being 2 and a half hours long.This is a very disappointing movie.
567,4,Boring Initially I thought this movie might be interesting but it is quite boring..I can't imagine such movie from MCU with so many characters................ Better watch end game or doctor strange.
568,8,"A worth watch While it's not important to have any comic book knowledge, it's helpful to have a little to have especially for the end credit scenes. Plus, Angelina Jolie fit her role as Thena and Kumail Nanjiani (from Silicone Valley fame) and his business associate (Karun) played by Harish Patel play of each other perfectly. While not in the movie for long, Kit Harington was surprisingly fun and fun to watch. I'd finished it unexpectedly delighted with how the suspense was built and the tone of music throughout the movie. I would go back and watch multiple times. As well as recommend to my friends/family."
569,1,"Underperforms in almost all areas This is easily the worst marvel movie, and one of the worst films in general that I have seen in a long time.The story is poorly told, the acting sub par from most of the cast, the dialogue stilted, badly written, poorly delivered, (the actors seemed not to believe in what they were saying). The director has to carry the can for this disastrous movie. Whatever they're vision was, they failed to deliver it, even with some notable talent...who frankly gave they're worst performances...it is a mess from beginning to end. I had heard it was not great, but wanted to give it a chance, I'm sorry I did and I think you will be sorry too."
570,2,"Marvel don't go backwards anymore Marvel is just losing my interest somehow, weak movie after the other but let me focus on this one for now. The wooden acting, the bad directing, poor fighting scenes, the movie us everywhere.They had such great talented staff in this one but did they use any of their acting talents .. nooo And to start with having 2 actors from Game of Thrones fall in love with the same female whose name is SERSI what!!Alot of weird things in this movie takes your head away from thinking about the movie itself and try to understand the references.I don't recommend watching this movie just save your time and watch something worth it."
571,3,"Marvel style fever dream The most campy superhero film I've seen in a long time, not in a good way. The main character Cersei was giving me green lantern vibes with her outfit and her acting. Druig was the only ""hero"" with an interesting and believing internal conflict. If this took place in a world without avengers I'd maybe have been able to get into it a little more."
572,1,Terrible What has happened to marvel this cannot be the direction they are going in surely after the success of the avengers/individuals character films and guardians this is a total flop for me.
573,8,"Unlike the other 'critics' I enjoyed the movie Let's get one thing out of the way first; not every superhero movie is going to be The Dark Knight. Having said that, this movie was fun. I didn't mind the runtime and was never bored. The special effects were good. The comic bits were decent. Overall it was what I've come to expect from a Marvel Universe movie.And the final bit with Kit Harrington makes me excited for the second installment.Don't listen to the bad reviews, if you are looking for a fun movie do give it a try."
574,5,"A poor Marvel film It was too long . Too much back ground information at the start of the film . It needed to lose 30 minutes . Sadly the story was pretty grim . I would rather have the Avengers looking after us than this lot of questionable "" heroes"" . However it had some light hearted moments to relieve the mood of the story . All round .....a bit of a flop and far from enjoyable ."
575,4,"Disappointing At the end of the day, the most boring storyline and plot ever! The actors and acting was good, it is just the concept is really bland. Interesting that there are also a few DC references outside the Avengers references. But at the end a very disappointing probably the worse MCU movies ever!"
576,6,"Too much pity. Literary Marvel movies. Excuse me. Because my English is not good. The text is expressed with translation software. The About movie expects too much and disappoints. The film has enough time to narrate but because the pace is too slow. It's basically impossible to describe each role in more detail. When the character chooses which side. The sudden blackening is too abrupt. Thena's character was described as strong but didn't see the expected play out. The picture of finally preventing success reminds me of the picture of Evangelion. The ending part will make people look forward to how the next episode will develop. Only the ending of the whole play is what makes people look forward to it! ? Of course I think the director wants to give the audience a different Marvel movie. However, the last film of the Gold Award director was very different from the Marvel theme. I was worried about whether the movie was too literary. Does the result fit in with the expression that people like today's Marvel movies?"
577,4,"MCU's sole abject failure The worst, and only truly bad, MCU movie. I've seen all of them more than once, some of them a bunch of times, and I can't imagine sitting through this one again. It took me 3 and 1/2 hours to get through it because I kept getting up out of sheer boredom to start the dishwasher, let the dog out, watch some paint dry, all of which was more interesting than most of this movie.It's difficult to enumerate the problems with The Eternals because there are so many. With the exception of special effects it fails on every level. Right from the start we are dropped into a pointless flashback structure, which starts in the middle of things. Beginning in medias res has worked in other movies (Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best examples), but here, instead of creating a sense of mystery or suspense, it is just confusing and tedious. We're dumped into the middle of fight sequences with characters we don't know and with whom we've established no connection. Even the humor in the first part of the movie falls flat because the movie hasn't earned those laughs. So much of the humor in the MCU is rooted in character development, and there is literally none of that for the first half of the movie, and precious little for the duration.We are subjected to boring romantic subplots involving characters we don't care about, and soulless melodrama between same. There have been a couple of similar missteps, most notably in Age of Ultron, but the MCU has never simply given itself over to this kind of tedium. (I can't help but use tedium/tedious repeatedly. It's one of the defining characteristics of this flick.)Even most of the action sequences are tedious. I know some people think the action sequences in some MCU movies go on too long, but I have never found them simply boring until now.Fittingly, the score is also uninteresting, and with a terrible electric guitar component that just does not fit.Following from the ineffectual flashback organization, the plot is convoluted and overblown, with tepid moments of explanatory exposition, and many unearned moments of ""high emotion.""Incredibly, for the first time I can remember there is actually MCU miscasting (Angelina Jolie - I have no problem with her but she doesn't belong in this movie), bland casting (Kit Harington? Snooze. Harry freaking Styles? GMAFB), and even the casting of someone who does not appear to be a particularly good actor (sorry, Lia McHugh - maybe you were just poorly directed and had lame dialogue to work with).Heck, even the mid-credit and end-credit sequences left me cold, thinking, ""Blech. 'Eternals will return...' Who cares?"" I've never left an MCU flick feeling like I do not want to see a sequel to this movie."
578,4,"The MCU does a belly flop and it hurts! I didn't come in to this thinking MCU and though they do mention some of the other MCU characters this story stands alone. Unfortunately it also falls flat at best. Giving it a 4 was being generous as some of the characters are likable up until they are not.They have a lot of talent in the cast but there are so many plot holes that the move just doesn't make any sense. The over all premises of the movie is weakened by the fact this does take place in the MCU but it's never been mentioned before and there are planets far older than Earth that... well I don't want to give anything away but it doesn't match up with the plot.Angelina Jolie's character is just totally lost in the story. It's like they gave her a role then never followed through with it or totally forgot what the stated role was at the start of the film. They just gloss over it in the end and never provide any real follow up to the actually claims made at the start of the film.The film was slow at times and had to do a lot of explaining. Jumping forward and backward in time can greatly benefit some films but in this case it did more to damage the film than help the story along. Many of the jumps came at odd times and seemed to take you to points in time that didn't really further the plot in any meaningful way.And I don't think I am giving anything away here, in that the all the MCU movies have tid bits to where the next story will go but this one left me feeling it was not hopeful it would get any better. In fact the closing scenes fell flatter than the movie and I felt they should cancel the sequels now before they really stick there foot in it."
579,2,"Complacent, slow and boring I found Marvel movies in the past reliably entertaining. Quality special effects, solid plot and useful sideline stories, sufficiently developed characters and nicely crafted/well timed jokes. No more. The recent productions coming out from the Disney-owned franchise are basket cases. High on that list is this movie, the Eternals. The plot is incredibly patchy and poorly edited. Too many characters are being thrown in this movie without being given a chance of getting off the ground. Doesn't matter if they are all established and talented stars. The material is just not there. The rhythm is far too slow. So many moments wasted on totally futile sequences. So the movie stretches senselessly, almost eternally, until those 2hrs+ are gone forever, leaving a taste of enormous waste."
580,10,"One of my favourites in this MCU phase. Love it!It was brilliant as it was complex.Everyone in the film gave a brilliant performance, the script was well put together and it didn't feel like a 3hr movie!10/10."
581,6,"It was....something. It was....something. I'm late and everybody must have already watched it, so I'll keep it short.Visually stunning! That Celestial scene was 🔥 Good acting and action choreography - whatever limited action the movie had. For my liking - too much going on for a single movie. Lose ends. Couldn't get behind the characters much. This might have been a good two-part movie, maybe an 8 ep tv show? It was a decent movie, not sure if everyone enjoyed it as much as they'd enjoy a regular MCU movie.Expectations for Marvel movies have become SO HIGH because they build up on 10 yrs' worth of storytelling. To drop a movie about a bunch of superheroes story when people have been used to the build up, dunno how to feel about it. Decent nevertheless."
582,4,"Eternal potential ruined by painfully finite directorial skills. Pros:good source materialgood effectsgood cinematographygood actors (for the most part)good charactersCons:This movie had far more potential than was realized. The director (who also wrote the screenplay) has been described as ""up and coming,"" honestly I hope she is ""down and leaving.""Unless they make her walk the plank before they make the sequel, I fear this ship may sink.I did like the Death Star hidden in the hieroglyphics in the end credits though."
583,6,"Encumbered by its own weight - would have made a better series Wow what a cast - looks like the director got their dream cast. What comes out however is a very unsuper hero movie that lacks the usual Marvel touch. The movie was encumbered by too wide a cast with not enough time to develop relatively shallow eternally living characters. Lots of hope, humanity and diversity in the script however despite promising elements it just struggled for connection and impact. For ancient beings they weren't too bright, still however there was a lot to like, I feel a series would have provided the much needed room for its potential. Enjoyable and great cast but struggled to be compelling despite some great scenes and potential."
584,3,"Fun Premise, Great Visual, Slow Development, Weak Ending. Fun Premise: The idea of there being Eternals on the Earth that have been part of our history ... from Sumeria to Greece to India etc... I think is a fun story line, and they set it up really well.Good Effects: The special effects were good, the visuals are fun. High quality production, fun to watch from a visual point of view.Slow Development: After a nice start, then it got messy. I think trying to give us the back stories of so many characters ended up muddling everything. The story seems to jump back and forth and was somehow lacking. Everyone was shallow because we only got a snippet of their story.Disappointing End: {SPOILERS} That they are all robots was kind of weak, and their response was very flat. Athena being broken so all she does is stand around leaning on a tree looking sad is horribly disappointing. Somehow ""stoning"" the celestial in the end was lame. THEN the other Celestial shows up and kind of muddies the waters at best.... either wipe them out for killing a celestial or whatever... what is he going to judge?So .... first 30 to 45 minutes was, I think, a 7 or 8 ... last half was at best a 2 ... averages out to a 4 in my mind."
585,8,"Good. Not spendid. Got that 'marvel-feel'. Just enjoy and don't think. The film as a whole is actually quite good I'd say. The action scenes and CGI are very well done and surely entertaining. However the plot does not make a lot of sense to me. Lots of characters, human or something else, just dont need to be in the movie at all for it to work. Besides that a lot of the choices that the main characters make just don't seem logical. They're thousands of years old and still they're heavily influenced by impulses, emotions and beliefs. And yet when those very beliefs are challenged most show little to no actual reaction. It is also odd that a god programmed them to not be able to evolve, yet they did. For example, upon finding out that Olympia had never even existed and that they were programmed and had their memories erased constantly, they fairly quickly reasoned it is ok to resist their god like creator. Now If they can do that with such little effort I'd say Arishem was a fairly poor programmer who made the same mistake twice (deviants also evolved). Anyway I guess they will explain to us in Eternals 2 why all of that happened. 8/10 definitely a fun marvel movie to watch."
586,1,"Seriously! (Sersi) This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's just really boring, the characters are rubbish and the plot is weird (monsters vs aliens, come on Marvel, ffs!)If you substitute 'Sersi' for 'seriously' it's funny, and something that automatically happened for me, which maybe didn't help with my opinion of the film.I was told it gets better, that's the only reason I finished it, and it doesn't. Pants. Interestingly I lasted 45 minutes of Nomadland (Oscar winner for best film) before turning it off, which has the same director, so maybe it's just me! Haha!"
587,10,"Marvel should already be commended Marvel should already be commended for trying to break away from the traditional formula for producing successful content that many are already fed up with and allowing Chloe Zhao to make a slower and more conversational than action superhero movie. However, having put on their shoulders more than they can carry, the ""Eternals"" eventually fall off their feet, not even reaching the middle of the path. The Oscar winner clearly lacked the experience to fit the cumbersome mythology of new characters into one picture. The narrative is lengthy, and the addition of an LGBT agenda and the first sex scene in the MCU looks like a show-off on the part of Disney, an attempt to show its ""advancement"". Remove these scenes and the film will not be worse for sure. Fortunately, at least top actors and a cameraman with special effects artists, as well as individual bright scenes brighten up these ""eternal everyday life"", otherwise everything could have been even more hopeless. But still I have to admit that the first experimental pancake turned out to be rather lumpy than successful."
588,10,"Even a day after watching it Even a day after watching it, I have no idea how to feel about the film. On the one hand, the creators clearly had ambitions and in some scenes the scale is quite felt, the characters are interesting and well revealed, and the director's style distinguishes the Eternals from most Marvel projects. But on the other hand, from a screenplay point of view, the movie is clearly not smooth, interfering with many moments in the MCU, the characters, just as heroes, and not as individuals, are secondary, the action and technical component are not impressive, and most of the potentially interesting ideas have not been properly disclosed. . This is the case when it is difficult to say in the end whether the film is definitely good or definitely bad. Perhaps that is why the Eternals divided the audience so strongly into those who protect it and those who drown it. Probably, this is the same film with which everything will become clear only with time. Only in time will we understand if the film was able to turn Marvel in a new direction, or completely sunk it."
589,10,"A rather risky and ambitious project A rather risky and ambitious project, which, in the case of converged stars and other fortunate circumstances, could become a turning point in the MCU. In fact, this is what he turned out to be, but most viewers (especially fans) are not happy with this. Yes, the story here is different, there are no usual formations of characters, and the GG is not opposed by villains with identical abilities. Non-linear narrative breaks the harmony of the film, but you get used to it easily. And by the beginning of the credits, you understand what, why and why these scenes were shown and in that sequence. If the film is scolded, then only for a number of questions and illogicalities that it leaves behind. But they scolded the conditional Raganarok for the same thing or for much bigger problems, God forgive me, the Finale? Not! The vast majority were delighted. Here, if desired, you can find logical answers to many questions. And now briefly for the rest: the actors are chosen well and play well. Inclusiveness does not strain the eyes and is quite self-explanatory. And white and heterosexual men are shown to us even more than we expected from the first promo. Each hero has his own story arc and his own moments of glory. Problems can only arise with remembering names. The main plus of the film is the presence of any eggs from the scriptwriters, who for once brought plot twists to the MCU (a little more than one) and showed a real confrontation between the characters not for life, but for death, in contrast to the children's brawls in ""The First Avenger 3."" Lots and lots of details. The music is interesting and stands out from its predecessors for the better. Chloe Zhao - well done and coped with the task perfectly. Working with the material given to her, she embodied the maximum. Claims already to these same suppliers. P. S. I'm waiting for the sequel, and I will definitely go to the cinema if it takes place."
590,7,"Enjoyable, Universal Farmers, Circle of Life... I enjoyed this. It was long, but fun to watch.At first I thought Jolie wasn't a good cast, but she really fits in well. Also, I've never seen the Eternals, so I don't have any preconceived notions... That being said- it is essentially a movie about ""Universal Farmers"" who make universes only so they can reproduce. Interesting concept- do the needs of the ""many"" (those living) on an existing Planet outweigh the needs of a whole other Galaxy (maybe many more)?The Eternals are essentially ""farm hands"" on a super-advanced and Universal scale that help ""farm planets"" for their bosses.""Fun"" part is, I have really no idea who is right and wrong here, killing a ""baby"" universe creator or letting the planet perish so another can be born and hence give birth to more galaxies and more civilizations... Bottom line: everything is food for something else, my guess is even the beings at the very top as well.Monumental ""circle of life"" movie..."
591,5,"Print More than two years have passed since the release of the Final. And it feels like in that movie, Tony Stark's click turned the Marvel universe itself into dust: most of the old and well-revealed characters have disappeared, and the new ones that appear are too faceless to replace them. But the studio's luggage will be enough for a couple of dozen more films, because old Stan and the company have been working on their world for more than half a century. A huge number of different characters and events taking place. However, cinema and the public demand epicness and grandiosity, and therefore trumps immediately come into play: the conversation about Celestials has been going on since the beginning of the second phase, but they really appeared to the world only now. A bid for success or another step into the abyss?"
592,8,"Interesting movie The acting is top notch. The camera work is fascinating, and most importantly, the events take place in the realities known to us - we clearly imagine that this could or could still happen. The future is moving forward by leaps and bounds - progress does not stand still, and who knows, perhaps such Eternals will actually appear, each of whom will have to go his own philosophical path, will have to decide what to do, where to go and how to live on."
593,5,"Trivially A dull and predictable plot, the presence of the flawed and offended for the sake of fashion.When I started watching this picture, I did not expect anything supernatural or something new, and as usual with films from the Marvel film studio, it turned out to be right.Plot: the authors of the script decided not to break the tradition and, as usual, took the path of least resistance, there are heroes, there are villains, they are fighting each other for the fate of all mankind. The plot revolves around the fact that a certain deity sends detachments of superheroes endowed with superpowers to protect intelligent life on different planets from evil predatory creatures remotely resembling ancient lizards, which they almost successfully cope with, but it turns out that the main characters fought absolutely the wrong evil and the main battle they are ahead. The first hour of the film is mostly banal chatter and shots telling about previous events, but towards the end there is an increase in the intensity of events up to an epic massacre of good and evil. The plot does not carry a global mystery and everything is clear from the very beginning, and small plot twists are guessed even before the viewer sees them. And judging by the finale, the audience will be fed one more, and maybe several films on the topic.Actors were called eminent and popular, due to this and, of course, well-applied special effects, films of this kind leave.Summing up, I can say that this film is one-time and there is no desire to revise its desire, but I can only advise fans of special effects to watch it, since there is nothing else to watch."
594,9,"A breakthrough First, the visual is amazing, especially Zhao didn't do very much green screen, we can see modern London and ancient Babylon, those are huge and impressed, it fits the huge background story of Eternals. Not many fight scene, but I can deal with that.The main theme of the story is all about Arishem, is God always right? The story actual speaks more than that, but I'm not gonna say it right here. I think Zhao did an amazing job on developing the characters within 156 minutes runtime.We don't need to argue if this movie is good or not, I think Shang-Chi is old-fashioned, however, the fight scene impressed me. In the meanwhile, I think this movie brings something that other superhero movies cannot bring, maybe it is not exciting as you thought, but is makes you think. In conclusion, I will recommend you to see this, it has its uniqueness."
595,6,"Interesting To be honest, before going to the cinema at the ""Eternal"", I did not entertain myself with any expectations or hopes. Unfortunately, in the last few years, before the release of almost any Marvel studio film, it can very rarely be called ""intriguing"". Yes, you can pick up a lot of other epithets in order to describe your feelings before the premiere of their next tape, but calling the upcoming film ""intriguing"" means that you can expect some surprises from it. This definition does not apply to Marvel films (especially solo ones), because for the most part they are schematic and look like clones performing identical synchronous movements and finally freezing in the same poses. The beginning of the fourth phase is not encouraging yet. I'm not talking about the series, I haven't seen them, but after watching the solo albums about the Black Widow and Shang Chi, the last chapter of the Avengers, which at one time seemed very controversial to me, looks like a fatal beauty who left a big lipstick kiss on her cheek and complete bewilderment from everything,"
596,10,"Forever Eternal The new film from Marvel is certainly worthy of attention, a new veta of events in the life of earthlings, new threats and new heroes. All Marvel fans, everyone who just loves a good movie should definitely watch this movie and remember how as a child you read comics about these heroes, and now the Celestial is standing in front of your eyes and the planet is dying, all this makes The Eternals a great movie."
597,7,Good film This isn't marvels best movie but its getting a lot of hate that it doesn't deserve. Definitely recommend watching it as I thought it was decent. Less action than what we're used to in tge MCA but still a decent amount. So if you're a Marvel fan give it a chance.
598,5,"Just tale And then magic happened, Eternals on Disney streaming. Another entry in the Marvel world. And have seen enough trailers I was ready for it, it looked great but......after one hour I turned this off. On part of the effects it all looked great but what the hell about the story and characters. It's all one boring mess. Nothing happens and when things happens I was thinking, okay, is this it? Fighting against CGI creatures. Not that I have a thing against CGI creatures but it was all lame.The beginning was okay with the history of the world but then it just became one boring love story and as one said, a lifeless flick."
599,6,"Disappointment ""Eternal"" caused nothing but disappointment.But let's go through the points:1. Insanely long movie and minor scenes. It is clear that the director was shooting, to whom heartfelt dramas and scenes of walking by the hand are much more important than a fantastic action (question: why would such a director be trusted to shoot a fantastic blockbuster? Maybe he should do his own thing-shooting soap melodramas with sobbing and moaning of the main characters in each other's arms?)2. The most strikingly terrible thing is the final scenario.Just imagine that, according to the scenario, robots ""Eternal"", designed to protect the celestials (creators of life in the universe), kill such a celestial. And, attention, for what? For the sake of saving planet Earth."
600,8,"Eternal Is good Quite two-fold impressions of the film. We are used to the Avengers or the Justice League as an alternative from another film universe, so when you see a group of superheroes on the screen, you draw parallels. However, the most interesting thing is that in this film everything is so chaotic that it is impossible to single out really good and cool material from this, I will even say more, I think that this film is a ""passer"" in KVM. Even if we make an alternative for the same League, then in this film KVM failed. The film extremely strongly smacks of the failed 2021 series Jupiter's Legacy, both in pitch and mood. The idea was not brought to the ideal, the characters were extremely poorly revealed, and most importantly, in the spirit of KVM, the film began to confuse the viewer, but then there was not even an explanation of how this can be seen in other KVM pictures."
601,6,"About Marvel More than two years have passed since the release of the Final. And it feels like in that movie, Tony Stark's click turned the Marvel universe itself into dust: most of the old and well-revealed characters have disappeared, and the new ones that appear are too faceless to replace them. But the studio's luggage will be enough for a couple of dozen more films, because old Stan and the company have been working on their world for more than half a century. A huge number of different characters and events taking place. However, cinema and the public demand epicness and grandiosity, and therefore trumps immediately come into play: the conversation about Celestials has been going on since the beginning of the second phase, but they really appeared to the world only now. A bid for success or another step into the abyss?"
602,10,"Syper! This year Marvel is delighting fans with films about new superheroes. Not so long ago, the spectacular film ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was released. And here is a new premiere, this time ""Eternal"".They have been living on Earth for millions of years, protecting the planet from deviant monsters. But as it turned out, their main mission is far from this and humanity is once again on the verge of death In general, a standard high-quality superhero movie. Marvel knows how to shoot such.One of the main advantages is the stellar cast. Now Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie (""Those Who Wish Me Dead""), Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and others have received registration in the Marvel Universe.The second plus is the scale, graphics, special effects... In general, the visual range is amazing.And of course the traditional Marvel humor, where without it))) But the disadvantages will be mostly subjective. Maybe I have watched similar films, but the new characters do not evoke emotions and are not remembered. Yes, Salma and Angelina are beauties, it's nice on them."
603,10,"F It's been a long time since a new Marvel movie caused such a resonance that the ""Eternals"" caused. Terrible ratings on tommats, low ratings from critics, cries that a complete failure were replaced by cries that this is the best Marvel movie with such constancy that I myself did not know what exactly to expect from the film. Chloe Zhao is undoubtedly an incredibly talented director, ""The Land of Nomads"" is a meditative masterpiece, but will the Oscar winner be able to shoot a major blockbuster for the main cinema franchise? He can! Yes, he can! As has been said several times - ""Eternal"" is not a Marvel movie, it's a Chloe Zhao movie, and this really makes it the best picture of the franchise in a very long time. Chloe Zhao, the director of independent films, was able to remove her author's statement skillfully hidden behind a bright, superhero costume. A meditative, infinitely sweet, meticulously introducing us to each character, the film puts at the forefront of a purely ""Snyder"" question - what kind of life is it for gods among people. A real drama about the gravity of the divine gift, an incredible epic, after watching which I would like to say - a MOVIE. ""Eternal"" has a lot in common with Zack Snyder's Justice League, not only by a long, thorough acquaintance with each character, not only the question raised for consideration, but also the feeling that the film leaves after its viewing. No Marvel movie has ever caused me such a strong sense of GREATNESS with its monumental approach to creating a picture. ""Eternal"" by Chloe Zhao is a brief excursion through all the mythology known to us (after all, it was the Eternal Ones who became the prototypes of all the mythical deities within the cinematic universe), it's an incredible cast, it's amazing characters (every single one!), it's a powerful drama that was not in the KVM before, and it's not a fact what will happen after. Despite the mixed reaction of the audience and critics, despite the not very good fees, I will firmly believe that Chloe Zhao will retain the director's chair in the sequel to ""Eternal"", because right now it seems that no one but her will be able to work with these characters as well. ""Eternal"", like ""Guardians"", feels like the brainchild of only one director, who left behind a gorgeous legacy within the framework of the KVM."
604,5,"Unfair Rating - Useless Review I feel that my rating may be unfair as I couldn't sit through this movie and turned off about 25 minutes in. And it probably isn't entirely the fault of this movie either.My case of MCU fatigue started kicking in by the time I watched 'Endgame' and to be honest I'm getting utterly bored of the whole super hero genre in general and specifically the MCU.Marvel have had better characters, better stories and they've done better movies than this in the past, so why do they think they can impress us with a trolley full of bargain basement, unimpressive superheroes and a snooze fest of a story line.As big as the universe is, it looks like there's a finite number of superheroes that you can fit into it."
605,2,"A waste of time It's hard to rate this movie highly. I remember the date of its appearance was equal to the date of positive reviews from friends who watched it. They praised it like they made the film themselves. What was my surprise when all these words uttered by my friends turned out to be just nonsense. I confess, the theme of superheroes, people who save the world just because they have super power, is not very close to me, because most of these films have an unfinished plot, very bad actors, who are not something that you don't believe, as Stanislavsky said, you are waiting so that they get out of this frame as soon as possible, and the film just continues, this film is no exception. When viewing it, the feeling of how stupid the acting heroes are does not leave. Didn't like it, overrated film, only action and special effects somehow pulled the film out of 1/10 to 2/10."
606,4,"Non-sensible movie I was unfortunately disappointed by this movie, despite anticipating it eagerly for years. The action sequences are underwhelming, the storyline doesn't make sense, on it's own, and relative to the other marvel movies. It's really annoying because it seems Disney is more interested in pumping out blockbusters with unfinished plots that don't tie into the corresponding universe. They make crap like the intermediary star wars movies that are not really part of the new trilogy.This new movie doesn't make sense because Eternals were supposedly always around, and wanted to protect humanity, but when Thanos wants to destroy half of humanity, they don't get involved. Apparently, because they're only allowed to fight deviants...which he is too actually. By the way, neither does Arishem. If the birth of the celestials in the universe was so important to him, wouldn't a madman going around the universe trying to destroy half of all life everywhere be a considered a threat and worthy of destroying? Apparently, no, because Thanos was an eternal-deviant, but worthy only of human defenders.Also, can we talk about the acting.... Seriously, no one on this planet asked for a Indian Eternal, and trying to pass off Kumail Nanjiani as hot or funny (he is supposed to be the comic relief after all) is ridiculous. Angelie Jolie's character Thena is silent but disturbed, fights well, but somehow forms a close bond, which an overweight asian eternal (Gilgamesh) who is supposed to be the ""strong"" one, because nothing says strong like a guy who's had one too many pizzas.Disney has also been pushing the gay agenda down everyone's throats lately. I have nothing against the LGBTQ community, but was it REALLY necessary to have that male-male kiss and convince the world that a child can be raised happily by two men? Like in Avengers Endgame in the support group, there was a gay guy describing his date.The whole movie felt more ""slow"", ""cerebral"" (which I appreciated because it kinda celebrates humanity, but ultimately, it's like ""ok, where's the real danger?""), and disconnected with the past franchizes."
607,4,"I'm a big fan and can excuse most Marvel mess ups but this one was hard to watch I'm a pretty big fan of the MCU and Marvel content. I'd heard this movie was pretty hard to watch but ignored all the negative hype and avoided reading reviews because some people just like to complain and I always like Marvel movies, unfortunately that's not the case this time. This doesn't feel like a Marvel film at all, maybe a B sci-fi movie.Don't expect the usual character depth, Easter eggs or interesting plot, this is more like a DC movie than a Marvel movie. They even reference Superman in this universe so that twists the cannon a little.It's got the Netlix problem where people are every race, gender and sexuality going which has no impact on the plot but disrupts the main movie flow for each person's gender/sexuality reveal.The special effects are sometimes amazing - but too often they look like Matrix (1999) and while that was great for its time - that's hard to excuse in 2022.The main plot is understandable, but the character development and constant flashbacks are really disruptive and more often than not, have no bearing on the story or character development. There's also no depth or weight to the story - it feels like the story of the Eternals and the effect on the rest of the world really didn't have any impact. I really didn't engage with the threat and wasn't at all worried about the effect on the world if the baddies win... I literally live on the world - but they made it feel more like a coin toss - everyone lives / everyone dies, but either outcome wouldn't make much difference to anyone.I'll not be watching it again - which I hardly ever say about a Marvel film...I doubt they will be making the Eternals 2, but we may see some characters in a cross-over of another film."
608,7,"Another good Marvel movie I want to say right away that I am a fan of Marvel. Marvel movies deserve attention. Despite the low rating, I really liked the film, more than two hours flew by unnoticed, and there was not a single minute of boredom. I didn't regret going. For fans of simple action movies, I think it will be boring, but for fans of heroism, comics, it should go with a bang!Pretty decent storyline, very unique. Of course, we are talking about saving the world. The story seemed intriguing. Pleasantly pleased with the cast. I won't tell you everything, otherwise you won't be interested. I recommend watching it on a wide screen. Excellent special effects, the film is large-scale, spectacular and dynamic."

610,6,"Marvel's first flop Ok, maybe it's not that real flop but personally I think this is a wrong way movie.Celestials could be ok but they seem to be showed as the biggest evil without consciousness that can change delicate credible balance between good Vs evil of MCU universe. Their act seem to be only dedicated to cosmic energy and creation without consideration to any life forms. This concept of supreme good already seen with Tanos, Ego etc... That could work one time but using it for every villain they think to propose in the future could be a bad idea.So who will fight vs these kind of powers? ""Little"" superheroes will fight versus their own creator to change fate of some life forms vs others? It feels like not real in my opinion.Then these eternals, maybe more powerful than standard superheroes on earth that we had seen and admire for now. We could call them legends cause they are oldest and famous: Spiderman, Thor, Hulk, Ironman, Cap etc... I think it's a big mistake trying to get back some sort of multigods vision getting from oldest mithology on earth. That kind of topic deserve better stories and more accurate plotline. In the end I don't like the mith of Athena, ""Gilgamesh"", olimpians in generals or other important historic religious or mith reference changed and manipulated like it was in the movie. These chars are.empty, without necessary characterization.Epic is not just a story of biggest, it has to build with details, climax etc... They seem to try with many ref during movie but they are chaotic and not enough minddeep considerations.I would prefer the much most realistic league of badass of DC universe with Lex Luthor, Joker etc.. chars Vs these kind of some sort of low profile tv series."
611,10,"Very nice I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don't know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute."
612,10,"review An excellent motion picture. A very long-awaited film from the Marvel superhero movie series. Motion picture quality in itself is a mass of pressing problems and solutions. There are feelings, emotions, good directing, excellent specials. Every moment of the film is breathtaking in its own way. Unexpected plot and twist. While watching, I could not predict the possible action and ending of the picture. Each of the heroes of the protest.I love all the films from Marvel, which have been reviewed a large number of times and several times. Another novelty is also impossible.Most of all I liked Angelina Jolie, my favorite actress, I was waiting for her appearance on the screen. She just played her part perfectly. As always on top. What do you want to say. The plot is felt somewhere in the middle, this is for me personally. The special effects are awesome. Inspection is just top notch. I personally liked the movie very much. No wonder I went to him and returned time. The finale was not unequivocal, I think we are waiting for the continuation. I give this film a good feedback at 9 departure! To view."

Just a bit!Overall it was uninteresting, boring, and just woke. I couldn't take any more and turned it off approx 40 minutes into it.

About the marvel superhero universe, and my universal vision is that there aint much twist in the goodybag, they tend to last too long and the plotspeed unbelievably slow, the scripted dialouges are itchingly irritatingly bad and expected and the grumpy old men like me strives to stay awake through 150 minutes...i'm not over excited by the choice of cast, and the casts delivery that seems like stumbling and commanded at moments, and that may also be due to bad ''taken water over thy head'' direction. I do also react that they do not use indeginous peoble like a samii or an aborigin actor in the superhero choir...an idea to follow up?But some things are good, vfx and cgi do make this a viewable encounter, the score is good, and the hindi-punjabi insertions of ''birdie num num'' comedy made me smile inbetween. So if you have a wooden club that you cut notches in for each superhero movie you have seen, then its a go for it.for us norwals ill recommend a try but not more than that..."
618,2,"Another marmite movie from Disney Some will love it some will hate it, whichever category you're in you're lying out your back teeth saying this is either the worst or best MCU movie, at best this movie is a 5, at its worst its a 2,I've opted for the latter simply because this movie fails at pretty much everything it attempts: story; lacklustre.Characters; dull.Action; mediocre.Had I not known I was watching a Disney /Marvel movie I would have believed this was another DC catastrophe, the characters looked more like DCs ""New Gods"" than Marvels ""Eternals"", perhaps the director got them mixed up as both properties were created, written & drawn by the late great Jack Kirby, a master storyteller, which Chloe Zhao definitely is not.Zhao was given full authority over the Eternals production & took it on herself to completely re-write the screenplay which is probably why the movie was as dull as it ended up being.Very little of the movie follows the original comic creation, from characters to storyline, Kirby created a complex story that would have probably been too much to adapt into a single movie & probably judged as too ""comic bookish"", Zhao has literally skimmed the surface of Kirbys work & chosen a more simplistic re-write of the Eternals, both story & characters.Boasting a budget of $200 million dollars, standard for today's so called ""blockbusters"", there is no reason for the movie to have anything but top notch cgi & effects, fantastic sets & breathtaking cinematography, which this movie has but the action scenes are dull, fantastically detailed but ultimately boring & that is also the case with all the characters, dull & dreary, Kirby wrote these characters as super human heroes with multiple fantastical abilitys & impossible to kill hence the name ""Eternals"", Zhao unpicks Kirbys creation in nonsensical fashion, stripping the characters abilities to a single defining one for each character.In Zhaos story the Eternals have been on earth for 7 thousand years, in this time, suffering barely a scratch then 2 die in the silliest most easy way possible,while then showing another being intensely & brutally beaten & battered but barely scratched or bruised, utter tripe.Zhao took Kirbys creation and used it for her own ends, diversity & inclusion, Eternals spends more time parading its diverse cast in their silly shiny costumes than telling an entertaining & imaginative story.If this is what's to come in future phases from Disney/Marvel then Marvels future is definitely on the downhill run."

621,4,"Wrong decision Set after the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Eternals tells the story of a group of interstellar beings tasked with protecting the planet Earth from ruthless entities known as the Deviants. They have been doing this for seven-thousand years and have followed every order from their leaders, the Celestials.Since the Avengers defeated Thanos and his army, a certain emergence has initiated, and the Deviants are returning to Earth. The change prompts the Eternals to saving the world again. However, their quest is not as easy as it appears. The Eternals' complicated pasts and love for humanity suggest conflicts that may tear the group apart and leave humanity's survival in doubt.Eternals is the latest film from Chinese-American filmmaker Chloe Zhao. She is best known for her acclaimed indie films The Rider (2017) and Nomadland (2020). Her works have been praised for their understated storytelling and verisimilitude and for portraying the beauty in empathy for her characters. Zhao directing Eternals shocked fans of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and independent filmmakersSeeing known indie filmmakers venturing into the MCU is common. The latest additions have been Aussie filmmaker Cate Shortland (best known for films like Somersault, Lore, and Berlin Syndrome) and Asian-American filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton (best known for films Short Term 12 and Just Mercy). However, there have been criticisms alleging the studio hires indie filmmakers and dilutes their talents for commercial gain and formula consistency.In an interview, Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel (best known for films like La Cienaga and Zama) said the studio told her to disregard directing action scenes while in contention to direct Black Widow (2021). This type of news will lead one to think hiring of indie/international directors are a way of placating to the masses through performative means. Will Eternals allay those doubts and transcend the MCU formula?From the first frame, Zhao and company have set the framework for Eternals to drastically differ from the other MCU films. The film features opening text crawls, a self-serious tone, an expansive storyline, reliance on real locations, long-term ramifications, conflicting ideologies, diverse casting, magic hour cinematography, and even a sex scene. The difference is refreshing in the first act. The sense of grandeur and scale lends weight to the story. However, as time goes on, the weight proves too heavy for Zhao and company to handle, and the film collapses like a house of cards.The techniques mentioned above suggest the MCU was aiming for prestige with Eternals (including using Zhao's award-winning credentials in the marketing). However, it feels performative and pandering more than anything else. The arthouse sensibilities, constant shifts in tone, and commercial framework mix as well as water and oil. It creates a distance between the audience and the film that makes it hard to emotionally grasp.Zhao's cinematic influences as a filmmaker (as claimed in interviews) range from Terrence Malick to Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu and they are clear as day in the film. An action sequence where Ikaris (played by Richard Madden) fights a Deviant is reminiscent of the bear attack sequence in The Revenant (2015). However, they do not work anywhere nearly as well as they should due to the hurried pacing/editing (possibly to appeal to mainstream audiences) and inferior lighting. For example, some of the set-pieces are too dark to be visually stimulating.The hurried editing also makes the drama surprisingly inert. The runtime of 157 minutes provides plenty of cinematic real estate in terms of establishing characterisations and the stakes in the story. The mammoth-sized dollops of exposition and non-chronological storytelling that cuts back and forth to the past and present leaves much to be desired. It homogenises the potential character worth to its bare essentials and leaves the film bloated yet undernourished.Many scenes lack enough breathing room for the audience to become intimate with the settings and characters. Consequently, they are left with character sketches rather than full-bodied people. Even when characters receive their chance to shine, the storytelling choices are distractingly bizarre, including a sequence implying one of the Eternals was inherently responsible for a real-life disaster.Worse, the dramatic arcs of the characters are rendered anti-climactic and unsatisfying due to Zhao (or Marvel's) insistence in levity over dramatic substance. An example of such fault involves Sprite (Lia McHugh) baring her soul about why she is distraught. Yet the dramatic potential is discarded for a joke.This is not to say Eternals is without merit. Despite the inconsistent lighting, the action scenes are better than usual due to the location work and reduced frenetic editing, which makes it more visually appealing. Zhao sticks to her guns as she portrays her characters as inherently flawed (as opposed to black-and-white ideals), leading them to make believable and surprising decisions.The actors make the most out of their characters and offer as much gravitas as possible. Barry Keoghan (appealingly roguish), Don Lee aka Ma Dong-seok (lending warmth and hulking presence), Lia McHugh (showing youthful exuberance and world-weary cynicism), and Angelina Jolie (bring moments of palpable rage and ferocity to both action and levity) are standouts.Even they are left short-handed, particularly in the case of the leads. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are remarkably talented, but together they offer no on-screen chemistry. For a romance meant to have spanned seven-thousand years, there are few sparks to be seen, which makes the climax's emotional element feel false and even laughable. Even the purported sex scene between the two feels shoved in and pulls out so swiftly. Pun intended.Overall, Eternals is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is too blatantly commercial to take advantage of the studio's new prestigious filmmaking talent and too outside the box to satisfy Marvel's audience. It is a heavily flawed attempt to bring the MCU to the next level."
622,1,"Eternally dull I really wish that some godlike humanoid characters, whether they have London or Mexican accent, or not, could come and not necessarily spend as much as 200 million USD, but still create something far more excititing than Eternals. That would be marvelous. However dull and stiff, predictable and pretentious this show is, it seems that many enough kids and addicted gamers get stuck on it, and contribute to double those figures at the box office. It is depressing, and probably even more so for all those who got much better ideas rejected."

It's hard to imagine the execs that approved this didn't walk out 20 minutes into the screening and say to start over. Misses on every cylinder. Total failure. Not something that I think I'll appreciate more later, that could do with a re-edit, etc. It's just bad.The most bloodless, emotionless story I can imagine. Absolutely flat and boring. I had no emotional attachment to anyone, or anything, and that's because they also all seemed to be walking through the scenes detached as well.All the monsters are so impossibly generic CGI monsters they left no impression at all. They aren't obviously dangerous, or anything. That's a problem.The villains monologue. All. The. Time. This is trite, boring, and contemptuous of the audience. We don't figure out anything, but are told. The movie could have been a pamphlet instead.There was no value in the constant flashbacks. They got in the way of the story. And no segues! It just jumps to thousands of years ago. Or Six Days Ago because why not tell the story out of order for no reason at all?Betrayal. Because of course there is. There's always someone betraying. But at least they give that away halfway through instead of it being a surprise."

Went to watch it in theatres and at one point my boyfriend and I actually started laughing at how strange everything was and debated on leaving halfway through the movie!!The introduction of so many characters was botched and even the acting felt very fake and not as natural as what we see in other Marvel movies...And can we just say it? I'm all for and I completely agree with including a wider variety of actors to the big screen but I mean it felt like they just wanted to put all of the visible minorities and LGBTQ+ into one same production and pretend like this was going to represent them adequately and ""voilà"" they're included we got it over with.... was almost insulting..Everything just felt rushed, they had big names that I felt didn't live up to their characters and it just felt like a bad ""trying too hard"" type of production... And don't get me started on the quality of their costumes... they didn't fit perfectly and actually looked cheap! They looked like costumes we could get for Halloween.. let's just say it wasn't IronMan or Captain America worthy.."
625,3,Superhero's have become sense magicians Seems like Marvel just has to keep the cash register running with cookie cutter movies. There seems to be no individual character or sense with any particular superhero. Just shake.your hands flashy lights and book magic. The entire cast to seems a misfit. Gemma chan seemed to be bored playing the part. I a big to cover all back stories the movie seems totally disconnected. Marvel please stop and let it end on a high.
626,9,"One of Marvel's Best I am reading other reviews and I wonder if we watched the same movie...? The movie was a great example of Marvel allowing different filmmakers the ability to create different superhero movies. Eternals was allowed to world build, character build, and begin to foreshadow of a greater enemy dynamic coming to the MCU. Agreed with some that the SFX needed some work but also I feel the art direction was on point.The only issue is how the ending dealt with one of the main characters of the film.Can't wait for a sequel and hope for more Marvel movies like this."
627,3,"An Eternal Bore The Good: If I have to give Eternals credit for any single thing, it's how distinct this movie is from the rest of the MCU. It's slower paced, more muted, more mature (in parts), and thankfully, lacking the ""comedy"" of the other Marvel movies. Zhao's cinematography is really nice too, even if the action scenes are lacking a punch. Action is clearly not her forte.I also really liked the historical scenes, maybe it's just me, but they were amongst the most colourful and interesting scenes in the movie.The Bad: But, this movie is overall quite bad. It's way too long and simultaneously, doesn't explain anything. It's stuffed with actors playing characters I didn't really understand or connect with all. There were just too many people and the movie ends up spending too much time juggling them, without creating a compelling narrative.These people never really feel like a ""family,"" despite the constant reminders that they're supposed to be. Despite this supposedly being a ""character driven"" movie, we never get a true sense of the group's dynamics or history. Which is ironic, given how much time we spend on introducing these lifeless characters.This movie also attempts to spice up the dull narrative about the world ending via giant aliens with philosophical musings about the Eternals' relationship with humanity. Unfortunately, it's not a particularly interesting discussion. OBVIOUSLY, the Eternals should (and would) side with humanity over their absenteee alien father who most of them have never spoken to, right?Worst of all, the characters don't seem to organically arrive at the ideological positions they end up taking. Nor is it ever explained why their powers are distinct...or why Arishem even cares if they intervene in support of humanity. Again, owing to an unbalanced, weird narrative that is constantly introducing characters, we never get answers to these questions. Not to mention an extremely undercooked villains and tired CG alien dogs as the main threat which seem...I don't know...creatures that could be handled by contemporary armies? They didn't really explain why these creatures MUST be destroyed by the Eternals.The Ugly: How is their a deaf Eternal? Seriously, why would Arishem do this? And how is speaking American Sign Language and pointing to her wrist - to indicate time - in 5th century Mesopotamia? How can a person - Sprite - who has lived for literally billions of years - speak Spanish so poorly? (I laughed so hard at this scene, I'm sorry). Why does Earth feel completely devoid of life? Why do the Eternals seem so disconnected from everything going on?It's one of those movies that Marvel wanted to be taken seriously...but it's far too stupid for that. Let's just forget this one ever happened, okay?"
628,3,"This film is 2 and a half hours long...and boy do you feel every second of it. This film suffered deeply from the one problem that should have been blindingly obvious from the moment they decided to make it...too many characters.10 superheros in one film, plus supporting characters, it was always a real worry that the characters would lack development, and you wouldn't get to know anyone enough to actually care about them. And that's exactly what happened.GOTG just about pulled it off with 5 heros, and even that only worked because one of the characters was a tree with one line and came at the expense of a one dimensional villain.Eternals doesn't mange to give you characters which you care about or empathise with. Honestly, you struggle to remember most of their names half the time.Rob Stark appears to be as thrilled to be in this film as he was at the end of his last wedding. Angelina Jolie is basically just there. Salma Hayek does what she can, especially with a character that the script doesn't seem to realise is actually a terrible leader; but thats not enough to save the film. Gemma Chan hasn't really got the personality to carry the film and her character isn't written in any way that you'd really care about her either.Sprite and Druig are actually really annoying characters, Makkari is just there for most of the film and Phastos isn't given much to do beyond talking about his family.The only characters/actors with any personality and charisma are Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo and Ma Dong-seok as Gilgamesh. While they manage to steal the scenes they are in, for some reason the film decides they need less screen time...perhaps the actors needed surgery after carrying the fist half of the film on their backs.Despite this bloated cast, the 2 and a half hour run time still feels like an eternity, because pacing is a huge problem with this film.A huge portion of the film is dedicated to 'getting the band back together' and honestly, with the exception of the 2 scene stealing stars doing their best, the entire second act moves with all the pace of your average glacier.The film lacks any real villain, so you're not even invested in the struggle. Anyone sold as a villain is eventually just 'misunderstood' or doing what they have to...which makes the third act even more dissapointing.If I can say anything good about the film, I can say that it's visually impressive, but thats about it. Beyond that it was a chore to get through."
629,8,"Worth a watch On the whole I did enjoy this film , although some of the casting was unusual . A couple of the characters are played by such well known actors that I couldn't buy into the fact there were in fact eternals. There was a twist at the end which looks as though will be interesting to explore. Could have done with being a bit shorter . Was incredibly long , and some parts drawn out . Effects were spectacular as we come to expect these days . There is a smattering of comedy thrown in which lightens the general sombre feel .Worth a watch."
630,10,"Probably the most different... It has to be the most unique Marvel movie I've seen and quite honestly I'm glad it strayed from the formulaic typical Marvel movie... it was a bit long, and could have very well been made in to a 10 part series if they wanted to dive deeper into all the characters, but they didn't really need to once you find out they're origin. The only thing that truly bothered me about the characters was the young one who even though has 7000 years of memories still acts like a kid, but that could also have to do with her origin. The movie was good, it had many different personalities throughout the cast. Aside from scientific technicalities it played well and I hope they make a sequel... it's a touch darker than your typical Marvel go, so that's something to be aware of."
631,1,"What Did I Just Watch Marvel. You have outdone yourself. You have created a truly magnificent franchise and completely and utterly spat on any and all talent to make this nightmare of a movie.I had zero emotional connection to the characters. I didn't care if all of them died at any given moment.The CGI should be deemed illegal.Still trying to figure out the story, and if it's good enough for me to care.Take a poorly executed plot, character development and cgi, and throw in HARRY STYLES of all people at the end, and you have created the perfect concoction of the worse marvel movie made to date."
632,3,"Why, oh, why does this happen? I feel bad writing a negative review because, obviously, as in most films, a lot of effort went into making it. A lot of talented creatives worked on it and hopefully gave it their best shot. So why, oh, why, does this happen?I'll tell you why, and as I'm writing this, I'm getting mad. Like, I'm actually getting angry.Please stop. Stop, please. Already.How. Many. Times. Can. Superheroes. Save. The. Earth. This is ridiculous. But it is not even about that. Fine, you want to save Earth, you want to have superheroes. But how about put a little thought into it? I'm sorry. But...this script. Attempted jokes falling flat, cliché dialogue every minute, seemingly complicated plot which is at the same time predictable and I don't even know what to write about it, at times it makes no sense. And I cannot believe how many scenes could be cut out...so many pointless moments, time wasted.And oh my God. Thena? Thena?? ""Thena, no A-"" Another ""great"" idea which would have been original if it wasn't absolutely ridiculous. When will these Hollywood writers stop stealing names and concepts from mythology from each corner of the world, only to turn them into a joke? It's mythology, alright, of course, it's there for everyone. It's free. It is the cultural heritage of our human species. Yes, we've read ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"". But how about little common sense ? When getting ""inspired"", how about a little respect, how about a little levelling up? How about a little thoughtful originality in interpretation ?How about I stop being so naïve...there I go wanting story, there I go wanting a little depth. And there go $200 million...MARVELous."
633,5,"Do we really have to bring back the ancients Do we really have to bring back the ancients as a premise to explain the F'd times we are in now? And no it isnt racial division or climate change that is gearing us up for the end times. Thena, Makkari and Druig decide they're going to track down Eternals on other planets, to reveal their origins and the fact their mission will doom their host world's inhabitants.""The truth will set them free,"" Makkari says before they take the team's ship out into the galaxy."
634,5,"Boooooring!!! The first Marvel movie to be actually boring. As great as Marvel succeeded with ensemble movies such as Avengers or Guardians ot Galaxy, as bad did they fail here.Strangely enough the CGI effects were unimpressive, but the biggest flaw is the complete lack of interesting character, the lack of a compelling villain and thus the lack of tension or climatic battle. Even the Celestial was underwhelming.The best they can do is no more sequel, and just integrate the characters in future ensemble movies, because with the current direction, they don't deserve their own."
635,6,"Good from the Start but Bad at the end I'm going to be honest here. The final fight sucks and here's my reason why. Ikaris got the guts to kill Ajak but can't kill Sersi. I know they are lovers but why suddenly stop there? They just look at each other no talking just random flashbacks and then ikaris suddenly joined the Uni-Mind. Sersi could have atleast talked it out with ikaris instead of making them stare at each other. Also Druig bonk Sprite and suddenly joined the Sprite. Anyway The point is, the final fight feels rushed and lacks explaination. Like why Tiamut joined the Uni-Mind? What was the bracelet for? Why didn't Thena help during Gilgamesh vs Kro?I'm not gonna lie the final fight between Thena and Kro was boring. I can imagine a better fight for thena vs kro and a better way to kill kro. So yea the fight fight sucks because it feels rushed that's all."
636,4,"Should have been a Disney+ series... Introducing one new, unheard of character can be a challenge. Guardians took a risk introducing 5 somewhat obscure characters (and it worked).But introducing 10 main characters plus another major side character (Black Knight) and packing backstories and conflict and love interests and villains and heroes and betrayal and customary three major action sequences and good dialogue... this film lacks all of that. I mean technically it's there, but not in enough quality to really make me care about the characters or the story.Eight episodes at 45-50 minutes each could have told this story with plenty of drama, action, and build-up that it really would have worked. But 2.5 hours of tell-don't-show just really didn't do it. If anything it wasted excellent acting talent on a sub-par story.I wanted to like this, and I avoided a lot of other reviews, even though the box office numbers were really hard to not see. But this was just disappointing."
637,4,"This movie has no reason to suck this much. If you've seen Aquaman, then you know how beautiful a bad movie can be. Eternals is much like that. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and that's all. The plot is overly convoluted and poorly written. There are lot of unnecessary and badly delineated time-jumps. Absolutely no character development or arcs. Something important is happening to Thena, but since we don't now a single thing about her, it's hard to determine if she's just Like That or if it's a plot point. And guess what? It's neither! There's too much exposition about the wrong things, no exposition about wtf is actually going on. The characters are nothing more than avatars- the only personality trait available leans a little too far on the Sassy Sidekick trope to really count.I cannot comprehend how so many talented actors turned out performances that were wooden, stilted, and dull. I don't know why Chloe Xhou chose this iteration rather than using Gaiman and Romita Jr's much more exciting (and narratively sound) updated version. It makes no sense to hire the amazing Ramin Djawadi to score the film and then mix the music down so low that you can't hear it. Dane needed more scenes to establish any kind of connection with the audience so we give a crap about what he's doing at the end of the film. Actually, that's true for almost everyone in this flick. The more I think about it, the more stuff I find to dislike. This movie has no reason to suck this much."
638,5,"Missing the Marvel Charm Not all of the MCU movies are necessarily good movies, but they all at least had something I liked about them. Eternals feels like it came from a whole different creative place. It was long, boring, and I couldn't find a reason to care about the protagonists. There was something alien about the look and feel of this movie thatvleft me cold (no pun intended. It alsonlacked the fun and wit that other MCU movies have. Jolie and Hayek were miscast. Their performaces were stiff and half-hearted. Also, when you have a main character named Sersi, who happens to share a name with a main character from a blockbuster like Game of Thrones, don't cast two other guys from GoT as leads. It was very difficult to to get into the film when the characters keep taking you back to another program. Honestly, I don't have any affinity for this film and I wouldn't care if I never saw these characters again in another MCU property."
639,2,"Devoid of any charima & character development Maybe the reason Marvel movies, inspite of having so many characters, have managed to keep us entertained is because we grew up reading & watching these characters. We all knew the story of Spiderman, Captain America & all. However, with Eternal, Marvel failed to realise that for most of us, we dont know about the eternals. I couldnt emphatise with a single character during the almost 2.5 hour long movie. Salma Hayek & Angelina Jolie delivered a disappointing performance, maybe because of the terrible script. A very disappointing show for me."
640,7,"Not a bad movie This is not a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. It just falls into the trap of trying something new and forgetting some essentials elements. I actually enjoyed watching this, there are some of the most beautiful landscapes in the whole MCU here and one or two decent action scenes. I do regret that the characters and their relationships were not explored more in depth, I think it could easily have been an incredible 4-hour long movie. With a lot of character development, trying to merge mythology with their story... etc. All in all, I don't understand all the hate for this movie, it does honor its promise to offer us something new in the MCU and I'm glad for it."
641,7,"(Quite) Entertaining I've seen plenty of negative reviews saying how bad this film was and I simply disagree. The film delivered on every aspect it attempted: be it visual effects, strong cast or a followable storyline. In this sense it was an enjoyable piece of entertainment which I do not regret watching.The true shortcoming of this film is not that it spectacularly flopped but simply that it succeeded on delivering a disappointingly unambitious piece of cinema. The characters were largely two-dimensional and the story was fairly clear from the getgo. The midway twist was not shocking because we did not yet know enough for it to surprise us and the conclusion was predictable at best, cliché at worst.Overall a waste of a good cast and a budget, but not a waste of a couple of hours to watch it."
642,7,"They live among us Marvel is unable to top ""Endgame"" and clearly needs new direction. So they created another superhero group that lives at the same time of the Marvel characters but don't associate with them. The Eternals were created to protect mankind from the Deviants and in the end (plot spoiler) must allow the Celestial Tiamut destroy the Earth so he can create other worlds and people.The film provides us with a corundum. Save the earth and prevent new lives from happening or let the Earth. The film hints that you can gut the sound an listen to it while playing 'Dark Side of the Moon"" on loop. And 2001 called. They want their monolith back. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is poorly done. Gilgamesh represented a solar deity. He had long hair.Guide: No swearing or nudity. Brief sex scene."
643,5,"Marvel's first major mistake I really wanted to enjoy this movie, the acting was very good as were the special effects, but the movie felt over long and deliberately stretched. Out of all the possible comics in the MCU, I think this was a mistake, it's the same thing I feel about Captain Marvel, they are too powerful, godlike, they don't have enough flaws. I think this would have been better as a stand-alone."
644,3,"Not the best next installment to the Marvel franchise... I am a semi-""die hard"" fan of Marvel films as well as the new limited series (Loki, WandaVision, etc.). This latest installment, The Eternals, was highly anticipated. I have to admit that I watched it on Disney+, whatever difference that made. I found the story slow, disjointed and disappointing. I felt something was missing. Angelina Jolie was definitely casted wrong and not used at all to the level of her talent. The characters ""abilities"" were silly; the monsters were annoying. The lead Deviant was a missed opportunity and underdeveloped. Other underused characters or missed opportunities? Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, the mute Eternal. There is so much more that could have been done with this character other than putting her in a ship for thousands of years with a bunch of books. What??? The real ""villian"" of the movie was Ikaris, but that was transparently apparent early on. To cap off a ""meh"" movie, the end credits was not intriguing at all. To see Harry Styles - I won't be watching the next film in the series is my prediction. Overall: Disappointing, disjointed, dismissed."
645,6,"Flat I watched this at the cinema, and now watched it again on Disney plus.This movie is quite beautiful to look at but it's very flat. There was more thought put into the inclusion of diversity instead of fleshing out the characters, and it's hard to connect to them. The story is flat and pretty unemotional.The movie feels more like they were trying to copy Justice League.The best part of the movie is the first post credit scene (not sure about the casting though)."
646,2,"Waste of time It's okay if you don't feel any connection to the characters in the first few minutes. Even after half an hour it might be forgivable. But in this movie, after 140 minutes, when the film is finally reaching its climax, you still don't give a damn about any of them because the character development is either non-existent or hackneyed. No effort is made to make the world feel real so that it's worth saving, either.Don't waste your time or money."
647,4,"Slow going, could have been much better. Sitting through 'The Eternals' is a pretty dull affair, nothing really happens for most of the movie apart from a few fights with some CGI monsters 'Deviants' we are meant to believe, throw in a few jumps through history and the 7,000 years this group have meant to be around on our Earth without interfering in our evolution? I find that hard to believe!The plot is kind of ok but plods along at such a slow pace it's hard to keep your attention span for too long, add in a few corny accents and acters who you can't quite connect with and you end up with a pretty average Marvel film.I read a few reviews that gave it such high scores, and a few Marvel fans were putting this in their top 10 from the franchise. It's one to watch if you're a Marvel fan and want to stay in the loop, but be prepared for the bad jokes and a long drawn out movie that has little to offer."
648,1,Flat movie with flat characters Just boring movie with no character build.Just flat movie with flat characters. Director is totally at fault here with no good direction skills.Cast is long time died load of 50+ actors.I ask my god why I've seen this movie......................................Not a marvel movie by any standardsBoring boring.
649,7,Twice is Nice!! I recommend watching this a second time to gain more appreciation for this movie. Is it the best? Of course not. But it is definitely not the worse. The IMAX Enhanced on an OLED is where it's at!!
650,5,"Ho-hum Pretty boring movie and disappointing given the pedigree. Didn't really care too much about the characters; poor casting; the jokey India character was poorly written; the pace was too slow ... What more can I say?! Watch if you're really bored, but don't expect too much."
651,5,"Bags of potential that fell flat This film should have been great, like really great.They had all the ingredients to make something epic, but sadly the final product was middle of the road blandness that was fairly boring.What's more confusing is that on paper, just the cast alone should have at least given us great performances.What we actually got were actors that seemed they couldn't be bothered. So many lack luster performances and sometimes painfully cheesy.On the plus side, the special effects were pretty good and there was some half way decent action set pieces and enjoyable comic relief at times.Overall, a boring badly acted bland by the numbers film."
652,1,"Slow and uninteresting Well this is the first Marvel film where I have fallen asleep half way through. It was so boring! Did not catch your interest in anyway. Was a long, boring and wasted few hours. I can't believe so many famous actors and such a disappointment. Really poor film for the MCU."
653,9,"Underrated by far. This movie is great. It is well acted, visually stunning, and deals with important ethical issues and big questions that confront existence, agency, and humanity.It is occasionally heavy handed on social issues and it allows passionate pithy quotes that were unearned in the overall tone and action of the film. Still, it confronts and asks questions which is important.I hope the powers that be at Marvel recognize COVID tentativeness, troll down voting, both effected the box office, and keep these characters as prominent in the next phases of the MCU."
654,2,"I can't get to the end of film First Marvel film which is not watchable. Not interesting, not good plot (very similar to first boring Marvel's film before Hulk), not suitable actors to their roles. I have never supposed to direct some kind of not watchable film with not limited budget."
655,4,"Its an Ok for ""a movie"", but not for marvel franchise The writing and directing is BAD.They have the chance to be big. Clearly, they didnt take that chance.The dialog is bland. The timing is off. The execution is terrible .There are scenes that supposed to be touching but it didnt.For god sake, they are able to make Angelina Jolie acting so lifeless with those script.Most of the jokes missed. I didnt even realized those are jokes.Apparently the good scenes were the one where there are no dialogs. Like between druig and ikaris or druig and makkari or ikaris and sersi... once they talk, it became weird.Because most of the conversation in the movie didnt even have depth. Supposed catchphrase wasnt even worth to be remembered.Its okay for just ""a movie"". But its bad if you realise it is a Marvel movie with bunch of great actors. With those kind of script and execution, they could just hire third rate actors and we cant tell the difference between supposed to be a box office and a low budget movies."
656,10,"Eternals I literally liked this. Mainly this movie contains many plot twists such as Thanos being a good guy, Eternals are robots crested by Arishem and many more. Even the plot is amazing and a new concept with new superheroes with new superpowers.There were even new concepts such as celestials. It was more of like watching marvel and DC superheroes combined in a movie. The last fight between thena and the deviant was mindblowing and gave me goosebumps. The fight in the amazon was also breathtaking and to say there were also some sad moments like Ajak's death.I don't know why many hate this movie like this was like another Avengers movie after avengers: endgame. Many stories were linked together and there were some parts of the movie which change the whole movie. One such part was Ikaris actually being a kind of bad guy and he himself killing Ajak.Even though movie had some of these things it was really good."
657,6,It was slow and not entertaining So I'm a big marvel fan so when I found out a movie about a group of people fighting aliens while they are also aliens I thought hell yer. Throughout the movie. I just seemed to go on my phone out of boredom because it was just slow. I would've given the movie a 5 but I couldn't help give it a 6 because of the amazing ending. The characters weren't to bad I would've loved to see more of Ajak and Sprite was a little annoying at times but the romance and bromance between the characters are rlly cute like Sersi and Ikaris seeing them throughout the ages. It was funny at times like the IKEA scene and Kingos scene. For a two hour and I think 30 minute movie I would say not worth its run time and they probably could've rammed it down to 2:10. Not the best marvel movie but it's worth a binge watch until the end.
658,2,This movie was terrible! I really wanted to like this movie but it fell short. The plot was confusing as well as the characters. Not a fan of Jolie but this movie was beneath her talents.
659,6,"So much potential not realized The beginning was very poorly done.. so much so it set the entire story off even to the finish.Sometimes it felt like actors were just reading lines.Sometimes it felt like a TV movieI have to wonder if the director watched their own film before presenting it to the world? Because why would they have given us this when there was the potential for so much more... and yes our expectations are high.Marvel has been able to deliver many wonderful films that were written and produced in such a way that we suspend disbelief or don't even have time to think about it because we have bought into the story.This movie gave far too many opportunities to feel disconnected and uncomfortable with the story.In the end when I saw the story and what it was trying to do, I really felt disappointed that the writers, directors, producers etc had not done a better job with this. It could have felt like another added piece to the story line instead of feeling like this goulash mess.I wanted to like it... and I gave it a better rating than it probably deserves."
660,2,"So glad I didn't pay to see this. (My family watched this in theatre, I watched it at home.) One of my biggest complaint was how hyped these visuals were, yet the film is totally washed out and dark, as if under a bad filter. I did ask my family if this movie looked right on our new TV, but they confirmed it was this dark in tones in theatre as well. Weird. It only became bright in the very few fight scenes or power activation scenes to highlight the gold. The Deviant designs looked out of place for the settings as well.This film is entirely hard to watch. It's incredibly slow paced for a little over 2hrs and I often found myself checking the run time ever 20 minutes wondering, ""Is it over yet? When will it get good?"". The plot drags and unfortunately the talent of the actors does get to shine here.The Eternals are essentially an outdated group of super-robots who has to rediscover their purpose and choose their own paths for life after learning the truth of their creation. Eternals checks the block of diversity; although some character choices seemed a bit forced. (How is a god-robot deaf? The sign language is a nice touch, but seemed inappropriate after the ""big reveal"" and made the dialog in the movie feel one-sided many times. Also, why doesn't Brian Henry have more chemistry with his character's literal husband? He plays the father role well, but the gay romance did not shine through as convincing.) When the characters most memorable qualities are about their present life and are watered down with failed humor interjection, it is hard to remember what their actual powers or relevancy was. (For example, I literally could not remember Sersi fighting until the very last few fight scenes when all characters are suddenly more interested in her inherited ability.) With as much indivual screen time they gave each character, I actually wonder if this would turned into a better limited TV series.Overall, I'm not sure where this film was going. Hands down the worst Marvel film out there. It did a lot of world building, only to further prove that the Eternals are irrelevant as some sort of guardians of earth. Not excited to see them featured in the teased Guardians of the Galaxy. A real shame too, considering the actors in this film are otherwise really talented. (They really did Gemma Chan wrong by giving her such a stale character... and I do hope Ma Dong-seok gets better recognition for western films, he is AMAZING in action films.)"
661,10,"Nice movie. I've waited a long time, now the time has finally come. The trailer showed good things and otherwise you also noticed a lot of advertising. Disney+ now has it in its collection too.The Eternals are immortal extraterrestrials linked with various abilities intended to eliminate the evil Deviants on earth. Good story that captivates you combined with good action. At first you think there are too many superheroes at once, but then you get used to it. Many familiar faces appear in the movie, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. The movie is about saving the earth, I can say without really spoiling it.Coming to the conclusion I would like to say that I really enjoyed the movie and it is fun like several other Marvel movies. From me the highest number of stars for a very good entertainment."
662,10,"loved every second of it Movie was pretty great. What do you expect from Disney/Marvel. I can see this movie getting hate from the straight marvel guys lol women director, gay love, romance. You know everything they will hate on lol."
663,6,"Great premise, juvenile execution, shoulda been a series vs film We've waited a looooong time for ""Eternals"" to hit Dis+ thanks to Covid. The story/plot is great, it's epic, and the production values are Tier 1. However, and this is why people are complaining so much, directory Chloe Zhao just isn't that experienced. This is her second feature-length film besides the tepid ""Nomadland"" and frankly it was just too ambitious to think she could swing it. Her interpretation is that ""Eternals"" are basically super-humans - with all the frailties and faults of humans, instead of a separate race of beings that you'd imagine would hopefully be more cosmically focused than so earth focused and a lot more mature/evolved. It just trivializes the epic nature of the story to have such powerful beings vulnerable to love, hate, anger, bias, and betrayal. And a short note about the climax, ugh, basically an unrealistic deus ex, a real disappointment. Finally, major Marvel content of this nature should be a streaming series, not shoehorned into the compriomising 2+ hr format of a film, it cheats everyone of its real value. This could've/should've been a 9 or 10 level Marvel actioner but it's in the 6 to 7 range due to all these problems/issus."
664,2,2.5 hours of pointlessness Beautiful photography Beautiful special effects Reasonable acting Absolutely pointless storyline producing 2.5 hours of pointless dialogue arguing the worth of humans. So over supers for supers. Can't stress enough the pointlessness of sitting through this movie.
665,7,"Ambitious, but doesn't quite hit Interesting story and great visuals. Unfortunately, the characters are very flat and the dialog somewhat lazy. I admire the scope of the movie, but found it very hard to care about any of the Eternals. At least it tried - unlike Black Widow, which was just formulaic and dull."
666,6,"What in the DC is this? Seriously, if I didn't know any better I would assume I just spent the last almost 3 hours watching a DC movie. That's not a compliment. It went on for SO much longer than it needed to to tell the story it told. Also, was someone in a hurry to get through the CGI on this film? I am a huge Marvel fan (comics and MCU) and it pains me to leave anything short of a raving review, but this one was not my favorite. I guess I've just come to expect more from the MCU and this just wasn't it. I mean it wasn't terrible, but it definitely could've been better."
667,6,Wasn't terrible It really wasn't terrible. The acting was ok. Another comment said it would work as a series and I totally agree with that. It was very very very very very too long.
668,10,"The best way to usher in Stage 4 of the MCU. One of my all time favorite Marvel Movies Fenomenal movie, don't understand the negative reviews at all. One of, if not the best Marvel Movies. Epic story line, very, very good writing, good character development, good motives, fantastic locations, humor, dialogue, CGI, the list goes on and on. I love how they incorporated big historic moments in the movie, and that it's being told in a non-chronological order really drives the movie home. I don't know what they could've done better to usher in Stage 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 10/10 for me."
669,1,"A TERRIBLE SECOND VIEW EXPERIENCE Was absolutely painful to watch it second time. Where to start from... Every single character's move, line and story twist-n-turn was annoyingly predictable than ever. So unpleasantly unsurprising. Acting was tagged, a total cliché. Not a single try or aiming to be more original than the first viewing, means no creativity. The humor was irritating. The action scenes were less exciting than watching a parody of Swan Lake at the local school. Camera work, if there was anything like ""work"", felt like they have tied up a half broken camera on a limping mule's back, and have left. Editing is most atrocious: shot transitions felt long, even and boring, seems they've forgot to buy themselves a watch. Sequences have lost every meaning in the world they might have had in the first place. The soundtrack couldn't have been more inappropriate and insipid. ..... Expecting to like it? Don't watch it twice. Not even once."
670,4,Not new concept Movie Starts And it looks amazing at the first sight but Slowly slowly its getting boring But with Good Vfx And special effects .Story is not new old Cocept can be seen in the movie .For special effect 💯 For story 20 Ending 10 Not that empressed .😠😠
671,6,"Yo!!!! Hear me out...what if (remember you heard it here first lol) Thanos is an Eternal from Titan. Right?! His brother is Prince Star Fox/Fire or whatever his name is. Also an Eternal. Thanos' main objective was to reduce the population of the universe. He kept saying it was about food and resources when he spoke to others but WHAT IF he knew of Arishem's plans, just like Ajak, and decided he would end the Celestials for some reason? Or control them? Or change their impact on the universe or whatever?Don't get me wrong, I feel like the screenplay was really lacking unfortunately. But if we know Marvel we know this movie was made for a reason. I think that was the reason. That and Phastos made Shang Chi's 10 rings lol. How his dad got them idk."
672,5,"Meh, overblown. All the involved, writers, producers, directors, etc., really wanted an all-out spectacle of CGI and special effects, and that's what they delivered. Unfortunately, it's a bit too much in those respects."
673,9,"Love it!!! I was initially skeptical. It's really pretty long, around 2 and a half hours plus, but I really enjoyed it, no boring dull parts, it kept you interested throughout. Different type of super adventure movie to enjoy unless you sitting around looking for flaws and being a nerd, it's different. Special effects were great as far as I'm concerned, it's entertainment and that is why we watch in the first place. Do not let ANYONE tell you not to watch this movie. See for yourself, it's new characters, not your run of the mill superhero movie. To get my wife to watch it and enjoy it was major. I highly recommend and I hope the have a sequel and close it out with no cliffhanger. I gave it a 9 because nothing is perfect, but I wanted to."
674,1,Disgusting movie from Marvel I was never a big fan of Marvel but I enjoyed Shanh Chi and the latest Spider Man so I decided to watch this with my family and... I remembered how bad Marvel really is... It's like if this plot was written by a teenager. Oh and takes an eternity to end as well and is so bad that I felt like just walking out.
675,1,"Horrible This was a horrible movie. I don't know any of the characters and I've never heard of them so I couldn't care less about the characters.I never heard of or read about the guardians of the Galaxy before, but those movie characters were much better. You enjoyed watching them and you like them right away.This movie does nothing to make you like or care about what's going on. It's all a bunch of senseless nonsense."
676,4,"Could Zack Snyder fix this, too? Wrong universe, I know, but perhaps as long as it is, there story filmed was much longer and got butchered in editing like Justice a league did? Otherwise, it's a wasteland of those who were in Hollywood, to those who want to be, to those who never will. Sad to say, but it seems like Kit Harrington was cursed by the end of GoT. Also, since I'm not a Marvel or DC comic reader. Are the Eternals supposed to be the forerunners of all the Marvel superheroes? From Prof. X to Quicksilver to Dr. Strange and on and on. It was nice to see Salma Hayek again in a big budget film even if it is not well done. Angelina Jolie as corrupted is a bit of type casting isn't it? She was much better in Wanted and many other action films. And why Greek Mythology of ALL the Mythos in the world? If from the comics, that was still pretty short-sighted and very limited. And how about all that Bollywood in this movie? How pathetic."
677,6,"Nice idea but third act lets the film down The film looks stunning and i actually think most of the cast does a good job. The third act seems rushed considering the slow pacing of the film up to that point. The characters also are forgettable, I'm not sure i actually like any of them. Maybe they should not have introduced so many in the same film and instead concentrated on less characters that are more fleshed out.The concept of saving a population but knowing you are preventing many other generations from being formed is an interesting dilemma and is unique so i commend that concept. Not a horrible film, but certainly watchable..."
678,5,"It might as well have been a DC movie Moody, plodding, soulless & CGI laden its as if Marvel looked at the last couple of terrible DC movies and thought ""forget our winning formula, theirs is the way backward"".Just view it as a standalone comic adaptation/disaster movie, waste 3h of your life and move on."
679,8,"One of the best in the Marvel universe Most Marvel movies are juvenile cinematic comic books. Eternals is more a graphic novel, with a complex tale to tell. There is more character development, and meaningful interplay between characters, in Eternals than in most Marvel movies. The direction by Chloé Zhao was apt. Recommended. Among my other marvel favorites is Doctor Strange (2016), for the mystical bit, and Guardians of the Galaxy 1, for being a rollicking adventure."
680,3,"too complicated The movie is too long and complicated. Lost interest in it very soon.Bad acting and I was happy for the fast forward button on the remote control.Skip this one,terrible movie."
681,10,"Eternal is one of the better MCU movies The fact that Venom 2; which was just plain garbage has a higher critic score than The Eternals is just mind blowing! Venom was a movie which felt like it was made in the 90s when many comic book movies weren't good. The Eternals had great visuals, epic and catchy music by GAME OF THRONES composer Ramin Djawadi, fun and new characters; Ringo and his assistant were fun. I don't know wtf these critics and some audiences want! If a movie has too much action then they want some characters development. When they try to develop characters, then the movie is boring and want more action; Eternals had both! The movie tried to tell a new, different story, with different characters while world building and world building takes time and exposition! I can't believe these critics liked Black Widow, Hulk, Iron Man 2 and 3, Captain Marvel over The Eternals. Maybe it's slow at some parts, but that's where you develop characters! You cannot have action 24/7. Anyways, I cannot wait to see more of the Eternals in future MCU movies and shows since this movie literally changes the MCU from the formulaic films they've been so far. Which people have been complaining about as well."
682,9,This was pretty pretty good I was pleasantly surprised.Went in with no expectations due to the reviews but boy did I enjoy it.Give it a chance its a great movie to spend a night with.
683,7,"Pleasantly surprised I put off watching ""Eternals"" after hearing and seeing some mixed reactions about it. But after finally giving it a go myself, I was actually quite pleasantly surprised. Is it the best movie ever? - No. It's not perfect but for the amount of new characters and storyline they introduced in the 2.5 hours it kept me interested and I never felt bored.The visuals were great and so was the music, which comes to no surprise when it is scored by Ramin Djawadi.I give this a 7/10, not the best but certainly not as bad as many other reviewers and critics claim it to be. Give it a chance."
684,9,"Surprising Flawed, but one of the best MCU movies out there. One of the very few still able to surprise me and keep my interest throughout its running time. Kudos to the team for having crafted such a beautiful and different movie."
685,1,"Tough to watch Poor acting, plot, story, graphics . This film was hard to watch, I'm reminded of Disney's ""Black Hole"" bomb at the box office back in the 80s. I should've be refunded my Disney plus subscription for being tortured."
686,2,"What a freaking mess! The story is comic book as I childish and unbelievable at ANY level. You don't have any reason to connect with the characters and they all feel incredibly wooden. The pase is very slow with many plots which in no way help the story along, and the world it tries to create is so dumb I still can't believe they tried. Jeez! The glory days of MARVEL have truly come to an end."
687,10,"One Of The BEST MCU FILMS of all time! I am flabbergasted as to where all these negative reviews are coming from.I swear I was so influenced upon reading them, that that it what I was expecting when I started watching it - and to my pleasant surprise, the film turned out to be just the opposite.The film has the best visual representation of outer world giant super-beings (Celestials), even better than the scenes of Dormammu in Doctor Strange.The funny punches do kick-in. The emotions are right in place. And the visuals and the action is just mind-boggling.This is what Marvel is about and this is what we want to see on the big screen. I fail to understand how this did not gross more at the box office.Did total justice to so many MCU concepts and comic-figures. One of the best MCU films of all time, no doubt."
688,10,"ONE OF THE FINEST WORKS OF MCU The movie had everything one could ask for, we fantasized about celestials in MCU and This movie actually showed then in full, from the cast to mindboggling special effect scenes, this is one epic movie we MCU fans got after Infinity war.Eternals actually lived up to all the hype it received, I have no idea why this masterpiece is getting so much of hatred in the so called 'reviews'Waiting for the second part eagerly."
689,2,"Insert pun about eternal run time here... I started passing out not even half way through. Finally at about the two hour mark I checked out and left to do something else while my wife steadfastly attempted to finish this awful wooden mess. As usual I blame the writers and directors here, not the actors. They did what they could with what they were handed. Sadly they were asked to sculpt a wet fart into a masterpiece but even Michelangelo can't work in a medium consisting of sewage and hot air.This isn't cannon, it never happened, and it's not part of the MCU. Even Howard The Duck is cannon in my head, but not this."
690,3,"Underwhelming Personally I wanted to like it but I just didn't. There were too many characters with little to no development. They grossly underutilized Thena by crippling one of there best characters and then killing off the other best character (Gilgamesh) while she's having an episode behind a tree. I don't get it she gets violent and fights her team mates but when she goes through an episode when a bad guys around she's basically docile doesn't fight then.Then there's Sersi, ok I like Gemma Chan I think she's a good actress but what she was given to work with was pathetic. Sersi is a wooden character who doesn't command attention or the rest of the group. So much so it's a struggle to remember why she's even there in the first place. She didn't propel much of the story. I get it she loves humanity so much she was the natural choice to save them but she was still very hard to follow. Your tellin me in 7000yrs she didn't learn to defend herself in any other way than by changing things into other things. Her love story with Ikaris was more obnoxious then an angsty teen romance with a completely unnecessary sex scene that felt visibly uncomfortable to watch.Also Ajak was supposedly millions of years old and could heal herself and your telling me she was that easy to kill. Like she couldn't fight her way out of that situation. Yeah I don't think so but plot apparently demanded it and so it had to happen.Also I hated Sprite she's a nothing more than a brat. I get that she was angry for being stuck looking like a kid but how was that Sersi's fault. She even acknowledged that Arishem made her that way. She didn't even really love Ikaris just the idea of him really cause she jumped at the chance to be human and find herself a boyfriend (any boyfriend)Kingo and Karun were funny however when Kingo just up and leaves before the final showdown I was extremely disappointed with his character. Like he claims that Karun is important to him but just because he's too much of a coward to go against Superman cough I mean Ikaris he just backs out and is like sorry Karun I ain't gonna fight for your planet or your people nice knowing you see ya for work on Monday. Like what the heck.Druig and Makaari were the best part. I have no complaints about there characters except that they weren't featured more prominently especially their adorable flirtation. Most like likely they were cast to the side cause they aren't the standard Hollywood gorgeous attention seeking romance that the movie had in the forefront.Phasto was ok I don't have much to say except that was some good acting in the Hiroshima scene I felt his pain in that moment.Ikaris was predictable I called it early on that he would turn. Also nice try in trying to distract us by thinking Druig was gonna be the bad apple like no I could call that a mile off. Then of course he had to fly into orbit and look like Superman (which frankly y'all should be sued for that scene.) then yeeting himself literally into the sun. If I could roll my eyes further back into my head they'd be in my butt."
691,5,"This is not a bad movie... .. What this is, is a pretty bad Marvel film.If you think of this as an indie movie or a low budget production, with vast usage of open spaces, and easily filmed-in locations taking advantage of the superhero-craze.. then it might even be worth discussing. A copycat attempt that it's quite decent!Otherwise.. it is an awfully boring set of characters with logically inconsistent and unbalanced set of powers (for their purpose), terribly slow and dull dialogue, pointless additions (like the Deviants, that go nowhere, instead of using a completely internal struggle), world-building implications that unnecessarily affect the universe they created and don't really make sense physically, and poor addition/adaptation of someone's beloved character from the comics.I also found interesting and constant mention of other franchises I would rather be watching (Superman, Peter Pan, etc)..Like Cap Marvel, it can be completely ignored."
692,6,"'Fresh Lasagne is Actually FROZEN then Microwaved!' -""Kitchen Nightmares""- Director Chloé Zhao is the same as M. Night Shyamalan; after watching a trailer you are excited and count days for the release but then you start watching a movie you realize that fresh lasagne is actually frozen and just been microwaved. If you feel at that moment like chef Gordon Ramsay in Kitchen Nightmares, it is totally and absolutely okay because you thought you would be served delicious cuisine in a high end restaurant, but sadly it is not even the level of fast food.I am not an expert in comics and do not know how ""Eternals"" (2021) match their original characters but this movie is not even reaching the level of ""Spider-Man"" (2002). If Chloé Zhao planned to surprise everyone by computer effects, stunt tricks, and diverse / multicultural cast, sorry but that was not the main point. The main point was to not fail and made movie at least somewhere close to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), make an interesting plot with some twists (yes, scenario should be a bit better, or should I say complicated than in ""The Expendables"" (2010) or ""Death Race"" (2008). P. S: please no offense, but it is not ""The Courier"" (2020) level of scenario.), and introduce ""Eternals"" (who are they? I still don't understand.)Overall, the movie has a good cast, nice graphics, and some ""strong"" scenes. Some scenes I would even describe way too ""strong"" for the youth generation. However, maybe it is a new approach (""hook"") from Marvel Studios; ""Black Widow"" (2021) had some really nasty and offensive scenes, so ""Eternals"" (2021) are kind of holding their temper in some frames. Anyway, the movie was okay, not good, and not brilliant. If you watch it 1st time you will feel ""butthurt"" and will be bored but 2nd time you will probably say, ""it's not so bad"", and then eventually after 3rd time seeing it you will end up with, ""It's a ""lovely"" movie, but enough is enough."""
693,9,"Stop overreacting. Just enjoy it. Still better start than Avengers Are we going to accept the fact it's 2022? (ten years after the beginning of The Avengers). So, stop connecting this with other movies and just enjoy it. For me, It's a whole new level. For a movie filmed during covid outbreak, it's way too good. Having Angelina Jolie in cast is just marvellous! But it's still a bit confusing that the characters aren't as hyped as Avengers' and the cast also seems a bit off. I will look forward to seeing new characters in the next movies. So, overall perfect!"
694,1,"It made it to my top 10 WORST movies. Let me start by saying I'm a big Marvel fan and I also don't write many reviews unless it's epic or terrible. This movie was a giant waste of time. An hour in I almost fell asleep. By that point my wife gave up on it and left the room. About 2/3rds of the way through, I actually paused it to see how many more minutes I was to be tortured."
695,1,Worst than a bad Bollywood movie How can someone create something so bad it's beyond me. Please do not watch it if you care about yourself. The movie has so many inconsistencies and bad logics that it is driving you insane.
696,1,"Worse than Iron Fist...Worse than Green Lantern Easily one of the worst superhero flicks ever made-arguably the worst Marvel movie. There is zero emotional connection with the characters & utterly no chemistry between the actors. Then, there's the plot...needlessly convoluted & ridiculous. Terrible pacing."
697,5,"An Eternal Disaster? Review: Well, guess Marvel Studios can't win them all...at first I thought the early critic reviews were bogus, but then when I saw the movie myself, I now have to agree that those reviews are not far off. The movie had potential but it could have been a lot better.Takeaways:The Movie Dragged. A lot.Most of the Characters were not developed enough and explored enough to make us want to be invested in them. However two exceptions to this maybe are Angelina Jolie's Thena, and Richard Madden's Ikaris. Both of them are flawed out enough to make us interested in them.However fans of the comics may be disappointed in the MCU version of Ikaris.... It turns out that he is the movie's true Villian, and that Kro and the deviants were merely just helping him to awaken Celestial Tiamut, which would result in the destruction of Earth.The Cliffhanger ending was unnecessary.The Sex Scene was unnecessary.The movies main two Characters are Sersei (Genma Chan) and Ikaris.(Richard Madden)In this MCU canon, Ikaris must have inspired the Greek mythology of the young Icarus, who with his father, built wings out of feathers, but he flew too close to the sunthe Celestials mythology comes across as confusing. Both in the movies and in the comics. But the main concept is that there are alien civilizations that revere the Celestials as ""Space Gods"" but they are actually alien beings that possesses Godlike qualities but they are not. The only seeded planets but never created them. No doubt the MCU will soon introduce more powerful entities such as Galactus, and Kronos.Kit Harrington's Dane Whitman only has a very small role in this movie. However it does set up his future in the MCU. Fans of the Comics Will remember Dane for being the latest in a line of heroes to become The Black Knight. Without giving it away, there is one scene or two in the movie that hints of that being his destiny, and him becoming that Character (Eventually)However the End Credit scenes were Great and are great surprises for the MCU movie forward.(Such as Harry Styles Playing Eros, The Brother of Thanos. Though he fits more as a Character from the Guardians of the Galaxy than he does as an Eternals Character. Still enjoyed his cameo though.-Also...Was that Blade's Voice? (Maherhsala Ali)"
698,4,"Below par Poor acting, lazy storytelling. Am assured this is to set up a bigger storyline in the future, but am not convinced this is for the audience's benefit. One for Marvel Fanboys only, I feel."
699,1,"Horrible storyline While the visuals of the movie are moderately good, the storyline is as nonsensical as can get.The main characters carry out the orders of a god-like creature for 7000 years, and one week prior to the fulfillment, after 7000 years of unquestioned loyalty, they change their mind in a whiff. The explanation of this behavior is portrayed as shallow and implausible.More than that, the main character simply stops the plans of the god-like creature without much effort. She simply does that, making most of the movie irrelevant.One then desperately waits for the story to turn and resolve this underwhelming outcome, but the god-like creature simply says that he needs to reconsider his plan after 7000 years.'Eternals' is the archetype of a modern Hollywood movie that has cost millions in the making and yet no one cared about creating a compelling story.1/10."
700,3,"Terrible plot, great cast The plot is terrible and overdone, but honestly I think that's because the Marvel franchise has beat to death the same kind of premise for a decade now.Casting was terrific and I loved seeing the diversity and storylines. However I didn't love the storyline, it was never ending and really felt like they rehashed it from the avengers (thus Thanos), and I personally hated that the whole thing was a bit of a metaphor for killing wolves to save the population even though they are a keystone species. In the event they are whipped out, it throws everything off balance, and again creating the creatures to look wolf like further demonizes them."
701,4,"I tried I'm going to be dead honest with you, I tried so hard to like this movie but I couldn't. This movie is bad in so many aspects, the story, the action, the characters, etc. If you don't have nothing else to watch and just out of curiosity you want to watch it, do it. But you will regret as I did."
702,3,"Too Bad... I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have recently re-watched all the movies in order to the end of phase 3, and I love them, but this doesn't seem to fit. It doesn't feel like the other movies. I read in another review about not being able to connect to the movie, and I agree. I have tried to watch this movie twice, now, and I can't get through it. The characters seem to just be doing things for no reason, and the antagonist monsters just seemed made up so there could be something to fight. I don't get it. So, too bad, I don't know what happened, but I look forward to the continuation of phase 4, and I will go back to re-watching all the Defender's series on Netflix."
703,9,"Phenomenal. Hats Off to Chloé. I can't help but be impressed by the film. The story has been told really well. Not rushed nor too slow, just right. There is simply a lot of material to go through with the introductions of the characters, which is a crucial piece of the experience, and Chloé did all the characters justice in my opinion. She could not not do it. Going into the film that was what would have been the biggest challenge to get my head around, but my mind can rest at ease now, because that was well done.The CGI is arguably the best I've seen so far. Really impressive. Technology has come a long way.Costume and set design were also great and so was the cinematography to bring it all to life. Marvel films always get this right though. So no surprise here.Show is really well cast. Talented group of actors and actresses, but Richard Madden stole the show for me.I went into this movie with low expectations, maybe the psychology of that lead me to enjoy it more, but I see myself as a patient man that loves being fed relevant information and this film had loads of that and a healthy dose of comic relief. I loved it, but understand not everyone is like me."
704,1,"Boring, cringy, waste of time. Annoying characters and some of them even annoying actors. This was an extremely boring movie with cringy scenes. Tries to be the new ""Avengers"", but fails across the board. I wouldn't reccomend it. 2.5hrs of my life wasted..."
705,3,"Unbelievable low quality movie. Unfortunately Eternals had prove to be a waste of time, not because the actors were not good in their roles but simply because the story suck. Not worthy to be considered part of the MARVEL universe and most specially not a continuation of the Avengers story which was epical non the less. It seems that all the spinoff stories included in the MARVEL universe after the Avengers have the same problem: all the movies have been transformed from the status of fiction movies into fictions of a movie. Nice shots, nice special effects, nice performances but low quality story."
706,6,"Extremely underwhelmed I went in with high expectations, I was really excited. I watched Eternals on Disney+ as soon as it became available, and needless to say, I stopped half way through to go to bed. I didn't even crave to finish it the next day- the sensation to know what happened next was nonexistent for me. Finally finished it a couple days later and I was like, ""Wow, this was bad."" In my opinion, this was the worst Marvel movie to date. As I said, Externals left me underwhelmed.First of all, Angelina Jolie was just distracting. Incredible actress, but... she played a supporting role and she isn't the kind of actress you have playing a supporting role, at least in my opinion. Same with Salma, but her role made sense. Big name, minor role. Secondly, the way the deviant and celestial were killed at the end was so unsatisfying. Sersei just stood there for a good amount of time and then finally realized she could use her powers to kill the celestial? Like I understand she was apprehensive on whether she could kill the celestial or not, but she decided later- when the celestial was finally emerging- that it was worth trying? It was just odd and infuriating. Lastly, that ending credit scene with Harry Styles threw me off. I couldn't even hear the introduction of who he was because I was so distracted by that cgi leprechaun? Elf? I don't know what he was but it was bad.I think there was just too much to work with. First you have nine characters, which all needed their backstories. Then you had the deviants and eternals and the celestials, which all needed their own explanations. I believe making a series out of this would've served as more beneficial, maybe? Then it would have provided more time to throughly explained everything, because by squeezing it all into one movie, the story just lacked. As someone who doesn't follow the comics and watches the movies for fun, I was confused and had to look up more information on the who, what, why's of celestials, eternals, and deviants.Perhaps they should have allocated their budget better. The characters were great. Everything was pleasing to the eye. And for the most part, the special effects were great. It was just a lot too work with (story wise) and in the end, little payed off."
707,3,"Not the best. For this level of a film, with such a high budget, I expected much more. It wasn't particularly bad, it just wasn't any good. The dialogue itself was terrible, and basically the whole film was unnecessary. Watch this if you are a dedicated marvel fan, and get it over with, but othereise, stay clear of this film."
708,5,Decent The movie was ok. But the run time seemed like it went on forever. 2 hours and 37 minutes. All the Marvel movies I watch usually draw me right in. This on didn't. I paused it several times cause I just couldn't get into it. Finally made myself finish it. I'm not trying to dog the movie cause it wasn't horrible. But it definitely wasn't great. And it most definitely didn't seem like a Marvel movie. I'm glad I didn't waste any money to see it in theaters. The biggest thing that of course kept my interest was having Angelina Jolie.
709,4,"Too much characters and too many plot lines result in an unexiting, mashed up, but bold attempt of a MCU movie ""The Eternals"" should have been the next big thing in the MCU, directed by Chloé Zhao (Nomadland, 2020), ends up in something, I did not expect: A mess.The movie is beautifully shot, undoubtly.The cast has talents and actors, some well known (Hayek, Madden, Jolie), others might become upcoming movie stars. Most of them act unfortunatelly rather wooden and you might see that they are not that confortable with their role.Each Eternal has one or more ""super powers"", but all are different: One is like Superman (Ikaris, played by Richard Madden), another is like the Flash (Makkari played by Lauren Ridloff), some characters have some Dr. Strange features (Thena played by Angelina Jolie; Kingo played by Kumail Nanjiani; Sprite played by Lia McHugh), one is a Tony Stark like inventor (Phastos played by Brian Tyree Henry), one has the ability to mind controll (Druig played by Barry Keoghan). The leader (Ajak played by Salma Hayek) has the ability to heal.Against the enemies they are not that powerful as you might expect them to be. Quite a lame mash-up of a very specialized demigod team.In this first installment of the Eternals there might be too much characters (The Eternals themselves consist in this movie of ten characters) that are thrown at the audience. Each character might be complex, might have its own story and might be interessting but at the end only two or three get some empathy that I might care for them throughout the movie.There is a romance betweeen two (three) Eternals (Ikaris, Sersi, Sprite), two Eternals have African-American origins (Phastos, Makkari), one of them is even gay (Phastos), one Eternal is a Hindu and the living Mr. Bollywood (Kingo) and has a sidekick who films everything, one Eternal is from latin american origin (Ajak). Two Eternals have some Asian origins (Sersi, Gilgamesh), one Eternal looks quite androgynous (Sprite), some Eternals are caucasian origin (Ikaris, Thena, Sprite, Druig).What is missing in this whole cultural and gender mash up is a real transgender Eternal, a lesbian Eternal, a native American Eternal, a persian Eternal, and so on and so on ...The build up of the movie itself is not that bad with the jumping between the timelines to show the historic and private developments and interactions between the Eternals themselves. But the main story is not that interresting: The enemies (Deviants, just monstrous monsters with an Alpha) are quite lame, that the Avengers or parts of them or other MCU Heroes or Antagonists on other worlds of the universe might have defeated by themselves. The subplots come directly or indirectly with themes (p.e. Diversity, romance, evolution of mankind, war, violence and peace) that the movie can't swallow all at once.And, where does the final decission about Sprite becoming human come from? Some plot developments are questionable.The movie is not exactly boring, nor it is particularly exciting, but it lacks character introduction and character complexity (time to define each character individually), it lacks a fine, more focussed narrative for this first installment of the Eternals. It's a nicely shot movie without a soul or wit. It's all thrown at us at once and makes up for a mixed meal of some tasty ingredients and lukewarm rehashed.The End Credits scenes are rather laughable (Eros played by Harry Styles is just a joke instead of teasing a character for part two of the Eternals) and the secret of Dane Whitman (played by Kit Harington) comes so unmotivated and forced like a Deus Ex Machina plot device.Not recommended."
710,5,"Eternally making Marvel movies. The fact that 'Eternals (2021)' doesn't feel like a Marvel movie isn't an inherently good or bad thing. To me, it feels more distinct than most of the studio's other fare, but it isn't as entertaining. As a whole, the thing just feels a bit flat. It's messy, overly portentous and filled with some pretty baffling choices. Chief among these is the decision to have one of its characters straight-up disappear from the finale for no real reason, only to rear his head again just before the piece comes to a close. The ending (which includes two post-credits stings) is incredibly disappointing, evoking the exact opposite of its intended effect. There are plenty of other plot problems, too. They pale in comparison to the fact that most of the movie just feels fairly lifeless, though. It's pretty dull, to be honest. That being said, it does have its merits. Firstly, the cast are all really good despite the fact that they don't have much to work with. Ma Dong-Seok (here credited as Don Lee) is the obvious highlight, though he's criminally underused. Secondly, there are a handful of scenes which start to properly explore the interesting concepts inherent to the heroes' long-lasting lifespans. Unsurprisingly, the best of these involve actual conflict between the core characters and portray each player's different outlook on their unique situation. Sadly, most characters lack chemistry with one another and often seem isolated from the other people that share the frame with them. They aren't allowed to properly come to life, which is one of the biggest reasons that the piece just isn't all that compelling; we have nobody to care about. This also means that the movie feels as though it lacks real stakes, even though it's literally the entire Earth that's in danger. Without a character to latch onto, we simply don't give a second thought to the humans our heroes are trying to save. However, the feature is visually pleasing overall. The cinematography is suitably 'epic' and the various locations are presented with bold colours and distinct architecture. There are also a couple of entertaining, if slightly intangible, action sequences. The best of these, which is also the best portion of the entire affair, is a mid-point battle set in a remote village. For the most part, though, even the set-pieces fall short of the mark. Overall, this is a pretty disappointing film. It has a strange structure, a sloppy story and generally just feels a bit off. It's far too long, yet somehow not long enough; it would've been much better served as a mini-series. It has its moments, but it just isn't all that good. 5/10."
711,3,Brings back memories for the wrong reasons. This film could have done well if it was 45 minutes shorter. It reminds me of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood which took me 4 to 5 attempts to reach the end without falling asleep.
712,10,"It was an refreshing experience, One of the best movie of 2021 It was on of the best movie of 2021.I Appreciate directors vison: Chloé Zhao, she did an awesome Job.Hope to see more marvel movies form her.I enjoyed movie a lot it was good experience watchin marvel Trying to do something new then usual.Cinematography and visuals was excellent, and all the actors was at there best. Story was in good pace no complaint about length of movie.I don't understand why people hate this movie.Movie was so engaging and plot was well delivered.10/10 form my side must watch move."
713,2,"Awful Love the MCU and was really looking forward to this but what a disappointment. Could have fit the full story line in less than an hour, little or no character development. Not sure how, when cutting this, you could have watched and thought it was a job well done. Best bit about it was the end credit scenes."
714,3,"Not impressive Has it's moments, but mostly boring, generic and a waste of time. I am glad that the mcu can take risks, but if the risks taken are terrible, like this movie, then why? It could have been so much better, but all it is, is an epic story squished into 2hours and 40 mins, top 5 worst mcu movies. Avoid this nonsense."
715,6,"A character film with little character It's the Marvel movie that preceded the massively hyped Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's the movie that is directed by Chloé Zhao, who had just won an Oscar for her directing earlier in the year. It's the movie that boasted a huge star-studded cast from the likes of Angelina Jolie to Salma Hayek and now becoming huge stars Richard Madden and Kit Harrington. It's the movie that had a huge task ahead of itself but with the cast and crew involved it was sure fire going to be a great film, right? Right?! No.TLDR at the bottom.Eternals, right off the bat, showcases its VFX as the huge fiery sun takes up half your screen and then introduces us to our heroes and their abilities and it takes us through a narrative of how they need to remove the villains: The Deviants from Earth and that is their sole purpose; hence them not getting involved in any MCU event prior. Whilst this is the narrative that is sold to us from the start, it's a whole hour into the film we are made aware of the true narrative of the film being they need to stop a huge Sentinel from waking up and destroying Earth. It's the hour leading up to this 10-minute exposition dumb that just leave us lost. Their leader, Ajak is killed so we follow Sersi, Ikaris and Sprite on a recruitment mission getting the team back together. It's here we are treated with flashbacks of characters to, I guess, get some depth on them and their relationships but it just doesn't work. By the end of the film, I care for no character in the film, even when they're fighting each other.However, I do understand character decisions within the film making the writing clear and onto the point but just not with any dimension. I mean, once they find out that they're being used all the time to aid the resurrection of another Sentinel and planets are destroyed, no one has a believable reaction. Literally say one line in anger then move on. There is no sitting with a character and actually getting to know them, which by the way, half of this cast is put to the side line, they're barely in it. I feel there's so much story to tell behind every single one of the characters that perhaps this may have worked better as a show.Kumail Nanjiani falls into his comedic chops early on as he is the comic relief of the film with jokes that do start of as unfunny but they do eventually start getting a small reaction from me as the film goes on but to me the characters are: Ikaris (I'm aware of the flying too close to the sun thing), Sersi (We followed her for the majority), Sprite (I remember thinking I don't like Sprite), Phastos (Was reintroduced quite late in the film and he did cool things with his powers), Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, the guy with super strength, guy I thought was Ezra Miller, speedster and Jon Snow.Due to this, I didn't care for any stakes they had seemingly set up. That one scene where Phastos needs to take the sphere out of Sersi's body and its said ""Don't kill her"", implying there is a level of difficulty and tension to be had taking this sphere out. Within 2 seconds its out and they move on.Whilst the writing was flat for the most part, I didn't thing the film dragged. It was a 2.5 hour film and at no point did I want them to hurry up. It just felt I was on this journey with these characters and taking in what they're doing with some pretty cool action pieces every now and then. The VFX in battles was well done, as the tone of the film has much more muted colours than any other MCU film which makes the VFX colours pop just that little bit more whether it's the vibrant red petals from a transformed bus or the illuminating weapons as Thena jumps around the frame alongside bright red lasers coming from Ikaris' eyes. I really did enjoy the battles, they were brutal at times with ripping jaws off, ripping wings off, blood drenching a character; with these action pieces and the tonal difference sometimes, it was difficult to say this was a Marvel film until a joke was made. The action pieces were good but far in between.In terms of cinematography and soundtrack, there is nothing notable here aside from a few wide shots showing the team or landscapes were cool and really was excited to hear Ramin Djwadi's work on this, but the film portrayed a clear narrative with a score that helped it along.So how does this film fare in terms of the MCU and what impact does it have on the MCU? Unfortunately, this film isn't one of the MCU's best with 2 dimensional characters and a longer than needed first 2 acts, however it does introduce us to the characters so they can be properly fleshed out in future movies. With how the narrative plays out, the big eff off Sentinel in the Indian Ocean definitely needs to be referenced in future movies/shows as well as these characters as well as setting up Black Knight for future movies.P. S. I wish they included more speedster scenes; they were the coolest looking scenes in the film.P. P. S. Ikaris's final moments were quite bittersweet and one of the strengths of the movie.P. P. P. S. Bring on Blade!TLDR: An okay film that needed to be developed more within the characters but fortunately as it is part of a larger universe, that can happen."
716,8,"WATCH IT WITH YOUR MOOD, DO NOT RUSHED First time i didn't expect much from this mcu movies, because the review is a massive bomb and the critic hates it.I didn't watched mcu movies for a long time though, feels boring with mcu formula that has been used over and over againBut this movie?, I think this movie is way better than any mcu movies on character development. Ignore the critics and fly into it without knowing nothingAnd there you go, you've had a 3 hours mcu movies with better character, better cgi, and what a massive scale on this one, from the star power into vfx and the enchanted cinematography.You cannot missed this one, and i cannot wait for the trilogy."
717,5,"Nope! Sorry Disney, that's not how it's done. I dropped the movie after 50 mins, it's all about the story (or lack of it), I never engaged on it. Some scenes are overly staged for the movie trailers. Nope nope nope. Maybe when I don't have other series to finish."
718,10,"Marvel meets Malick, Villeneuve and Zack Snyder This movie is the first time in years that Marvel took a creative risk and broke their formula. Not only plot-wise, but also tonally and visually. Our heroes this time are not individualists surpassing personal problems in order to achieve greatness, nor are they a team a misfits putting their differences aside for a greater good. They are what amounts to gods, having lived among us for thousands of years. Yet, they are the most humanistic marvel characters ever put on screen. Their relationships are messy, just like any relationship between people who've know each other for so long, whith so many peaks and valleys that they all blur together.I've seen people saying this movie feels long, boring, cold, and I imagine thats what life is like for the Eternals, having lived for 7000 years. They've done and seen it all. Some just want their mission to be over. Others just want to be human and have a family. But at the end of the day is Sersi, the most empathetic one, who makes the others see the beauty and value of human life through her eyes. There is no villain, really, to be defeated. Just the apathy, strife and lack of meaning the Eternals all feel towards each other and towards the planet they've been sent to whitout their consent.Visually, the movie is beautiful, breaking off with Marvel's penchant for studio work and green screen digital filmaking, towards a more naturalistic style. Zhao has not compromised here, and the movie has very much the signature of her previous work. The nature of the storytelling reminded me very much of a Terrrence Malick movie, like The Three of Life, the sterile and alien production design is straight up out of a villeneuve film like Arrival, and the brutal, kinetic fight scenes between demigods is very Zack Snyder, especially Man of Steel.In the end, when time passes, I think this film will have a changed perception. I think it will end up becoming a cult classic among Marvel's portfolio. I hope the repsonse to it does not make marvel afraid to take risks like this one, and I hope this is not the last we see of Zhao on the MCU."
719,3,"Eternally good at appropriating Greek mythology This film was extremely long and with each added minute of run time came another dozen problems. It was completely cumbersome to watch with a plot that was all over the place, mingling scenes and times and characters. It felt as though the scriptwriters wanted to intertwine a bunch of ideas that they just brainstormed on the spot and this film is the product. Nothing is cohesive, this film was too ambitious with no depth to make it work.The biggest problem comes with the character. Their names are taken from Greek mythology without explaining the contexts or details. Supposedly the characters were to have inspired Greek mythology, itself, which is so degrading for the culture and saddening that impressionable young viewers may actually believe this. Instead of giving value to the culture that created some of the most amazing mythology, it doesn't do so in the slightest. The names are warped and spelled horribly, thus making any knowledgeable viewer cringe.What makes this worse is the fact that all other marvel movies try to tell the story of the culture (ie. Norse mythology in Thor) and do not use it as a mere method to gain more attention. Personally, this bothered me greatly as there are so many amazing pieces of work that cherish Greek mythology and utilize it wonderfully (such as Percy Jackson, targeted to similar demographics).In conclusion, this film is held up by its budget and effects, it would not stand on any other ground."
720,8,"I actually care about the Heroes I liked it. Yes, it is long. But....... I didn't fall asleep. This is one of the few Superhero movies I have liked. This wasn't just another CGI festival.The development of each of the Superheroes was interesting. Each is complex and has different motivations which causes intergroup conflicts that drive the story. The layers of human history thrown into the plot keep the movie lively. The acting was fine and I don't see how other reviews are calling it wooden.This movie was shades of Watchmen which I love. One of our Superheroes is clearly most powerful. There is a final showdown between our Superheroes. Our Superheroes have various affinities with us normal humans.If you want more than CGI fight scenes give his a try."
721,2,"An embarassing end of a franchise? Based on everyone's reviews I went in with very low expectations , but boy was I not prepared how pointless and cringe it could be. If you are a fan of the franchise - do yourself a favor and skip this one,let's hope this was a one-off and not start of the end of this decades long franchise."
722,4,"Ouch This movie was very hard to watch, started super slow and never really gained traction. The acting seemed forced and it was very hard to connect with any of the characters. This movie could have been so much more, hopefully the creators learn from this and listen to their fans, and make the sequel more enjoyable!!!"
723,8,"Fantastic film! I feel compelled to write this review given the mixed feedback. If you love history, mythology and a little Ancient Aliens you will enjoy this movie. I'm not a comics expert and didn't know much about the Eternals and that didn't stop me from being awed by this film, from beginning to the credits. It has rewatch value! Fantastic film and I cannot wait for the next release!!!"
724,3,"Unrelatable CGI borefest Take everything that's bad in ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings'', multiply it by 10, and also make it boring. Congratulations, you got yourself ''Eternals''.Too many characters - all of them shallow and not developed properly. Most of them have some unique quirk, and that's the closest thing that gets them near the 3d characters. I couldn't emotionally connect with anyone in this movie, nor did i care about the story at any point.Marvel honestly need to downscale their stories a bit, and focus on more isolated and grounded villains and battles. Every new movie has a world-ending conflict, and it slowly becomes stale.I don't think CGI was necessarily bad, it's more of a bad design, for both monsters and some other things, but this movie essentially is a CGI fest.Half of this movie is inelegant exposition. What's funny is that in all of that exposition they don't even bother to try and justify their diversity casting, different accents, etc., and purpose of that in the context of the story. Considering how the story unravels, and background of our heroes that we find out about in the movie, i think it was their obligation to make this make sense, because without it it's just insanely dumb and obviously thrown in there for pleasing the demographic and making easy money, and not for the sake of the story, which i just despise.In that same area of cons, it has a lot of general storytelling consistency problems, where a lot of minor things didn't work or didn't make much sense. Are these demigods bleeding blood? Are they actually all humans or that's just their form? Why is one guy occasionally wearing eyeglasses? Is his sight not good? Natives in some village in South America obviously don't understand English language, until 5 minuter later when they do understand it. These may sound like a petty nitpicks, but there are many of them there, and if writers/director don't pay attention to these minor details, when they already know that their movie is for sure gonna make hundreds of millions of dollars, i certainly can't turn my brain off to that and enjoy the movie. It also has some really unnecessary scenes, and even unnecessary subplots.Half of the jokes don't land, feel forced, or have a bad timing. Bad jokes and going back and forth in time, all the time, make the little momentum movie gets vanish. Climax is totally underwhelming and unrewarding, and definitely not worth sitting 2 and a half hours for it. My biggest issue is that the movie is not even fun, and that's really sad part for a superhero movie. ''Side'' romance couple have 10 times more chemistry than ''main'' romance couple. Actually, scratch that, main romance couple have zero chemistry. I expected better and more noticeable score from Ramin Djawadi, but i barely even heard it in the movie.Besides good cinematography, occasionally some cool camerawork, and couple of nice moments, i really don't have any positives here. I love going into the movie that has a bad rep with a mindset of wanting to love it. When i saw ''Black Widow'' opening credits i was shocked, and thinking that i was about to see the best MCU movie of all time, despite the bad grades that it was getting everywhere. Surely enough, as the movie progressed, i understood why so many people didn't like it. This movie didn't even start well, and that's all i have to say about it. Definitely one of the worst MCU movies."
725,1,"Not good at all Same with these superheroes stereotypes.They have power that they can show all the civilizations but they were afraid to teach technology, what a joke!"
726,7,"I love super hero movies! The Eternals are a new group of super heroes introduced to the audience by Marvel after the X-men and the Avengers.I haven't read the comics but i enjoyed that movie. As a Greek i like particularly the fact that half of the heroes are inspired by the ancient Greek mythology. There is also an international cast making characters more unique.The drama, intrigue, twist give a depth in the plot that makes it more interesting. I liked the interaction of the Eternals with the human race through the ages. The action is fast and impressive due to the multiple camera angles and direction. There aren't any new super powers we haven't see before but all heroes use their powers in a most efficient way with the help of the special effects. I Didn't like the costumes too much and Jolie's character condition. I think this is a good start for any new sequels that may follow."
727,5,"It nice movie bust slow movie I've decided to watch it not because I wanted just because my friend invited to go together. Well, it wasn't amazing, I wasn't surprised in any good way, it was just an average movie with some great but also some awful special effects. The main idea was really bad, plot was very messy and hard to fallow, even The legend of.... was better movie, this one was one of the worst Marvel's movie so far."
728,5,"Great movie I've decided to watch it not because I wanted just because my friend invited to go together.

729,5,"Just a distraction If you need something to watch to kill time, it's OK. Started out with scrolling text that friended now poorly the film is. I kept watching it due to them playing Pink Floyd hoping for more. Hard to connect and didn't explain things any better than the initial text. Drink a little wine first."
730,10,"Perfect. So much diversity representation, from disabled people, lgbtq+ koreans , pakistani... Just wow for that beautiful message of union.Loved them greek mythology hints, them thanos and superhero references... Particular the superman reference in an MCU movie... Good acting, great cinematography, overall... 10."
731,7,"Great movie with lame story How comes that a 200 Million Dollar movie production can't hire some people to analyze the story, find plot holes and fix them?Actually I really liked the movie. The special effects were great, maybe one of my absolute favorites so far. It had this usual Marvel humor which I also appreciate a lot. It makes these movies fun and entertaining, instead of weird and pathetic if they tried to be 100% serious (like old Marvel movies). The director did a great job, the actors were great, I can't think of any exceptions. Could have been one of my favourite Marvel movies...But, the story just doesn't make any sense at all, therefore the whole movie evening somehow feels useless and wasted. Of course it is Science Fiction, so everything can happen, but still the story should in this fictional universe make sense. Maybe I missed something but for me, the story went like this:Arishem puts his ""seeds"" in planets such as the Earth, to create more Celestials. These wait/ or grow inside planets, until the Civilisation on the planet has reached a certain population, because they need an ""intelligent energy source"" (whatever that is). They grow inside the Earth's core (where most of Earth's energy is), but they need the humans for something. Actually, if they ""rise, the rip the planet apart, so never really use their ""intelligent energy source"" anyways. But still lets imagine they need the humans to rise. So Arishem sends Eternals to earth to kill the Deviants so humanity can grow, and a new Celestrial can be born. Why wouldn't Arishem tell the Eternals, after living thousands of years there of course they would get attached? One of the Eternals Druig, his only power is to control people, could totally speed up this process, and make humanity reproduce at a really fast rate. But no, Arishem tells the Eternals to let humans kill each other and decrease the entire population, because the Eternals shouldn't intervene. Why? If they only need humans as an energy source, then why bother?It just doen't make any sense for me at all, and I won't even start with the whole uni-brain thing.I am wondering, if the comics, these stories are based on also make that little sence. I never read them, so I can't tell. In my opinion, if they create a movie, they should have a conclusive story, no matter the original.I still give it a 7/10 because everything else was really great."
732,1,"Not worth your time ) This is not worth your time. The plot is okay, but the manuscript is weak, the main persons are too many, the scenes are ragged. The a ting is ok.This movie is very different from what you excpect t it to Be since it comes from Marvel.The story is too long, and have to many back and forths and does not end properly (especially when it comes to the monsters) . It could have been an A movie, the potensial was there, but it ends up being a C-movie."
733,3,"What A Waste and Disappointment from Marvel Took me three days to watch this movie. I love diversity as much as the next person but it felt a little forced. And the characters were not developed, no back story, Angelina didn't belong here. Just an all round bad movie. I hope there is no 2nd one. Take a few years off, recast and bring it back."
734,8,The best marvel movie of 2021 but it requires patience This is one of my least favourite formats for movies. You have to spend first part of the movie building their entire world and history to frame the characters and their situation. Of course it pays off later in the movie but I would have to consider the first 30 minutes of this movie to be quite boring. After the first act it does pick up pace but also fails to get interesting quickly as I did think this movies plot was going to be quite predictable. The latter half of the second act and a third - proved me completely wrong and there are plenty of surprises and twists. And for anyone who ever read the comic quite a turnaround on some of the characters. It is a slow boiler and while some of the comedy misses it's target quite enjoyable but with an excellent and dramatic ending. I would also have to question some of the accents which makes no sense considering the age of the characters. But I certainly hope to see future eternals movies.
735,5,"Too much attempted, not enough achieved. Years ago, when this film was first talked about, it seemed like a really bad idea to me. Introducing 10+ new characters, with no backstory, just seemed like a recipe for failure. The Avengers, for example, took 6+ characters, each introduced in at least one film previously, and seamlessly gave each solid, nearly equal screen time as the story flowed together. The Eternals, not so much. Flashbacks inserted randomly to try to explain the character's motivation made the story very choppy. A handful of references to the larger MCU were forced and throwaways.In fact, the only positive of this film is that they killed off or removed half of the characters by the end. Clearly, it was too much for the writers as well. This is a one and done movie - forgettable. And that is the worst thing anyone can say about any movie!"
736,8,"I loved it! I'd generally consider myself a Marvel loyalist & I'm fairly well versed in the comics, but I'd never heard of The Eternals. That said I walked into this film (steaming now that it's on Disney+) with very low expectations. I didn't hear much buzz surrounding this film (odd for MCU at this point in the game) but what I had read online wasn't spectacular. I decided to watch it & decide for myself. I'm SO glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it! Bravo!I love a whole new fresh set of characters that were beautifully developed, with an imaginative storyline, gorgeous visuals & a fresh approach to the tired out hero trope. The emotions here were raw & real. I felt connected to these heroes by the end of the film. Also this cast is INCREDIBLE (side note bringing Harry Styles into the MCU was a plot twist I didn't know I needed in my life)!I've honestly become bored with Marvel after 16+ years of films, but this was a welcome change! If it didn't make box office expectations I think it's definitely due to poor timing (released a month before the final Spider Man installment) & the fact that these are entirely new characters for most MCU fans. Audiences have grown lazy & don't want to be forced to venture away from what is familiar. Change is good people!I'm glad Marvel made this film & I'll eagerly await the next installment! Give this movie a try & don't let reviews prematurely dictate your opinion. Watch & decide for yourself!"
737,10,"Change of pace for Marvel is refreshing I understand that some people thought there wasn't enough action. There's some of us who like adventure without a ton of fight scenes and guns blazing. There was still plenty of action, but it also had a more philosophical approach. One of my favorite parts of the Thor movies is the interlacing of old mythology into current stories, Eternals does that as well. For me, it adds depth and resonance making it more enjoyable than the average action movie. I really hope they make some sequels."
738,3,"Parting the Red Sea An opening crawl should be fun like the original Star Wars. Gives you a quip about the story and sets up the chess pieces in the story.Eternals long opening crawl is a confusing mess.Muddled story with forgettable superheroes that do things we have seen before.This is a movie of the week from a universe that should be gearing down. The days of the superheroes are starting to fade.It happened with the cowboy genre - pirate films - epic films ... the sun is starting to set and this is a bloated example of poor writing , execution, and casting."
739,3,Skip This Marvel Film The Scope Of This Was Way To Vast To Cover/Introduce In One Film. Overall Seems Like A Pointless Film To Make Apart From Introducing Dane Whitman/Black Knight To The MCUSersi Was Hard To Connect To As A Leading Character And The Rest Of The Cast Seemed More Fleshed Out And Interesting Could Happily Of Watched This As A Disney + Series And This Would Of Given Them More Time To Achieve A Better Connection To The Eternals.
740,4,"Bland Very hard to connect with. I kept falling asleep and made myself stay awake just to finish it and still felt disappointed in the film. It was to much jumping back to past memories. Not marvels better work by far. Very, very subpar. I don't think I could stomach watching it again 😫"
741,4,"Ambitious film crushed by its own weight Out of the 3 Marvel films in 2021, this one had the potential to be something unique and different with the scale of the story and characters that it was trying to deliver. Unfortunately, now along with Black Panther this ranks as one of the weakest entries in the MCU.It's also been the most controversial one as it split the fan base with, I felt unnecessary bias and negativity. The diversity message was pushed far too much in the media and the promotional interviews by the cast. That alone doesn't make a great film, that is a sum of many parts, great cast and acting, directing and most importantly a well-constructed story. I watched this film on the merits on what it was trying to tell, rather than being led down the path fuelled by that negativity.Unfortunately, 'Eternals' tries too hard to tell a story that spans 7,000 in a running time of 2 hours and 36min, it simply isn't enough. There are too many characters to try and flesh out over this running time and this is one of the films biggest weaknesses. 'Eternals' would have worked better as a limited series on Disney Plus rather than the big screen, where it could have been given time to fully breathe life into the story.The film jumps frequently to flashbacks to fill out the missing blanks, this just doesn't work as it fails to connect us and empathise with characters. It felt all too cold and to be honest it just added to running time.The films other weaknesses, the casting choices and direction.A film can live or die on the main leads, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden have zero chemistry and their acting abilities are wooden at best. Gemma Chan appears to have stepped off one of her other shows 'Humans', where she played a robot. Her emotional range here is so stunted I cannot believe a better performance wasn't coxed out of her. Richard Madden is just channelling Rob Stark here.The only performances that are noteworthy are Lia McHugh (Sprite), and Lauren Ridloff (Makkari) who manages to pull off better acting without uttering a single word.Acting veterans Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek add zero acting gravitas to the proceedings and look uninterested by the whole thing.Chole Zhao is out of her depth in the both the story and direction. It was a brave decision to go from small Indie films to big budget multi-layered complex stories such as this. She'll learn from this hopefully and will be better prepared to handle a film of this scope. The action was flat and lacked any creativity also which could have elevated the film past its other shortcomings.'Eternals' had a massive $200 million budget, but somehow manages to look very cheap at times, the effects are subpar. I need to single out the creature designs of the Deviants and their participation in the film. As one of the protagonists in the film they fail to make any impact, this is down to the creative decisions visually, and finished CGI which is terrible at times.It's shame because under all this there was a great film screaming to be unleashed, but as it stands it's just ok, and is just an expensive steppingstone to introduce the characters into what I hope will have a better impact in the MCU."
742,6,"Skeeter Davis... Best moment was when they used ""Skeeter Davis' hit ""The End of the World"".Okay maybe there were a few other good moments. But 2:37 minutes of anything that does not have a super layered story like ""Lord of the Rings"" is excessive almost masturbatory film making. A lot of edits could have been made, tightening the film to a reasonable two hours without losing an ounce of story. Long shots of this, characters staring into space, things of that nature could have been excised.I fail to see how a sequel would be enduring. Or needed."
743,5,Meh.. Gemma Chan was bland and lacked the energy. I think she was a bad choice for the lead and probably all comes down to the writer/director.I struggled to keep my eyes open.
744,6,"A Sloppy Mix of Characters and Story While we are treated to wonderful special effects and a crazy world of energy it is easy to get caught up in everything that happens.It is hard to connect with the characters after the amount of times they had betrayed one another. You just couldn't feel for them at any other point in time. Overall the backstabbing had covered up the main villain, which the whole story lead up to him only to disappoint the crowds. The storyline was all over the place and it was hard to convey what was happening at certain points. Aside from all that, the movie was far to predictable. It followed most formats that come from other movies: a team of superheroes reassemble, the villain trys to stop them countless times, they find a way to defeat the villain, one of their team members join the villain, they defeat the villain. The film wasn't horrible, the historical context was neat, but felt like a waste of time. One part that really annoyed me was how Batman and Superman were incorporated into the film. They acted like they were just characters in a movie. The moments they looked down on the DCU seemed like something the director only wanted to add in so they could actually be remembered in MCU's history. The movie wasn't great, but it wasn't bad, or at least, that bad."
745,2,"Another boring formula Like most of the films churned out from the MCU factory - the action scenes are terrific and that includes the visuals, sound fx etc. Don't forget the forced humor which can be a hit or miss.Eternals started out slow and for some reason dragged on during the middle part of the movie, it's just that they added so much unnecessary paddings and subplots that don't really add anything to the movie. ""Humans are bad"" etc are so cliche now, like many other themes shoehorned in will sound so preachy it's an eye roller. Add to that they bounced off the story to many different timelines along history with the humans having very unrealistic reactions towards the eternals.7000 years is too long, one would think it would dramatically change the thought processes or personality of the main characters but, no. Marvel has this problem with thousands of year-old characters, they are still bound to their original personalities seemingly unaffected by the times like it was just a month ago. And so the main character learned how to use her skills only at the end."
746,1,"An Eternal Nightmare I can't believe Marvel made something so lame. We wanted the nightmare to end but we had to wait 2 hours, 37 minutes, and 42 seconds. Despite seeing the reviews, we still watched it, as we are the biggest Marvel fans ever. But sadly, this movie was a complete letdown. The only possible saving grace was the CGI, but everything else? Don't waste your time."
747,9,"Amazing visuals and a gripping storyline. A very interesting look into the cosmic lore of the Marvel uni(multi)verse. It connects well all sorts of historic events to the Eternals' presence and does a good job telling past and present plots. The visuals are stunning, the battle sequences are fantastic. Apart from a couple of out-of-place comedic reliefs and ""god ex-machinas"", I loved this movie from beginning to end."
748,10,"Fun! Magical! People really are hating hard on this but I honestly loved it. I do think it would've done better as a series, but I hope they follow through and do a second movie! I really like vibes marvel has been putting out lately with Shang chi, the Loki series, and now Eternals. It feels like they're having more imagination with films instead of the same boring superhero plots as usual.I like that they had fun with the cast too. As someone who in the last wasn't a huge fan of marvel, I loved this. So maybe you will too."
749,1,"Horrible direction, storyline and acting! What a joke! Nobody could act on this movie. Worst direction ever! It was the worst marvel movie ever. They should stick with the superheroes. Jolie lost her touch as well, surprised she took in this role? Borderline racist with Indian characters. Save yourself the three hours!"
750,1,"Lifeless First of all I have no idea why Hollywood superhero movies are nowadays made so dark! Why arent they alive, bright? Eternals are supposed to be cheerful & not depressed. All characters seem so sad & dull as if going through a breakup. After watching this, I had to switch on to a bollywood flick to cheer up. Worst Marvel movie."
751,2,"Wow, it deserved all the panning it got. I didn't like a couple of the other Marvel movies but those weren't unwatchable. I just didn't much like what happened or that it tried to be a comedy or how they treated my favorite superheroes. This is a truly bad movie.We love the actors and we tried to like it. But no dice.It's not a terrible concept but it was handled terribly. The plot and the dialog are truly bad.The first Marvel movie that needs to be put in the vault without a sequel."
752,8,"Thoroughly Enjoyed this Movie! I thought eternals was great! I really enjoyed it from start to finish and I thought it did a good job in telling the story - plus the CGI was excellent (apart from the hand at the end which looked like Bryce from 20 years ago).This is a family friendly movie too. I have seen many people complaining about the 'gay kiss' - which was entirely in context and not gratuitous - and I say to those people who were horrified by it (yes, many) get with the times and stop being bigoted.So yes, great movie, great cast, great story and great CGI. A worthy addition to the MCU and a break with the stale old characters - who I also loved but which probably do not deserve any new outings going forward."
753,2,"Absolute disgusting This is not a war, is a genocide. Wtf, this is not history, is bullshit.A nwo compendium movie where you create a deaf eternal hahah, it's a joke.The only good thing is the CGI, the awesomeness of the celestials."
754,2,"Epically Boring Slower than the Hobbit reboot, along with little to no explanations. It moves too fast between the good parts and much too slow between the dissertations. And why can't Thena help? We already experienced this with the Kind Hulk. Don't waste your time."
755,4,"Brief history of humankind All the small moments didn't work or cringe worthy(never thought I'd used that word). The big CGI moments are just that. And if there was ever overdone theme in SciFi, it is 'To err is human' and we have our saving grace.Beside the disaster failed logic not to serve the grand universal design but instead save humankind, just as glaring is the bow to Bollywood and others to gain more global market shares.The flaws of big bad superhero movies all happened in this one 1) the inability to create tension. Yes there are action scenes and internal conflicts but with so many characters this would have been better served in a series 2) no connection to the everyday audience. They tried the humanization thing but again too short a time. We don't have any investment. Plus we really don't see them live badly, or have daily struggles. 3) drawn out storyline (especially true with the dependence of multi MCU movies)So boring."
756,5,"So many words...So little else What a run time. I was looking at my watch the whole time. My wife went to bed and simply said this sucks. She loves MCU. This is not MCU. This is a little blip we'll forget about. Move along now, nothing to see here."
757,7,Its good 👍 It's a whole different movie. It's good with slow story writing but overall portrayed amusingly well from different marvel movies. Definitely unappreciated.
758,1,Big waste of time movie If I only knew what I was going to see?I would rather watch the Smurfs movie again!Too much effort for CGI and VFX while the sceenwriting and directing were a disaster.
759,3,"I don't know.... I have very little idea about what went on a lot of the time in Eternal. Maybe it's just me, but I found it confusing and mostly mystifying. Still, I liked Richard Madden, Gemma Chan, and Angelina Jolie. Looks like there will be an inevitable sequel, so maybe I'll figure it out after that."
760,10,"its a marvel film! This is a perfectly good, inoffensive film that i would recommend anyone to watch especially if you like marvel since this sets up many things coming in future projects, idk if its a 10/10 but it definitely doesn't deserve a 6/10 from critics who have never left a positive review in their life. Watch it anyway you can, you wont regret it."
761,2,Bad Poor script Terrible acting. Not worth your time unless you watch it for free like I did on HBO Max. Hopefully they don't make anymore more of these. Not one character was intriguing.
762,2,"Good plot very badly presented coating it with CGI There's no need to spoil any content because there's no content to spoil. The plot and story has huge and nice foundations. But as the story roles, you just get lost in to an Avengers type of story searching to rebuild a team and defeat an unrealistic end of story line.I know, this is Marvel univers and realism has to be taken with a grain of salt. But each character fails to bring an attachable story so we don't really connect with one or the other. As for the somewhat interesting character of Angelina Jolie, we have no backstory, actually, no story at all.It's a movie bundled with CGI creatures that seem indestructible. I mean, the eternals feel so weak facing these creatures that the movie just makes you grip your chair's arm rest to refrain from forwarding the movie if you could.And they put John Snow in the background with an end credit that only hard core fans will understand since there is nothing to the eye that can make you understand anything.For those wanting to see it, it's just a visual CGI fantasy movie that can be skipped to my opinion. It got a 2 stars because the story is interesting, something about celestial beings mis-managing their sublime powers for stupid archaeic reasons that the Eternals decide to fight against. Story is good, but presentation feels like the streets during COVID lockdown, EMPTY!"
763,2,"Bad comic book worse movie Not sure why Marvel would have green lighted a movie based on a comic book that has no following but here we are. Wonderful actors, beautiful special effects, horrible storyline."
764,3,"Too much going on There Where not alot of backstory and it felt very pushed, they did not focus on the Marvel theme and went downhill, this movie felt more like a dc movie, with alot of heroes with stupid powers that make no sense. Like how could a mighty god think shapeshift was a good idea? And they tried too push comedy but fell short, only the indian producer was funny.. very dull and dissapointing movie for me atleast... hope the next one is more thought through."
765,1,"Complete garbage! They had a great chance to make a good contribution to the Marvel Universe, unfortunately they blew it big time! This movie sucked so badly that it was difficult to sit through. The premise for the actors set up was ridiculously stupid! What an embarrassment, if you can't put together a good script then don't bother!"
766,3,"Sorry fanboys It seems that since Disney acquired the Marvel Universe that their story lines have dumbed down a bit. There was no reason for this film to have been over two hours. In fact the last half hour would have been enough. That said, it was more like a bad episode of Power Rangers."
767,1,"Weird casting. Really boring. Lacking in every aspect. BOOOORRRRIIING! A 2 hour and 37 minute yawnfest with weird casting. I couldn't get past only seeing Jon Snow and Robb Stark both in love with a character named Sersi. I can't be the only Game of Thrones AND MCU fan who found this very distracting. And I suppose the action was there but with such a slow pace, lackluster acting, a boring plot and a weak villain ... Wait, who even was the villain? Oh ya, I don't care. I didn't care about anyone or anything happening in this film. Live, die whatever. At the end of the credits after the added scene when ""The Eternals will Return"" flashed on the screen, I could only groan with dread. PLEASE don't return."
768,10,"nice movie The film is wonderful, the filming and directing the story, many will not understand it because it is the beginning of a new era in the Marvel world, but I am sure that the next parts will separate the events well, do not worry, fans of the Marvel world, this is only the beginning."
769,5,"Not your typical Marvel Okay, this is not your typical Marvel movie, with the sex scene, the middle finger etc, usually my 5 year old is allowed to watch these movies but not this one. He will not be free to just watch, whenever it comes on tv, we're not comfortable just leaving it on. We have a 10 year old and even he said the sex scene in the beginning was ""cringe"" It doesn't show a full sexual scene but just enough context to make you wonder if it was necessary for a Marvel movie."
770,4,Way too long and boring 😴 The movie didn't really need to be over 2 and 1/2 hours. They could have cut out at least 40 minutes of the movie and you would not have missed anything. I am a huge MCU fan but I really hope they don't make a sequel to this particular movie. I also normally like and watch Angelina Jolie movies but she really doesn't fit into the MCU world. Hopefully they are not trying to incorporate her Into the Marvel movies in the future.
771,5,"Lacklustre and predictable I watched this with anticipation but was very disappointed. The production was great and the cast did a reasonably good job. But the story was weak, cliched and predictable. This is now all too common - great focus on the cgi action and a patchy story. There were too many flashbacks at the start and the sex scene was unnecessary. Then too, hearing an eternal being like Phastos speaking with a pronounced American accent was jarring and just didn't fit into the ancient setting. Some of the scenes and dialogue seemed flippant though the movie did get stronger in the second half. It's still worth seeing and there will be a lot of viewers who will find the movie praiseworthy."
772,3,"Speechless... As in ""bad""... Basic dates that do not add up, poor research over mythology from different cultures... But the worst part is the script, again. No substance, no empathy for any of the characters, whom, by the way, betray and forgive each other every 20 minutes or so. Really, really a poor film..."
773,3,"Warning spoiler !!! This film is awful, all over the shop, hard to follow and extremely boring. I hope there isn't a sequel.Also how bad is IMDB for making me write this bit at the end coz apparently my review isn't long enough."
774,4,"The Worst Marvel Movie! After the trailers I lowered my expectations and the actors, the writer, and the director even dived under that mark with no problem!It began slow, but after the introduction of the characters the the story didn't pick up speed. It's a way too long movie and the boring story telling and lame acting made it even longer. They missed a chance for another good Marvel. I really did like all the other Marvels except 'Iron Man 3', which was unfitting into the whole series, but the 'Eternals' fouled up completely.In the beginning there was good music, but with more and more time the music was replaced by a score, which was nerve-racking dramatic - totally misplaced. Sometimes it was schmaltzy over the top.It was one of the worst disappointments for me this year. The top of the disappointment were the stilted dialogues. Lame show! The time jumps didn't make the movie better. Some scenes looked awesome, which couldn't prevent me from being bored over the whole runtime that felt like 5 hours. A.recommendation for insomniacs."
775,8,"A Start towards Change With this movie, I can very much say that this film is indeed very different than what you would normally see in a marvel movie, and I have to applaud it for its efforts for not going into the same ""marvel formula"" that we would see. I went into this film fully expecting it to be horrible but as I finished it, I actually ended up really liking the film."
776,4,"Please Marvel - don't go down this road. I wanted to like this. I really did. But Marvel, if you are setting this for the baseline of what comes after Avengers- I don't want to go. This didn't cut bait for me. I watched it ONLY because it was Marvel. If it wasn't, I would have turned it off within the first hour. And the tease at the end is Starfox?? Eros?? I actually hate this whole thing. Please DC pick up the slack - this is your chance..."
777,3,"Wanted to enjoy it... Saw the negative reviews and thought it can't be that bad.For a 2.5 hr movie, it feels like it's 40-50% complete at best. With lots of characters and great scenery, the movie shows a lot of history with extremely little development. The background is still very unclear, the future is unclear, and the actual story feels very bland.I felt almost no connection to any of the characters and that they had no depth or growth.I've enjoyed most Marvel movies, but this one just seems far below their usual quality."
778,1,"I'd give it 0 if possible Do not watch this movie. It's beyond dull and very very slow. I'm a big Marvel fan and I've seen every marvel movie so far, so was excited to watch this with my other half... we keep trying to watch it but half an hour in I turn to my other half and say ""I think this movie.."" he finished my sentence with ""is dire? Yep it really is"". This is the first Marvel movie I've ever been unable to finish or watch due to the awfulness. Spare yourselves the pain, anything is better than this movie."
779,1,"Slow, boring and tedious This is the most drawn out and tedious rubbish, if they had cut 30-40 mins out of the movie it would just have been a poor movie as it stands it is a drwan out and boring movie, we gave up with 30 mins to go."
780,6,"GOTG Did It Better So first of all, I went into the movie knowing all the bad reviews and scores, but unsurprisingly, the movie for me wasn't as bad as everyone says, it's just bland, it's not the worst thing every and it's certainly not the worst MCU movie.It's just that the movie is forgettable and bland. Half of the characters are bland and forgettable, the scenery for the most part is bland and forgettable (most of them due to the fact that the director insisted on using natural lighting, especially in the jungle scene).The movie had some very good ideas that were wasted on this mediocre plot which needed more time to develop.Another good idea bad execution situation here. They could have made a better movie with a better plot with this story they had.The lore is good, but how they explain it and the way it unravels and how the twists and turns happen could've been executed way better. The lore is really interesting and for a 2 hours and 37 minute movie, I wanted it to go deeper into the lore, but it was disappointing in this department.As for the characters, I don't really care for any of them, especially and obviously the ones we saw less of. Even after watching them for 2:30 hours, I still have no emotional attachment to any of them, which is a 180 from other MCU movies, especially from Guardians of the Galaxy, which I don't think I need to explain much on why and where these two movies are similar to each other.James Gunn did what Chloé Zhao couldn't; he made a movie about a group of character that 98% of us didn't know anything about and made them relatable and engaging, made the movie's plot and storytelling coherent and not convoluted and gave us a fun movie with great rewatchability value.The glaring problems with Eternals are;And I don't think any of the actors did a bad job, it's mostly the writing and the characterization that makes them bland and uninteresting.Now things that I liked, I like most of the actions, especially with Ikaris and Makkari.It's amazing how Marvel can do better Superman and Flash fight scenes than DC. Makkari is what I want to see in a Flash movie.I really liked the music Ramin Djawadi did, I thought it was great and memorable. It's the most memorable thing about this movie.I also liked the lore and the story as a whole, but as I've said, the plot was mediocre and they wasted a big potential with the lore.I heard someone say that when you watch the movie, you realize that Eternals didn't need a series to dedicate an episode to each of the characters, and after watching the movie I... kinda agree?But at the same time, when I think about it, the characterization and especially the plot and story needed more time.This is another mistake from Feige's part. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier would've worked better as a movie (with a better plot and writers of course) and Eternals should've been a series instead.Because they tried to put so much in this movie that contributed to its failure. Why cram all these lore and story into a 2:37 hour movie and make a 4 and half a hour show about TFATWS with a simple story?Also, the lore is kinda similar to Mass Effect's, but Mass Effect did it better. It's kinda unfair to compare a 2:30 hour movie to like a 50 hour game, but that's the point exactly.In conclusion, it was way better than I expected it to be, based on the ratings and the reviews, but it ultimately fails to deliver a coherent movie with relatable and memorable characters like GOTG did, and it's very long and mostly boring and bland, but I'm still interested to see in what direction and in relation to MCU they take the story and its characters next.I was gonna talk about more stuff but I'm struggling to remember what they were because I already forgot about most of the movie lmao, so there's that too."
781,3,"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz I can't tell you what happens. Not because I want to avoid plot spoilers, but because it's so dull I fell asleep three or four times.Paper thin plot, wooden acting, lack of adventure, no humour, faux drama.And I so wanted to enjoy this movie."
782,6,6.5 Decent film let down by the run time. This was a long film and the first 75 mins are tough going. There is some serious pacing issues due to the length. The final act was pretty good though and actually exceeded my expectations after reading some reviews. All in all I thought it was okay with some good performances but not one I'd rush to watch again.
783,3,"Errrrrrr What was that? Have I missed something? I tried to watch it but I just couldn't get into it, it's boring and in my opinion very poorly acted, I spent the entire running time saying whaaaaat!I can't get my head around how bad this is and how disappointed I am."
784,7,A very different Marvel movie Considering it's based on a collection of comic books written to explain about the creation of Universe in the Marvel setting it's a pretty good film. Whether you agree with with the concepts or not is in my view irrelevant. The fact the film explores them is worthwhile.
785,8,Great Don't know what so many people complaining about. Ppl full of...u needed to think a lot more for this marvels movie and doubt many of those giving poor reviews are able to do that..
786,4,"Flat characters with a soulless storyline Characters are hard to relate to, storyline harks to a group of superheroes who lived another life centuries ago, think of 'the Incredibles' but without the heart, inspiration, humour and acting skills to back up the weak storyline. I'd like to see a new Marvel movie where they don't explain or mention the 'blip' or Thanos. Move past it, start something new, there are some amazing writers out there, aim high, aim for originality, and for Eternal's sake, a story doesn't need to rely on diversity for diversity's sake."
787,5,"Not good enough After the movies and series we are used from Marvel it seems they are running out of juice. Yes the effects and acting is good. But the story felt like ""this is the mandatory exposition for the next phase"".I found the 'let's put in some old hits' move lame. Has been done plenty enough now.Expected much better.The one redeeming factor is Gemma Chan, she's a delight."
788,4,"A bit too melodramatic I get that they are trying to make something more adult friendly for aging audience of the older Avengers movies, but this ain't it.It copies a bit the formula of ""bad"" Thor movies. The melodrama is awkward and get annoying. A lot of weird stares between characters and of course a comedic relief character who has basically no additional value in the story.Trying to do many themes at once often leads to not making good use of any of it. Adventure? Fine, got a nice set of locations there. Romance? One of the weird couples has involvement in the story. Is that enough? Action part.. a lot of strange battles with somewhat dysfunctional superheroes... stranger than Doctor Strange.To me it does not have any depth, and it is boring despite the fan service in couple scenes. One point above complete trash like Captain Marvel."
789,3,"Worst Marvel Film This one is a total shitshow! No humour, no seriousness, just fuckin boring. How did Angelina Julie agree to this?! Why did that Alien talk? Where has it been all along, where did it run to? Nothing makes sense. If you are bored, still don't watch this movie."
790,5,"The Worst Marvel Movie so Far. I was not a huge fan of Captain Marvel. I thought Brie Larsen was stale and ran through the motions. At least Captain Marvel had a plot. The Eternals is rushed plotless movie with no true back story. There is way to much going on for 1 movie. To me, this is the worst Marvel movie so far."
791,9,"Scratching my head I wasn't expecting much as I'd listened to the reviews but I really enjoyed this film once I knew what was going on.If I'm totally honest, I found that some of the CGI was suspect but on the whole, I wasn't mad at the film at all..!Just goes to show that everybody has different tastes."
792,4,"Why is Icarus a villain? This was a mediocre film that needed a twist of some kind, but making Icarus a villain just isn't the way to go. Disappointed. It's one thing to alter a characters origin or storyline, but have them be a villain just isn't right. Would have been a 5 if this hadn't happened but it's a 4 for me. Wished they played more with the Black Knight and I believe that is Blades voice at the end of the credits."
793,2,"No Nic Cage Boring, contradictory and long as balls. Hilariously, the trivia for this film says they didn't use much green screen. Mini Nicola Sturgeon was the highlight, though Nicolas Cage could have made this film truly spectacular."
794,4,Superhero movie thrown together without a coherent plot I have just watched this and I am not sure what really happened - from the dismissive reason why the Eternals weren't involved with Thanos to the fact that the Deviants were created by the same entity who created the Eternals and for what purpose really? If Salma Hayek and Richard Madden have really perished then I think they did themselves a favour.
795,7,"Got more than what i expected I watched the movie with no expectations. Firstly the cast made me doubt. I think Salma wasnt the right fit amongst a few others. But it grows on you if you keep an opened mind. The greats on this were: the eternals are more god like roles with a more sense of responsibility for the whole planet,I felt alot of the messages being conveyed are that humanity exists for a purpose and were aided by extraterrestrial life forms that have been visiting us for thousands of years. This is just a theory but has gained attention in recent times. Secondly it reminds us how pathetic and great humans can be. And that we all have a part to play for the greater good, lastly in principle the storyline demonstrated a viewpoint of how we should not believe we the only intelligent lifeform in the universe together with the influences and interests that has built up humanity. I lile how the director added these pieces. From entertainment to visual effects i enjoyed it and would like a bit more fight scenes. This movie felt more personally real that with other marvel movies. Like or dont like it....all our views are subjective.enjoy!"
796,2,"Lower your expectations I'm a huge MCU fan & I can see that this movie is lackluster compared to the things they been doing. Even if you just look at this movie not comparing & see it as it's own, it's still a very rushed, mediocre, not paced well mess. Don't let your love get in the way of your vision."
797,3,"Worst MCU Movie I can remember Bad acting, storyline and disappointing cast - most of the actors do not fit into their roles.I was waiting the whole time for a hook but was very disappointed.Can't remember that I watched a worse MCU movie."
798,10,"This movie changed my world PLEASE LOOK PAST THE FLAWS!!! In no way am I saying that it is perfect. But I am absolutely spellbound by this movie. It went above and beyond to represent minorities and did not make it forced or absurd. Everyone should watch this movie. As a matter of fact, corporations should make leaders watch this movie. Just 15 mins into the movie, I had to get a box of tissues. People can't accept flaws and of course people can't deal with minority representation of this scale WATCH THE MOVIE."
799,3,"OMG.... horrible The two best parts of this movie were the popcorn & the movie being over..... Seriously, I was bored and over the movie about 15 minutes into it. Just terrible."
800,2,"Marvel still proving that you cannot cover a .... in glitter and make it something else So it was a film about a major catastrophe end of the world in a cosmic rebirth... PLEASE Let this happen, so we do not have to watch another one of these disastrous films again.We all live in a age where CG can make a film become alive, magic and full of wonder, we've seen it all. So if any studio believes that this will cover terrible storylines and directing, it doesn't. Fortunately for us the next hinted sequel will be getting us all reaching for our pocket money and heading back to the cinema for another 2 hrs of head nodding, in which CGI cannot save."
801,3,"Eturdnals It's a shame because the comic was full of potential but never felt part of the wider Marvel universe - it's Matbels first genuine misstep. Not just average , it's bad. Really badPoorly constructed, scripted, acted, directed. Doesn't feel like part of the MCU but more like a poorly conceived low budget TV show.Clearly thinks it's better than it is but it looks cheap and isn't remotely dramatic or funny like it thinks it is.Hopefully it's the last we see of these characters."
802,7,"The Most ADULT of the MCU Honestly , I don't Dislike this movie , but I also don't LOVE it yet at least!! It's filmed Unlike ANY MARVEL movie we've seen thus far .. the cinematography is beautiful, fight scenes and effects are complex yet simple.. it's experimental with sexuality.. as well as more graphic sexually than any other MCU movie.. the characters are hard to bond with Vs The other MCU hero's .. Once again.. it's a good movie .. just at the moment for me at least .. not up to par with the others!"
803,4,"Bad casting, boring, fail Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie, what?! Horrible as super hero's! Garbage! Each character has some cool abilities BUT they faded out or underwhelming. The drawn out movie was so boring and parts unnecessary. No real big fight scene or cool over the top fun, just ok, nothing exciting here."
804,4,"A very bad movie with no heroes This movie is one long exposition interrupted by occasional pointless fighting. Don't worry though, even though its complex I'll make it easy for you to figure out the protagonists and the antagonists. The 'good guys' are, literally, nobody and everyone in the film is a 'bad guy'.Asharam is God, I guess, though so stupid his own creations keep banging his b-hole and he can't stop them. The 'defilers' or whatever the dog things are called are bad because they can't escape an ice canyon but apparrently can fly through space and go to new worlds and eat people because...reason...?The eternals are bad guys because they either want to stop new life to save old life or because they want the other way around, or even both I guess, its complexity w/out being poignant.They keep talking about other heroes but who do they call when everyone on the Earth is going to die? No one, that's who! Its a job so important that Icarus doesn't end it when he has 42 chances to because...reason.Don't worry, the ending sucks pretty bad too. Lastly, if you are looking for a little racism we got that too! It seems that eternal robots are created to look like different races here on Earth and, though they have been to thousands of planets, when left to their devices they like to just associate with people that look like them...the space robots. Yes, space robots can't get by race very well, but they can have accents and one they forgot to build with no ability to speak because... you guessed it...reason.Really just a bad movie."
805,10,"NO! I disagree with the negative reviews! No! I disagree with the very bad critics. This is a very good movie. I'm saying this without knowing the source material. So my review is based solely on watching this movie, without any acquired knowledge of the source material beforehand.The story is more interesting than what most comic book movie adaptions have to offer, due to its more philosophical approach. The story is also coherent and well paced. Too slow you think? No it's not! It's just allowing enough time to develop the characters of the Eternals and their emotional bonds among each other as well as the inner conflicts each one of them has. The Eternals use their powers consistantly during the movie, which gives the viewer stunning visuals and entertaining action. This movie is not boring!I read another critic that the Deviants hardly show up. I can't understand this critic. They are a recurring threat, from the very beginning, to the very end of the movie.The acting is good, not spellbinding, which is absolutely fine for a comic book adaption. My favourite performances are the ones from Madden as Ikaris and Nanjiani as Kingo.Be open to more than just a movie filled with some generic ""two super heroes face off in the streets of some big city"" scenes. Allow your mind to wander a bit and be open to the world of the Eternals."
806,1,"if anyone enjoyed this movie, that's fine.. ..and I don't want to be the one to seem to be above the rest and all.. but for me this movie was one of the worst BS-flicks to be produced on such a large scale and that by a studio which delivered the whole MCU pieces..I did not enjoy one single bit of it!Salma Hayek should have found some other part to revive her career, and for Angelina Jolie: if anyone needs somebody with nonexistent facial expressions, go for her. It's like looking on a print-out of a face slapped to a head..It is just ridiculous, nothing makes any sense and it all seems very forced. If you can watch it for free, go for it - but don't waste any money on this BS. Even that idiotic Shang-Chi is far better and that was very, very bad.."
807,3,"Fairly shallow Marvel experience... Another year, another Marvel Studios superhero movie, right? Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn't exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.And that was the case with the 2021 movie ""Eternals"" from writers Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo. This movie was all flash and bang and no proper contents. It was all essentially just pointless eye-candy.For me, then we are talking about a swing and a miss for Marvel Studios with the 2021 superhero movie ""Eternals"". When the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of 'what did I just waste two and a half hours on watching?'. And I was also left with a sense of none of the characters portrayed in the story had any significance or backstory. You might as well replace them with mannequins and still end up with the same movie result.You would assume that with a cast ensemble that included the likes of Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Lauren Ridloff among others, that you would be in for a stellar movie experience. But nay, director Chloé Zhao didn't rise to the occasion to deliver a wholesome and entertaining superhero movie. Nope, this was a lukewarm movie at best.The total absence of properly written characters and character development throughout the two and a half hours of runtime was just atrocious to witness. And it totally turned the movie into a shallow experience. Yet, I managed to sit through it, but believe you me, this is not a movie that I will ever be returning to watch a second time. There were so many characters to keep track off, yet none of them had any properly written backstory, character traits, personalities or anything, so they just sort of blended into one singular faceless mass. And hence, I didn't care one bit about any of the hero characters, because they were about as interesting as mannequins.""Eternals"" was pure and simply just eye-candy in term of entertainment value. The storyline would have been more interesting if the story had interesting characters, subplots, etc., but there was no such thing going on here.Sure, I am by no account a fan of the superhero genre, but watch the movie regardless, but ""Eternals"" was definitely among the top contenders for being among the most pointless and boring of superhero movies.My rating of ""Eternals"" lands on a three out of ten stars."
808,4,Not that good This film rambles on. The run time you s eternal. The origin story is muddled and trite. I'm so glad I did not pay theater price for this. I have to pad my review like they padded the runtime of this film. Crazy dull movie.
809,5,"Bad acting What's with the bad acting?! Even the famous actors and actresses acting was very poor and bad, as if their contracts states that clearly ""Act as bad as you can""!Specially the fake Jennifer Lawernce, she's emotionless."
810,5,"Too long and very mediocre Just doesn't do the source material any justice. It feels like the director was told the basics of the characters and just went, ok let's make a movie.Utterly bizarre to take 3 well known male characters and make them female. It completely changes their entire back story and how they experience life. It was equally bizarre to take Kingo, a Japanese character, defined by his samurai armour and fighting style and turn him into an Indian Bollywood actor, I mean come on. Utterly ridiculous.The movie was just slow, with easily an hour that could have been left on the cutting room floor. With a storyline that just didn't really draw the audience in. Everything about the storyline was predictable and well, bland. Can see why this is such a low rated movie and why people aren't bothered about a sequel.Also, just soo many basic mistakes. The Sahara 7,000 years ago was grass covered, with trees and lakes. Why they showed it as a desert was bizarre. Makkari using the wristwatch sign before watches had been invented? How did not one writer say, er that doesn't make sense. And the police sirens making a weird noise? How did no-one say er that's not the noise police cars make?"
811,7,"Better Than Expected, Great Story Expectations were low, as are average review scores, and was was the box office performance.What's Good:-1) It looks superb, visuals up to the standards set by previous MCU movies.2) The story is great, and as more is revealed, the viewer is greater engaged.3) The trademark MCU humour is present, to great effect.What's Bad:-1) The story felt shoe-horned into the MCU. I wonder if it would have been better as a stand-alone movie. The plot devices used, and the ""routine"" dialog about the Avengers etc, felt a little forced and retro-fitted.2) The cast was let down by the performance of Gemma Chan. I thought she was a little wooden in Humans, but given the robotic nature of her character, it worked - but not here."
812,1,"I'm Shocked It Was So Bad Spite lived on Earth for thousands of years and speaks Spanish like she just took a middle school Spanish course. The jokes are flat. The acting is stilted. I'm surprised this is a Marvel movie. As WTH?!...Celestials are born out of planets that are populated to a certain point, but couldn't just wipe out the Deviants. It's such a strange choice for a movie plot. It is a bad movie. Such a disappointment."
813,3,Worst Eternal movie is totally Worst not good story for Marvel this is not super hero movie Angelina Jolie character is totally worst . It's my favourite but don't like thena in this movie.
814,1,"Worst movie of 2021 I could start talking about the characters, but I really wonder, is there anything remarkable? Sersi is nothing, she has no personality, she has no background, no motivation, she does not interact, she does not even react to what is happening around her, her only function is to stop Ikaris, and talking about Ikaris, he becomes the villain, his ideals are at least something remarkable in the movie and it would have been nice if this had been properly anticipated. I don't even want to talk about the other eternals, because they are all the same, something that is empty, without personality despite having interesting conflicts that are never well executed or their presentation is given in the most boring way, an example is Phastos creating the nuclear bomb and therefore going to live in the suburbs with a normal family, and the rest of what happens is boring exposition and something else that I can't mention, but which is extremely gross and unpleasant. The story is bad, the music is as generic as possible and the visual effects are ugly, it's garbage."
815,6,"I think it is useless to MCU!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I believe that marvel should make several movies before this so we could get to know more about every characterBut introducing the twelve characters in one movie Made this movie in a mess I didn't connect or affected with any character especially the ones who diedAnd finally the acting was too awful , especially the main characters , that also helped me not get connected with the characters."
816,4,"Boring Man, I remember the Eternals comic when I was a kid. I don't remember much about it but Marvel is going through their entire library and making a movie about every comic and every character.This one should have been passed on. It was a chore to get through. Cliched fights, super boring and one dimensional characters, some miscast and it just doesn't seem to fit in the Marvel cinematic universe even though they comment on other characters in the movie.Too long, I hated Angela Jolie the most and I really gave this every chance but I was just bored from start to finish.No. You don't need to make a movie about EVERY Marvel comic."
817,2,"lack of back story, poor narrative, mediocre acting...only fair effects! I´m missing old marvel heroes, with NO botox and NO funny accents! The mediocre story does not forgive! There are NO connection to the Marvel past and NO connection at all between movie senes. Unfortunately new Marvel movies are just a waste of time!!!"
818,8,Fantastic Those who have put a bad score on this movie don't have the intelligence to grasp the imagination it took to produce a story like that. It was marvellous with link in various thing like the Greek mythology. Marvel movies are usually popcorn movie but this one was way more. Watch it for yourself you'll be pleased.
819,6,"Storyline is good. Execution was poor. Eternals had so much potential and I actually find the storyline quite interesting. It sets us up for the next phase of the MCU. However, the execution was just bad. The cast had no chemistry with one another and I find myself not caring about any of them. Angelina was great because she was in character the whole time. The valet man also carried the whole show for me, his humor was executed perfectly and that says A LOT since he was just an existing role. He was great."
820,1,"Horrible, utterly horrible Can I have two hours of my life back?If Marvel had spent 10% of the effort they did on the actual plot as they did making sure every race / creed / religion was appropriately represented they might have made something decent here.They did not, and the result is a shallow, soulless movie, with uninspiring characters, bad narratives, and just a lot of nonsense."
821,5,"Worst Marvel film to date. The film was boring!I think the issue is that the character development is poor but that's because we're being introduced to 10 plus characters at one time!I get its probably a starter for 10 and will fit in elsewhere with this phase,but not going to watch again .Only bit I liked were the post credit scenes as they hint at future stuff."
822,1,"Marvel finally made an actually bad film From the opening explanatory text - always a bad sign - through the wild mood swings, the boring fight scenes and the fact that they change not only Ikaris but the entire Deviant society and its relationship to the Eternals, this is a real clunker. I had to watch it over several nights, it was so uninvolving. None of the emotional beats were earned, the acting was flat, plotting and dialogue were uninspired and as a whole, it doesn't bear watching.A truly awful film."
823,1,"By far the worst MCU movie This movie can be summarized as: cringe and messyIt repeats many of the mistakes of past Superhero movies, which the MCU mostly avoided so far.A few things as examples:It tries very hard to make the characters seem cool, detached and aloof, which I assume the director imagined gods or aliens would be like. But this just ended up making the characters feel bland and uninterested (think: Superman)The storyline is messy, the characters are not introduced well, the viewer builds no sense of connection to them or any immersion"
824,5,"Less This movie is imperically, objectively worse than the entire MCU.It is also slightly less pointless than most of it.I did not like this movie. I do not like most MCU movies. I can appreciate what this movie was. I can appreciate what the MCU as a whole has done.However, I didn't like this movie because it was just bad, not dumb. The others aren't bad, just dumb.For the introduction of the black knight, and Makkari, I thank this film.Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos was the best actor here (and among the best in the entire MCU,) and Nanjiani as a superhero slowly became acceptable near the end.But it's a poorly made movie, with very little ""Disney charm,"" or ""heart,"" especially considering the studio it came out of."
825,6,Nice idea but Dragged out to an extent that it was boring. Also should be separate from the MCU in my opinion. The actual storyline idea I liked though which surprised me.
826,2,"The Worst Marvel Universe Film Ever What a bore - ""Infinity Bore"". A muddled mess. Zhao has blown totally that which make Marvel films fun to watch - engaging characters (Jackman's Wolverine, Downey's Ironman, etc), and fresh, fast-paced storylines."
827,1,"Please be advised I have never wrote a review on IMDB. The only reason I am writing this is in the 1/1000000000 chance someone from Marvel reads it.The cast is stellar, the visuals are amazing, but the script and dialog are awful. The movie seemed very slow at the beginning and then rushed at the end like they were not sure how to finish it. Many of the side comments and back stories that play a larger role at the end of the movies came across as filler and lacked real purpose. I am not sure how this movie was pieced together but the formula for this movie was the worst marvel has ever used (mind you, I enjoyed all versions of the fantastic 4, which many did not). I was so excited and so very disappointed all in a near 4 hour window. Spider-Man: NWH and Avengers: Endgame can be 3 1/2 hours because I have emotionally invested 13 years to their build up. I have zero emotional investment in this film based on B marvel characters. I need to time to learn and invest, not have their histories force fed at high speed. I recognize and understand that it may seem like these characters should be easy to relate to because they are taught in most 7th grade classrooms across the country but people attending this movie haven't learned Greek mythology in at least 10 years. A 13 year old would love it but the 23 year old that grew up watching Iron Man in 2008 has long since forgot who Athena is.Again. I loved the idea, the cast, the visuals, almost everything (and I know a lot of wonderful people worked so very hard on this film) but the part that matters most needs flat out redone: depth, dialogue, and delivery."
828,2,"Is this Marvel or is this a romcom? As a Marvel fan is this one of the lauzy movie I've ever seen. This is more romcom than Marvel. And again... it starts in... UK... really?!?! Why not for example in India? Disney, don't be a cliché! Some of the casts doesn't fit of their character."
829,3,"A trash masterpiece at its best. Boring, weak characters, poor dialog. The question is for it required 2.5 hours to express such rubbish? Don't watch it even if you are in a deserved island and this is the only movie available to see. 3 stars only because of the monsters effects and fights."
830,6,"Something was missing By opinion, this is Marvel Studios weakest movie yet. Don't get me wrong, it did have some good parts, but just felt like it was lacking something when it came to the story and actions scenes when the characters where in combat. It did open up the MCU even more with some impressive characters and and how they come to be and also opening up new potential movie ideas. But I don't want to give to much away.The only reason why I give ""Eternals"" a 6.5/10 and not a lower one was because of how it opened up the MCU, so that you have a good idea of what's to come in future films. If it wasn't for that, I would've given it a 5/10. I'm quite disappointed with the story and action, and that's why. I think Marvel Studios was trying something and unfortunately it just didn't work."
831,10,Outstanding Movie Before watching the movie i read so many negative reviews that i was quite surprised after watching this movie how great it actually is. Sure it's not an Avengers movie but understanding the nature of planet earth's heroes including the coming of the FF and X-men this story needed to be told. Like many other story lines the did follow the comic lines but it was good. Before you write negative reviews try to read some of the stories involving several cosmic Beijings. It was not an action movie but the history of an introduction of more heroes. Watched the movie for the 2nd time this week and it is even getting better!
832,3,"One of the worse movies in the MCU genre I could sum up the whole movie in one word - boring. We can argue about the amazing CGI or the runtime being long, whatever maybe the internals of the movie. Any movie of any genre should have have the bare minimum of thing i.e. Entertainment, which this movie completely lacked."
833,3,"Worst Marvel movie !? I have watched all Marvel MCU movies and most Marvel series without missing even one, and this one falls very, very short.This was just appalling the story was ok.. the real crime here was the dialog it was stiff, vacuous and unnatural, paired with a weird script it was hard to watch. The top tier cast could not salvage this train wreck.I am not familiar with Chloe Zhao's work and carrying the Marvel enterprise on their shoulders could not be easy, but if this film is anything to go by I will steer clear of her future endeavours as she does not have the flair to make a film entertaining beyond technical execution."
834,6,"Screams of my Deep Disappointment ""What Did I Miss?"" ""Nothing. Just the Screams of My Deep Disappointment""Chloé Zhao's Eternals is indisputably ambitious, definitely had lots of potentials, and it may as well be regarded as the new stepping stone for the Comic-book features, still, the true spirit of Marvel's conclusive identity is sorely neglected here. MCU has been around for roughly two decades now, they have gone through some rigorous undertakings in the past, had to put up with lots of risks. Yet for me, they never renounced their charisma or their distinctive presence.Eternals might be the first time I beg to differ!Now, being unique isn't necessarily a bad thing. Especially, if you have a set purpose and a strong-willed attitude, nothing would stop you from being yourself. However, Eternals doesn't seem to have any of those qualities. When you think about the events that have unfolded up to the present time, their very existence poses some serious questions and doubts.Just think about it, In a normal scenario, with such incredible powers, and an unprecedented authority over the universe, this stature alone should grant them the title of invincibles and would set them (Eternals) apart from everyone else, right? But that didn't happen? Did it? Guess why?It's simple, they never earned the right to their titles. At least, not in this MCU's timeline. (Hardcore Comic-book fans may differ). It appears as if their powers have been rather gifted than rightfully obtained. Unlike the Avengers or any of the prominent figures who have been a part of this cinematic universe; we didn't see the ups and downs of their lives, we haven't had the privilege to be a part of their uprising. Thus, these powerful beings fail to bring out any sort of feelings in us. I believe, relevancy is crucial when it comes to Superhero fantasy tales.People love Superheroes not just because of their magical powers, it's also because of what they symbolize, because of who they truly are from the inside. Eternals did have an intriguing set of Characters, with all kinds of stupendous abilities one could dream of; however, it's the humane touch that they are heavily deprived of.Although, I must show some acknowledgement towards its outer appearance. Congrats to Miss Zhao, she has managed to put together one of the most beautiful looking Marvel films to date. Even more so applaudable when you consider the fact that this is her first time taking on a big project and that too of such a staggering scale. The incredible score and the gigantic sets have only elevated her excellence. Had the Writing been bounteous, things would have been much different."
835,4,"What a messy movie Movie has too many characters but lack of characters depth, slow pace story line, bad screenplay, boring action sequence. Bad and horrible Indian portraying and presentation. Is this what Hollywood thinks about India and Certainly about Bollywood. What a crap. Writing department did all the mess with this movie. I thought Captain America First Avenger and Thor the Dark World were the worst movie from Marvel. This movie succeeds those to suck even more. This is a pure arrogance of Marvel to produce any movie to be overconfident to make money.I didn't give a damn when ever a character was dying. Only 2 characters were good.It's bad to see Batman and Superman jokes used in a marvel movie. Batman and Superman are the most favourite superhero comic characters in the world.Now coming to character writing. How come an Eternal is Deaf and yet she is has super power. If they are not human doesn't it mean they won't have human disability. This is called stupid writing.Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were only good characters. Angelina Jolie was wasted. Kit Harrington was there for no reason at all.Mesopotamia Civilisation was done so badly.Too much blue, purple colour used for the civilisation. This is what happens when you lack story and screenplay writing with research about the civilisation.Couple of shots were beautiful such as Sun set shots and The tree scene were Angelina Jolie was painting. That's all.Cinematography was good. Locations were good. CGI was hit and miss. Music was forgettable.Too many unnecessary characters."
836,4,"Worst Marvel since Thor The Dark World I couldn t believe how boring this film was when it was half way through. Unfortunately it didnt get much better in the final. The characters get enogh screentime but the dialogue is just boring and worst of all tries to be emotional and epic at the same time. How could this pass quality control from a studio that brought us so many great hours of entertainment? Those Characters already need a reeboot after their first attempt. Just dont watch it, save your time."
837,1,"It was like an unbearable Hemorrhoid I see superhero movies as simple entertainment, so I started watching it with little expectations, but it became unbearable very soon, poor direction, forced narrative, poor character building. All in all it was a complete trash."
838,1,"So incredibly bad. I really, really, really tried.Had to stop after 30 minutes.This was beyond bad. Every.single.part.Would not watch the rest of this unless someone paid me to watch it.It was laughable. In a very bad way."
839,7,"Convenient But Captivating I can technically call this film the mother of all origin stories, because it does indeed take us back to the beginning when the so-called gods and goddesses of yore nurtured human history on Planet Earth.Artfully explored under Chloé Zhao's direction and well-written by her along with Ryan and Kaz Firpo, and Patrick Burleigh, Marvel's ""Eternals"" was one of those 'long movies' worth sitting through. Check my blog (link in bio) for the full review.The ""Eternals"" story featured elements surrounding immortal beings who originally helped shape Human civilizational history. The movie captured some interesting and captivating themes, each well-imagined and better executed. Arishem (voiced by David Kaye) was the originator, i.e., Prime Celestial.In keeping with the concept of 'all things in balance' - light-dark, good-bad, yin-yang - the movie introduced an opposing force called the Deviants who were not humanoid like the Celestials but monstrous and bestial. Arishem called upon the Eternals dwelling on Olympia to help him defeat, or at least, counter, the Deviants. Plenty of inspiration from Greek Mythology, if the names of some of the Eternals and their home planet hadn't already given that away.Then there was Ikaris' obvious 'DC established' Superman-like powers. Great performance by Richard Madden but lazy writing (more on this in a bit) didn't quite make his characterisation praise-worthy. Much the same could be said of Makkari's Flash-like powers. Leave DC alone, Marvel. #CoExist.The contemporary shots and sequences in the film were good. Apparently, all the Eternals were still among us, distributed across different geo-locations. None of them 'interfered', though, which sorta beat the entire purpose behind why Arishem even sent them to Earth in the first place, all those centuries ago. If fighting the Deviants could be termed interference, they could have helped fight so much 'deviant' human corruption and crime over all this time.What I found truly disappointing in ""Eternals"" movie was that very plot-element, about why these so-called goddesses and gods never interfered in Human endeavours, and our many blunders. It felt like a direct contradiction to their full-fledged involvement in human affairs later in the ""Eternals"" storyline. They were 'allowed' to step in only if the Deviants came on the scene, as the movie clearly showcased.The monsters first showed up in Mesopotamia (most of present-day Iraq and Kuwait) in 5000 BC. Babylon (south of present-day Baghdad, Iraq) in 575 BC saw the Eternals shaping early civilization. Ikaris and Sersi tied the knot during the Gupta Empire (North India) in 400 AD. They went up against the creatures again in Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico) in 1521 AD, but did not intervene in the cross-civilizational war that ensued around that time. Phastos lost faith in humankind at Hiroshima in 1945, for obvious reasons - he found it again later through family.Since we're on the topic of 'divine interference', or lack thereof, it is only fitting to state that Marvel Studios has been releasing titles that are interconnected in some lore- and event-based manner to their overall MCU Phase Four. I'm sure many a fan will agree that the silence from these same Eternals when Thanos destroyed half the universe did not (at first) sit well - story and plot wise - with their current purpose in the film.Dane voiced my doubts on screen, but alas the answer was obvious. Even the Eternal Druig questioned Ajak on it, but again, it was in vain. I know I shouldn't blame the original comic for inspiring this plot-element, but oh well. When I tried to come up with alternatives, I believed this original 'setting' was ideal to create a sense of 'conflict' in the Eternals storyline, though a terribly stilted one where such powerful entities stood criminally underused.The odd and abrupt timing for the Deviants to return five centuries later and target the Eternals - who were asked by Ajak to split up and live their lives among humans - in the modern era felt like another 'convenient' addon to the movie. It set an awkward tone so early in the film, to be honest, like they wanted us to feel the 'press of time and history' surrounding the Eternals. It was all rather disjointed.After all these centuries, the Alpha Deviant (Kro) could heal himself, which added to the challenge in stopping him. Weird how the others believed he killed Ajak, though - she had, quite literally, goddess-grade healing. Ikaris has been a busy backstabber. Anyway, Kro proved, for the first time, capable of self-healing. Sprite correctly guessed he might have absorbed Ajak's powers, impossible as it seemed. Also, Sprite's 'identity' concerns were disturbingly relevant and thought-provoking in the movie.The flashback in which Thena went berserk and attacked the other Eternals was another strange plot-choice - of all the characters, honestly. The concept of an Eternal experiencing 'Mahd W'yry' was interesting, but a shade contrived. It was probably created to lend them a sense of vulnerability lest their deific power make for obstacle-free storytelling. The idea came from the comics in which it was referred to as 'Eternal madness'.It felt natural in the comics, for some reason, but too 'in your face' in the movie. If not for Angelina's noteworthy performance, her character would've suffered more than the occasional bout of Mahd W'yry in ""Eternals"". They later redeemed this 'abrupt' plot-angle through the reveal of Arishem's deception. I assume they sub-textually tried to convey the difficulties of mental health through the Mahd W'yry concept, but I can't be sure. Thena's 'moment' when Gilgamesh was killed by a Deviant made for heart-wrenching viewing.I had to remind myself that the movie was based on human-created stories not actual verified history, so there were bound to be discrepancies where divine involvement was concerned. Moving on... Kit Harington's character Dane was human, which added to the admirable plot-balance in ""Eternals"". It would've been overdone if they'd made him a god too. His referencing Doctor Strange was nice - another classic MCU touch right there. Other MCU character references were great too.Kingo's Bollywood number, though - not a fan of how they portrayed it in the movie, sorry-not-sorry. Ajak's conversation with Ikaris about the complexity, cruelty, and beauty of human existence was familiar yet profound.Arishem's explanation about the Emergence, and Tiamut (the Communicator) was outstanding - loved every line, and its implications. It was one of my favourite things about the film, to be honest. That the higher-order Celestial Arishem lied to the sub-divine Eternals all so they could safeguard the 'fuel source', namely humans, to ensure the birth of another Celestial Tiamut... Fascinating through and through.Earth would be destroyed in the process, though. That's when the plot twisted. The Eternals, having lived here this long, finally realized that they needed to interfere and stop the Emergence. They learned that they'd even fought the Deviants only so humans would be safe enough to reproduce so Tiamut could gather the energy he needed to be born.Sersi's realization of the Celestial conspiracy - and there being no Olympia - to keep the Eternals subservient and forgetful of their unwitting planet-destroying services was a splendid plot-layer. That Arishem created the Deviants to ensure the evolution and proliferation of intelligent life-forms on various planets... It was all so cunning, and dark - savoured every one of those twists, I did. That the Deviants evolved and became predators made it necessary for the Eternals, whom also Arishem created - almost like A. I. with emotions. Arishem's 'design error' fib was breathtaking in its simplicity.Other than the 'convenience' angle I detailed earlier, characterisation remained outstanding throughout ""Eternals"". The visuals and looks that framed the movements and appearance of each deity was spectacular and memorable. The multifarious Deviant 'creature designs' were exquisite. The Celestial designs were intimidatingly good.Ikaris's betrayal was brilliant, strangely reasonable, and unexpected. The 'Alpha Deviant' Kro and his evolution was superb - he died too conveniently quickly, sad. The last half hour (give or take) of ""Eternals"" was thorough and enthralling. Ikarus (similar to the myth) took his own life by flying right into the sun, the guilt of his deeds too unbearable. That dratted 'convenient' plotline notwithstanding, ""Eternals"" managed to deliver the classic Marvel fare we've all come to expect and desire. What was Dane's family secret? What will be the fate of some of the Eternals whom Arishem reclaimed? He said he would peruse their memories to judge if the human race was worthy to live.Pre-credits scene: Makkari, Druig, and Thena were on a quest of their own to rally other Eternals across the universe to their revolutionary anti-Celestial way of thinking. They encountered fellow-Eternal Eros (played by Harry Styles) and Pip the Troll (played by Patton Oswalt). Eros knew where to find the others. Implications! Post-credits scene: Dane Whitman's 'secret' was partially revealed when he opened an ancient chest that has apparently been in his family for ages. He was greeted by the vampiric Ebony Blade itself, the one made famous in the ""Blade"" franchise. Mahershala Ali was recently cast to play the titular character. Ali's off-screen voiceover - ""Sure you're ready for that, Mr. Whitman?"" - cinched the promise of his future coming. This could mean Dane is the Black Knight. Crossover implications!""Eternals"" held multiple scenes that were quite the thrill-fest, to say nothing of the memorable emotional elements they added to the Marvel-ian mix. Its finale was stellar and its pre- and post-credits scenes were ripe with possibilities. Here's hoping they stop dwelling on the 'non-interference' thread."
840,1,"Earth's whiniest heroes unite! A truly terrible movie through and through. Boring, bland and utterly uninteresting story and ""heroes"" who spend so much time in the movie crying you think you are watching some kind of a period drama. There is probably a scene of each of these Eternals doing some crying in the movie and for some more than once. The acting is terrible and the scenes that are supposed to be dramatic like one scene where one character is seen crying in the ruins of Hiroshima are completely laughable. Each of the superheroes are completely forgettable and it seems like they paid some of them only for a couple days work the way they keep disappearing and appearing in the story."
841,4,Don't know what to say -_- Pretty confused what was going on ?Didn't expect this from Chloe Xiao!The actings except 2 or 3 actors were trash specially Angelina jolie so many of us thought the presence Angelina jolie is a good point for this movie but after 1 hour has passed you realize it is a disadvantage and a thumbs down to this movie Jolie looked like inexperienced actors in this movie. But you know despite the fact that Kit Harrington had a little screen time his acting was good and real.Looking forward to see more of Eternals but not like this one.
842,2,"The feeling you get when you watch this movie Usually you feel something when you watch a movie. Whether it's making fun of something, getting angry, or just being amazed at what you can conjure up on the screen, none of that applies to this film."
843,2,"Unexciting, repetitive, underwhelming & easily forgettable! You have been bored with such an unexciting storyline, indistinguishable emotions, similar superheroes, akin villains, and above all, almost identical climaxes. You might probably appreciate the efforts to fill up a bald, uneventful plotline with Asian comedic elements, but you have witnessed that as well in some form or the other on-screen. It's nothing new, nothing touchy! The box office is such a gaslight, do not heed."
844,1,"Eternals will return ? Please don't. This movie is the outcome when makers try to act oversmart. It truly deserves the title "" Worst Marvel movie of 2021"". Jokes which were not funny , eternals not even being living beings, too many things which ruined the movie for me. What happened to Marvel giving a satisfying climax to their movies ?Not a proper ending. They were more concerned about making a second part rather than finishing the first one properly."
845,6,"Chloe Zhao's grandiose vision let down by lackluster storytelling Eternals was a movie that never got me excited prior to its release. The trailer didn't do it for me when it first came out, so I didn't care so much as to go check it out in the theatre as I usually do with any other Superhero movie. But now that the movie is available on streaming, I decided to give it a shot.Eternals was a painfully long movie to sit through. It is almsot 150 minutes of a story that progresses without any noteable development to get us invested in what's happening. I truly appreciate the scope of director Chloe Zhao's vision and the way in which she attempted to translate it on screen, but the execution of it through a very disorienting storytelling format makes all of that appear very shallow. There are too many characters to care about and none of them give us any particular reason to except for that they are the main characters. The threats they face don't seem very threatening and the movie despite its world-ending stakes never feels serious.Eternals. While not a good movie, is not a bad one either. There is nothing too dumb about it as is with some of Marvel's worst entries (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, Captain Marvel, Shang Chi...), but it still wasn't interesting enough to keep the audience engaged. The visuals were breathtaking, but that's all it has going for it, which isn't enough to redeem Eternals from being a bore."
846,5,"hard to connect The Eternals are immortals created to eliminate the destructive Deviants. 7000 years ago, ten Eternals were sent to Earth. They were able to eliminate the last Deviant 500 years ago and have been waiting to go home ever since.This is a reach for the MCU franchise. I like the audacity but there are issues with the execution. I do like the style and the visual but I find the characters hard to connect with. They are god-like creatures trying to pass as humans. There is something compelling in that but the characters never fully find their human level. There is barrier to these characters that the film is unable to breach. In addition, Angelina Jolie is too distracting in this role. I like Gemma Chan but maybe she should play Thena. Sersi needs an ingenue with star power. In the end, this is a tougher premise to execute than most and the film struggles to give it a human scale."
847,6,"REVIEW IN PART So far I have watched half the movie. Then I got bored and decided to check out the cast members on, guess where? IMDb. I'm originally watching The Eternals for Angelina Jolie and Kit Harrington. When the Bollywood came on I had to check to make sure I was watching the correct movie, no way would this be in a Marvel movie. Stan Lee must be turning over in his grave.So, I will finish this movie and let you know what l really think. TTYL."
848,6,"I thought it was bad but I was wrong! Visuals like monsters, powers and structures are of course top-notch. Everything looks crisp! The story is a bit confusing at first and a bit annoying that it drags on but all it needs is patience. You also might get annoyed at this character named ""Sprite"" so watch out. I like the DC essence of this film. It's like a Marvel and DC movie combined. Ending and fight scenes will not disappoint. Thank you Marvel and the team!"
849,1,"not good Who is the target audience, this is like 4hours long and just not interesting. It has too much c.g.i. This has so much going on you just feel like turning off as plot is a mess."
850,3,I didn't know which side I was supporting It's a badly thought and even worse executed movie.Story line is confused and excruciatingly slow.It's not often that I find myself confused as to which side I should be supporting.Plain bad.
851,9,"Very surprised After not being to do more than 30 mins of the car crash that is Venom 2, wasn't holding up much hope for this, how surprised I was! Very enjoyable to watch, funny watching the youngest Eternal act the entire group of the screen, Sprite - take a bow! Looking forward to the follow up."
852,5,Waste of potential Wasted good cast.Wasted time.Wasted story.Sad to see this movie.Wanted to see betrer interaction between Richard and KitCan't even find enough words to complete this review.
853,4,"So much talent underused! I definitely had high expectations going into this with the director and the amazing cast (whom I enjoyed their acting on this film! ) and it being a Marvel film. There isn't one Marvel film that I've seen where afterwards I felt disappointed but this one I did. A lot. It felt like a very long movie rushing backstories from second person perspective and then the present day happenings. I always felt like I was missing an emotional connection to the characters, their backstory and why they were how they were present day. Then when I finally cared about a character they were killed! Gilgamesh was my favorite. I haven't read the comics but I understand if that's how the origin story goes but it was frustrating to have so many of the ""Eternals"" killed. Ikaris I finally started to like and was connecting with his romance to Sersei but that went nowhere. Ikaris could have been such a great redemption character but they just had him fly into the sun with zero emotional reaction from his ""family"". Why build a character so much and give him the most backstory just to kill him off with zero emotional payout? The CGI was also not very good. Obviously the monsters and special effects aren't real but good CGI at least temporarily helps you imagine it could be. With this movie it always felt fake and a bit cheap but very overdone? Thena was also a frustrating character that again with better character development and backstory maybe I would have liked more but her just watching her family get killed and not do anything but then later exact revenge seemed a bit too late. Where was that bad assedness earlier? Lastly the Deviants. There were some great moments that made you want to know more and then the storyline always went stale. It just was too much going on but left you feeling like a lot was missing. I don't know. I really wanted to like this and maybe if you've read the comic you can appreciate it more than I could but it was a huge let down for me on every level."
854,5,"Should Have Been So Much Better!!! While it's not terrible like the latest installment to the F&F franchise, it still should have been much better. With all the heavy hitting cast and the budget it should have been a lot better. Some of the plot was kind of wonky. It feels like it's trying to be too many things all at the same time. If I had to summarize, I would say it's trying too hard to mix X-Men, The Avengers, Dr. Strange and the first Thor movie all into one film. It's kind of jarring to watch and I feel it was 30 minutes too long. I don't mind different Marvel films but this one just fell flat for me. It's just not that memorable."
855,5,"Beautiful but lack the sense of tension The photography is beautiful, but the systematic exposition of patricide lacks both the process of discovering the truth and sufficient psychological choosing. Which makes the storytelling tastes bland."
856,1,Two and half hours of absolute nonsense. One of the most boring movies I've ever watched. I lost two and a half hours of my life watching this utter rubbish. The only good part is Harry Styles' cameo at the end.I don't ever want to sit through this boring nonsense again.
857,9,"Nice plot and new inclusive addition to Marvel The storyline is new and inclusive in all aspects. But due to the length of the storyline, I think it would have made a fantastic series rather than make it a single movie.Its good to see that there is a debate among the Eternals whether the mankind is worthy of saving, but some important scenes were deleted off which would have made it more interesting. Hopefully the judgement of Arishem in future movies may show this in detail."
858,6,"Biggest disappointment with some Black Knight tease I'm definitely a huge MCU fan but it says a lot about this movie that for me Kit Harington's Black Knight character was the most exiting part of the film (which was only a bit more than a cameo). The shots were beautiful and some characters was quite good but you couldn't even relate to any of them because there was no time for it. The whole stories ""high stakes"" was so weightless."
859,1,"An utter and complete disaster! Thank God this was a stream and not the cinema. No wonder Disney didn't even attempt to put it through ""premium"" first. Who would have paid for this? Once I almost puked. That's when I turned it off. This is what happens when Hollywood replaces talent and competence with other criteria. Keep it up guys, every industry has its downfalls, I don't see why Hollywood should make an exception."
860,5,Disaster Eternals was Marvel's one of the worst movie . The main problem of eternals is the unlogic stupid childish story. The whole theme of eternals is bad. I had big expectations for it. Fully boring and waste of time.
861,2,The worst marvel movie yet Very dissapointed. I was looking forward to another great marvel movie but this was a massive let down. I would give it 1⭐but gave it 2 just because of the acters. They did try hard.
862,5,"SO SLOW This movie felt like it was 7 hours long. A lot of quiet dialogue and scenes from the past made to develop a story over thousands of years, but really just became boring. Then, in the last half hour, it seemed everything happened so quickly there was no time to fully explain what was going on.I enjoyed the action scenes quite a lot, but this story does a poor job of fitting into the MCU, and doesn't really have a lot of opportunity for future development."
863,5,"Tried to watch it, twice, but fell a sleep everyrime!!! Selma hayek: trying to hard and does just not fit in the marvel universeAngelina jolie: thinks she was in a heavy drama, it is a marvel movie people not terms of undearmentEverybody was acting like they are playing in a shakespeare story and it is slow way to slow for a marvel movie.You want to watch something like the notebook in a supeehero setting, then this is the movie for you, otherwise just do not waste your time."
864,7,"Most Reviewers Missed the Point I don't think many reviewers ever grasped the backstory of the characters. So many comments here are about wooden or lifeless performances. They were expecting another colorful, eccentric ensemble like the Avengers.Either these viewers lacked an open mind /fresh palate, or the movie didn't do well enough to communicate and reinforce the nature of the Eternals.I never read the comics, but from what I understood, Eternals preceded humans and were almost akin to deities. I felt it very fitting that most acted in a somber matter, as if above human trifles. (Kumail's Eternal was sufficient to provide some comic relief.) I also loved their exploration into the value of human life itself. Nothing super profound, but still a decent dose of philosophy & ethics.Though both are somewhat about MCU deities, this is nothing like the Thor series. It's good to have some differentiation, and the occasional slow-burn is quite welcome in my opinion. I don't need humor around every corner to keep my attention, as much as I loved Ragnarok.Visuals and action sequences are more than adequate. Scenes involving Makkari and Thena were all satisfying and impactful.My advice to anyone reading this before watching the movie, is to just forget the Avengers for a second, and remember that the characters on screen aren't playing humans or super heroes. They are playing deities that have lived forever and seen the entire human history. It's in the darn title, ""Eternals."""
865,4,"Long and Boring 😴 This movie is really long and boring. I watched this entire film hoping the ending would offer a good payout but it didn't. It felt like it took 7,000 years to get to the point and the point was boredom.There is no story. Even the actors were bored. You can see it in their expressionless faces. I'm not sure why they had to show random scenes from the past 1,000,000 years. There was no point and there isn't much action. I'm glad I waited to watch this for free on Disney +. I might play it again when I'm having a hard time falling asleep."
866,5,"skippable It was just to long, I have watched all the marvel movie and at this point you have to bring something great for a movie over two hours. Just not worth it there are so many better marvel movies. Especially when you know nothing will happen to earth."
867,1,"The WORST and most BORING movie of the MCU Do yourself a favour and please skip this turkey. Seriously, it's not worth your valuable time. This is the most boring movie from Marvel ever. Nobody asked for these superheroes and their story. I was very excited about Eternals initially, but after wasting almost three hours of my life with this, I'm more than disappointed. Avoid it at all costs. You have been warned!"
868,1,GOD AWEFUL Talk about the weakest link in the line of MCU movies. So much was wrong with this movie. From Boss to the damn plot line. Giant robot rocks making the universe. Eye. Freaking. Roll.
869,5,"Eternally regretful..... You know when something sounds too good to be true and it usually is? Well, this is that. There wasn't just one Moment that went all wrong. It was a culmination of many things. It started decent but about half way through you realize that we aren't any closer to seeing where the plot is going than we were an hour before. I'm not going to beat a dead horse about the run time but seriously it's too long. There are too many words and yet not enough at the same time. I think I'll just wipe this one from existence. Most of these actors are too good to be tainted by this film. I seriously feel the worst for the Chloe Zhao. She fell for the Oscar curse. I hope she can survive this."
870,2,This hurt my brain. Good lord this hurt my brain. This hurt my brain so much. It is such horrible writing. Please help me. Who can write a movie this horribly? Good lord.
871,8,Good addition to marvel universe Long movie as usual these days for marvel and DC. Tried a very justice league approach to make this movie story. Had a lot of DC movie feel to it. DC reference in marvel movie was surprising. Covered all kinds of race gender equality topics in the movie without to much diversion from the movie. Fun watch with brothers family in Disney plus watch party. The celestials had a feel of sentinels from X-Men cartoons. Good watch overall. Kept us interested to finish the movie.
872,2,"Marvel-less Sorry, but just another sci-fi soapie. 155 minutes of emotionally driven characters who after 7,000 years of existence, still act like 20-somethings.Lots of CGI action, and a very slick production can't provide anything of substance. Characters are cliched super-heroes with nothing new to offer. Basically a marvel-less marvel movie."
873,6,"I Wanted to Love It.... I really wanted to love it. The cast itself, is amazing. The storyline? Wonderful. But it felt as if it dragged in certain spots for character development and then launched itself quickly ahead... This could have been beautifully done in a short series. Giving it time to understand each character and their past on Earth more. All while giving time for a plot to play out a bit more.The characters were very interesting, and really enjoyed it. Just felt.. it played out poorly."
874,5,"Not sure what to think This movie was ok but lacking in many ways. I found it confusing to keep track of who was who and what was going on.The characters had so much potential to be something but the acting/script had them all quiet, dull, & emotionless, while just existing. I felt no connection to any of them except annoyed that Angelina's character even existed, the character and actor were a waste of screen time.I'm left with disappointment and have no excitement to find out what comes next or even who ""he"" is. This movie doesn't compare to the other Marvel movies."
875,2,"A bad trip. Too bad. This movie looks like a miniseries of 10 episodes shown at once.With the exception of Angelina Jolie, the rest looks out of place.The movie is so bad, confusing and boring, that it's hard to give an objective review.First of all: the plot doesn't make any sense. To achieve the goals the ""ultimate creature"" would not need any of the characters. The Eternals are kind of creatures that live badly here on Earth for hundreds of years without even having anything to do.And by the way, what do the Starks and the dragons do in this movie?"
876,1,"How could anyone rate this movie a 10??? This was the most disappointed I have ever been with a movie in my entire life. This movie was absolute gutterball, in fact it was a gutterball while using bumpers. With that budget, the Marvel prestige and that cast you could have created something so much better. Theresa Caputo and John Edwards recently said Stan Lee is devastated and hopes people can just pretend like Eternals never happened."
877,5,"Where do I begin? Like the header above, Where do I begin? Running over two hours, I was expecting the story to hit all the essential points. Sadly, the plot got lost in time, making me empathetically connecting the dots in between. The main story wasn't compelling, leaving me distracted by the subplots. There were potential subplots but sadly they were not expanded. Perhaps the budding romance between Druig and Makkari should be given a go instead of focusing on a jaded romance that died centuries ago between Ikaris and Sersi. Perhaps. Or even Kro... He could have an engaging storyline, the whole inner battle between good and evil as he evolved. The dialogues were underwhelming and simple for the Eternals beings. If they are beings of superiority, shouldn't they be speaking in an ethereal manner to depict such status? The narration and the intertwining of plots seemed to be choppy, lack of fluidity. The verdict? I was left baffled. I didn't want more. The question left to ponder. How do you salvage the sequel? Perhaps riding on Harry Styles' Eros?"
878,4,"Mediocre at best We may have been spoiled by previous Marvel films but this one isnt a great one. Its not bad but theres just something about it that makes it feel disapointing.The plot was uninspiring, the acting by most of the cast was indifferent and I expected more from the likes of Angelina Jolie but it was just ordinary. Gemma Chan was not a good pick for the lead as her acting style seems, to me, to be one dimensional and empty. They needed someone with more presence and more character.As for the post credit scene, I wont spoil it but the ""actor"" (I use that word loosely) they chose, jeez, scrape that barrel Marvel. That film will get a instant one star from me."
879,7,"Not so bad not so good Overall its not a bad movie in anyway esp if you have never even read the comics. But its far from the best no doubt. The score and the visuals on display were great as was majority of the fightscenes. It heavily suffers from the lack of a solid lead character but the supporting cast does their job to cover it the best they can. A decent setup for the future and a commendable introduction of the Celestials, Deviants and the Eternals to the MCU.Far from the worst the MCU has to offer but not top10 material either. A little more color, soul and respect for its source could've really helped the movie stand out.RATING: 6.5/10 (obviously deducting points for not honoring the creation and vision of Jack Kirby)"
880,1,"Worst garbage I've ever seen Love Marvel movies, hated this one. Did a 5 year old write this script? Total disconnect from beginning to end. Completely failed to grab your attention. Most boring unconnected movie I've seen in a long time."
881,2,"Dark, Drab, and Uninspiring I wanted more from this movie but it was so disappointing. The A list actors look detached, the plot was basic, the acting was just ok. The movie dragged on and on. I'm not looking forward to the sequel, but I'll watch cause I need to keep up with all the Marvel movies. I feel beholdened!"
882,3,Poor execution Could not believe marvel made this movie without any substance in the story and screenplay. Characters have not made any connection with the audience. Who is leading and why it is happening? It's a very long answer... such a huge cast brings nothing to story. Poor developed.
883,1,Two plus hours of a bunch of family drama! 5000 plus years of life on earth and every scene for the dumb internals is still a surprise.. ohh deviants can recover? Ooh you can turn that into a tree..? Ooh you can do this? Ohh you can do that? You lied? You killed?Crux of the movie as I see it is : Ooh We are arhime's lifeless robots so let's gain a conscience now after 5000 years and go against our manufacturer arhime..! Lol.. senseless storyline!
884,7,Wanted to like it It was visually cool with a great cast however the story was to heavy and somber for my 11 year old to enjoy. Comics even in movies should be entertaining for the whole family. Too childish for grow-up and too serious for kids. Sorry missed opportunity.
885,1,"terrible ~ cliché pie Film industry think consumers are also their product. Bad business for humanity when resources are wasted in entertainment like this that will dumb people down..i would rather kill someone and be in jail for 30 years if this was the only thing our times were able to create.You are safe, you are loved, like goose who become Foie gras.Watch a documentary instead. Read a book. Take a walk. Or simply stare at your hand... worth more."
886,8,"Dont get the hate! This movie wasnt pefect but it wasnt horrible. Since 90% of the audience arent neckbeards and die hard fans, it's the perfect way into Marvel....I really dont get the hate."
887,8,"Way better than expected I decided not to go to the theaters to watch this movie because of the negative reviews but after streaming it on Disney, I really regret it. I really don't understand why many people didn't like it. I thought it was beautifully made. The story was decent and the visuals were amazing! This is definitely not at the bottom of the MCU movie rankings. I would put it mid tier."
888,10,"A film for few Dude, the movie is very good and it's sensational, it's a shame that people meant the ""children"", they think it's a bad movie since they prefer punching and bombing every 5 seconds and jokes all the time."
889,2,"Boring! The characters have nothing with which we can make a connection. It's all plot exposition and tearful goodbyes that bored the pants of those of us watching. The bad guys don't have motivation beyond being bad guys. To be fair, we didn't even finish the movie. Enough time was wasted on it already."
890,6,"Too many characters - The movie is mainly about meeting new characters. And then you forget the old ones. This is tedious and boring.Wow we fight monsters, great...No disrespect to the actor - but surely a created synthetic super-being would be able to talk.... Right?"
891,10,ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! The introduction of the Celestials into the MCU really creates endless possibilities! I felt like the story was just right. I would have enjoyed a longer film though.Overall I thought this was excellent and I a can't wait for the next movie.
892,5,"Special Effects Cannot Substitute for Writing And the writing was bad.The acting wasn't great overall. A couple of good performances, and a bunch of people going through the motions.In the end, I didn't care about any of these people."
893,1,"Awful nonsense This is what Hollywood has come to.Clichéd, average acting, average effects, obviously fake fights, and a central tenet that is Matrix-level stupid in a movie no where near as good as the Matrix.Avoid."
894,8,Why all the negative reviews?? I don't understand all the negative reviews? I really enjoyed it. I've seen all the marvel movies and I agree it is different but I really enjoyed it. I'd definitely watch a sequel.
895,1,"Even my 11 year old hated it My son has grown up with the Marvel franchise and we have loved every movie to date, even the old hulk movies were loveable in a way, but this is utter garbage so much so that when it finally ended and god did it take its time to end, the text on the screen read ""the Eternals will return"" and the first words out of my kids mouth were ""please don't that was awful"". I chuckled along and said ""oh you didn't like it"" having previously watched it in cinema myself and he responded ""that's the worst movie I've ever seen"" and trust me this kid has watched some terrible movies.The non existent villains, the terrible acting, cartoonish CGI especially the mid credit scene, nonsensical story line, killing off the only likeable characters, the ""butler"" with his awful jokes and I could go on.I have never watched a marvel movie and thought to myself ""when is this going to end"" until I watched this dross. I don't have high hopes for this phase of marvel movies as both this and Shang-Chi are nothing short of woeful. Gone are the days of charismatic actors and engaging characters only to be replaced with tokenism and pandering.It was bound to end sometime but I wouldn't have predicted the fall would be so spectacularly bad.RIP Marvel."
896,1,"Eternals...forever boring The movie starts off at a snails pace and eventually gets to the speed of a turtle. The acting is poor, storyline was lame, and the length of the film makes it feel it was eternal. Such a boring and bad movie!"
897,1,"Horrible lighting! Who made the choice to put the principal lighting opposite the camera, everything is cast in shadow, horrible cinematography makes the movie almost unwatchable because you have to boost all your settings just to catch a basic facial expression. Boo!"
898,5,An empty peanut Scenery and costumes were lovely. That's about it. Minimum character development with a Ho hum plot. Did not work for me as a movie. Marvel should have done this a a series. That would have allowed the viewer to meet the Eternals. It would have allowed for better exposition on the story background and for world building. Often the Marvel stories are the most interesting when they are not set in modern earth. Thor two was best when the scenes were in Asgard or other worlds. And what was with the Valium version of Thena? With the exception of Gilgamesh the characters were the Snoreternals. Dane Whitman who has five minutes in the film definitely seemed to have a spark of life. Give him a series. Not sure I'm up for a second Eternals.
899,1,"Worst MCU movid...also the worst movie I've seen in the past 5-10 yeard The Eternals starts with a synopsis of why the Eternals are on Earth, what they are fighting, and who will end up betraying them.Almost the entire first hour is a serious of flashbacks. The characters themselves seem generic, and there are far too many to feel any actual connections to any of them, or to the team itself.Coming in at 3 hours, it's entirely unwatchable. I can't believe there is a sequel in the works.I'm so glad I did pay to see this in theaters, because I hate asking for my money back."
900,1,"Disney takes itself way too serious 2.5 hours is way too long for this lackluster of a script. I could go on for so long with items wrong with this movie but if you want to hear it deep and serious which Disney is what trying to do, then let me clearly state it...... it's a very ungodly movie from a spiritual point of view as well as morals and ethics. If you can't see this brainwashing and you find this just simple entertainment then you're the type of sheep that Disney loves. I will just stick with movies that just play simple fantasy fun super hero and not this intentional offense to my Christianity."
901,7,"A lot of potential, maybe better over 3 films? First thing I noticed in this film is the large amount of CGI. It's a bit off putting. The second thing I notice is how all of the Eternals are absolutely beautiful and it makes me feel like a toad. (Side note, I loved their costumes) With such a strong cast, I felt like Selma Hayek and Angelia Jolie were both wasted in this film. I did however enjoy Kumail Nanjiani's comic relief.Overall I liked the storyline, and the ethical/philosophical questions it poses are interesting, but I feel like the plot of this film could have been split into 3 films and not crammed into one.Sadly this movie hasn't done well either critically or at the box office so future sequels are up in the air. If there's no sequel, I would like to see the Eternals brought into the proper Marvel universe in the future though if possible."
902,10,"Amazing film I don't know why this movie got such mixed reviews. It's action packed, the visuals are simply incredible and I did not expect the twist at all. I Loved the characters and the storyline. I am ready for part 2!"
903,2,"So much garbage This is a compilation of bad acting, poor writing, and overall dribble. I found myself rooting for the bad guys hoping that humanity would be destroyed."
904,5,"Flawed and boring They are 7000 year old, but act like 30 year old people. They've learnt so few and still sound so fresh... One of them even had the great idea to have a family for the first time in 6970 years.People who lived 7000 years, yet are less experienced than me and you. A premise so stupid...But if you can cope with this major flaw, join Superman (blue guy), Flash (red girl), Iron Man (tech guy and hand laser guy), Hulk (punching guy), Thor (Angelina Jolie), Wanda (witch girl, mind control guy and illusionist girl) in another adventure to save the Earth."
905,2,"Disappointing Gemma carried the most of the cast, along with Barry, Don, Kumail, Lauren and Lia. Bigger names must be disappointed to be associated with this film as well as their performance. The story progresses so slowly you get bored and tired not even half way through. The hype wasn't worth it. I can't even express how excited we were to watch the film, we're lost for words."
906,8,"Finally, a Different MCU Film. Thank you Chloe. Eternals is a fantastic MCU film. The premise could have easily led to a disappointing output (knock knock GOTG2) but Chloe Zhao MADE IT WORK! The methods in which the characters were introduced, how their conflicts and differences in ideologies were displayed, the storyline overall, were elaborated in a very natural way, nothing was forced. This paves the way for the audience to really invest in the storyline and the characters as each was given the chance to stand out. The film was also visually striking. The cinematography was spot on and the battles scenes were both gorgeous to look at and fun and exciting, as expected from an MCU film. Overall, it's heaven sent to have Chloe Zhao join the MCU universe. The Eternals is something different which is absolutely a welcome sight. To the naysayers, I feel sorry for you."
907,2,"A didgeridon't do that. The tagline says: ""In the beginning ...,"" conveniently omitting: ""... what follows is awful."" This movie is profoundly silly: bad acting, bad dialogue, bad premise, and, in the name of Coco Chanel, bad outfits-seriously, what's with all the protracted posing and ridiculous pantomime posturing? This was the sweaty cheese spread over a limp, brown lettuce sandwich equivalent of an untreated fungal eye infection. Given that this movie was actually attempting dignity and seriousness, even if the viewer could suspend disbelief concerning the preposterous concept, it was impossible not to laugh at the absurdity onscreen. Since the movie was so fantastically foolish, here's a super-mixed metaphor review: This was as slap happy as a clam, milking a dead horse isn't rocket surgery, as this movie was alone in the noisy hive of cinema with no place to roost, taking a flying stroll, marching to its own trumpet with ham-fisted feet salami-slicing by the bean counters where the shoe was up the creek without a didgeridoo."
908,9,"For the metaphysical mind. I really liked it! This is all a puppet show or a movie and each of of have a starring role in our own feature! There are angels and guardians to protect us and we are all here to live and let live. This movie is a creative way at looking at way the angels, guardians, celestial beings do their jobs in order for the whole of consciousness and creation to fulfill the big picture.At least that's what I say while watching."
909,5,"This movie makes no sense linguisticly. Why are they speaking English thousands of years before the language was invented. Why do they use American Sign Language before it existed? Why do they have different regional accents for regions and languages that didn't exist yet. The flashbacks should be in an ancient language not English. I mean I know it's fiction, but how about some chronological continuity."
910,1,"Lame and tired I tolerated watching until half-way through.Lame. Dialogue written by a 10-year old ? What acting ? FX burnout.Is there a plot ? Who was your target audience, brain-dead morons ?Just another tired example of a continual downward spiral of mediocrity."
911,1,"Terrible Legitimately the worst movie marvel has put out. The characters themselves are pretty lame, the acting was even worse. Especially Kumail Nanjiani who might have been the worst casting decision in history. Honestly felt somewhat embarrassed for him.Skip this one."
912,5,"Below average. I'll give it a 5 out my love for MCU. But definitely one the worse movies out of all the franchise. Very boring in the beginning and the script was lacking. Too much forced comedy. Not all of the movies need to be funny all the time. Anyways, no need for a longwinded comment. Watch it for yourself."
913,1,Now we know why they roped in so many big names for the movie Absolutely thrid class movie. Zhao is supposed to be a visionary but i think she should stick to making indie films that nobody watches. What she did here is nothing short of a f##k to say the least. This movie reminds of the fantastic four movie and how awful it was. From the very beginning the eternals feels like a nothing but cashgrab by the studio. They had no plan for eternals in the past and now they had to explain it away in the most comical ( excuse the pun) way here. Zhao was successful in making a snoozefest of a movie here.
914,5,"Aweful There really isnt much to say about this one. Poor pacing, and acting, uninteresting characters. Lacks the charisma and energy of Marvel movies.Just goes to show, even Marvel can get it wrong."
915,10,"Absolutely brilliant film Loved it loved it loved it!Anyone giving. Negative review on this film needs to ask what is wrong in their life, film is awesome enjoyed every minute of it, praying theres a sequel 👍👍👍"
916,8,I don't get the hate It takes some big swings and I appreciate it for that. I enjoyed the performances. The CGI is still not perfect but it is a story I hadn't been told before. It wasn't formulaic and predictable. Sure I don't think it was perfect or without fault but it was a good comic book movie of a grand scale. I enjoy it.
917,2,Icky The only thing good about this film is it's not eternal. Over 2.5 hours of sharknado meets 1960's Godzilla. If that's what you like this film is for you. Otherwise save the 2.5 hours on something more productive like measuring grass blades.
918,4,"Short review To keep it short and sweet; I was bored to tears. One of the worst films Marvel has made. Decent special effects but the plot is awful.I hope they don't make a sequel.Oh, and it's way too long!!! Why do these directors think a movie needs to be close to 3 hours long to be ""epic"" or something????"
919,2,"Most boring supers ever I can understand Marvel wanting to expand its universe; all you have to do is look at the dollars to understand it. But, the thing about superheroes, they have to be super beyond their powers. I didn't know anything about these characters and frankly after watching this movie I don't want to know anymore. I thought Justice league and Batman versus Superman were bad. But nothing has been as boring as this movie. It's cheesy and preachy with no interesting characters except Sprite and the Deviant. I think they may need to stop cause superhero overload can cause bad movie making decisions."
920,1,"Paint by the numbers. This is a paint by the numbers thrash. Way to long and has nothing to say.The movie dose not know what it is doing and is all over the place. It feels like every scene was written on location and nobody knew what they where doing.Full of bad clichés and the worst MCU movie as of this being written, January 2022."
921,4,"The Disney version of Justice League If you loved justice league, there's a lot of chances you'll love this Marvel copy.If you are like me, that will be another 2 hours of pain watching a massive mix of noise and Z movie unbelievable scenario."
922,2,"Hard to watch Way too long movies wich is all about inclusiveness and talking about feelings. Pace of it is somewhere around snail because everytime the movie is about to take off someone wants to share their feelings. Not very entertaining, 100% predictable and hard to watch unless it's viewed as a bedtime story."
923,2,Disappointing Like many people I was looking forward to this and it was very slow and boring and brought nothing new to get excited about and then they threw in Harry Styles ... WTF ... Don't waste your time.
924,2,"What a boring ass movie Poor choice in characters! Good ones on their own, but in this i wanted to just go to bed. Why would u choose these guys to play super hero's? YAWN bored outta my FU@$ing mind!!! Shame on Marvel. Sooo good and then ..... THIS."
925,4,"Just bad movie making and story telling A group of immortals with names of Gods are sent to Earth to fight deviants, but is there some other more sinister aspect of their mission? Well yes, yes there is.This movie isMostly talking with arbitrary action sequencesTells you rather than shows youDoesn't let plot points progress organically, but stops the story to tell you themHas superheroes without properly defined powers, and when they start talking about them, this is the one time they don't explain anythingJust a waste of time. It is now like Marvel can produce any old rubbish and people will go and see it."
926,1,worst movie ever No clear story..scenes like indian musicals..terrible..it was not good to lose more than 3 hours at the cinema for it..not worthing to go and see it..all the movies looks great in the trailer but this movie is horrible.
927,1,"Such a disappointment Boring. Did these people ever come out during the day? The dark screen made it hard to see what was going on. Some good acting, some horrible, namely Sprite. All in all a big disappointment."
928,1,Eternally robbed of a couple of hours Big budget and great CGI will not help this film. The story is quite good however the casting and directing is below par.There is something missing in this film that is down to the choice of director. The action scenes are not that great. Its like watching DR Who basically.
929,1,Avoid Literally one of the worst films I've ever seen. Turned it off with 1hour 5mins left. What utter drivel. This is almost parody. I'm embarrassed to be a Marvel fan with an adaptation such as this.
930,5,Let down by Trailer Written 58 minutes in.The trailer is really good. Sadly the film is below average.I titled this let down by trailer because I had really high expectations after viewing the trailer and the film fell short of it.......by a long way.
931,2,"Poor Absolutely the worst marvel film. Far too slow, poor dialogue, uninteresting characters. Long winded scenes barely move the plot forward. It's a bit like watching s Netflix series."
932,10,AMAZING MOVIE A vastly different entry into the MCU but one that took me for a ride. It's impressive and I had a blast. I don't know why this movie has so much hate.
933,3,"The Worst Marvel Movie - by far! Lacklustre cast/characters providing no depth or interest to sympathise with. Boring and predictable story with an unnecessary convoluted (and non-sensical) storyline jumping back and forth in time. Oh... and at least an hour too long as well. Probably the weakest Marvel movie by far, it's as simple as that."
934,3,Did Not Like This At All I watched this and did'nt think much of it at all. It looks impressive but theres nothing there .I found the characters to be quite annoying to be honest .For starters the so called Eternals have been protecting the earth for 7000 years right ? And yet they all speak english ? The english language was'nt even in existance 7000 years ago let alone a Scottish accent. Even the main being that created the eternals in the first place speaks english. This movie to me is an expensive made pile of crap.
935,8,Deserves more credit.... I didn't expected to like this film as much as I did. There were few issues like the lack of chemistry between Richard Madden and Gemma Chan. It was hard to believe and feel their history. No emotion whatsoever between them. It's not a great film but it is a good one. Definitely better then Captain Marvel and the first 2 Thors.
936,2,"A complete mess This is clearly a money making exercise for Marvel. Boring script, wooden acting & overall a discount version of the Avengers. Absolutely forgettable."
937,3,"Eternal boredom 2 hours and thirty minutes of bla bla bla, and please, please! Take us back to the days when monsters were made of rubber, or learn from Sony how to make proper CGI, because those deviants are so uninspired and unrealistic as a cheese bagel (the dog), seems like no one invested much thought in creating this waste of time, the producers probably said: Angie in it, people will come to watch it.. the hero can cut a super metallic flying armada with his laser eyes, but not a small deviant...oh yes."
938,2,"Make sure you are 110% focused and note the least tired First off, i LOVE Marvel and seen every Thing.This is the first time ive given af review like This.The plot is good, effects are Nice and there are a story of love, loyalty and ambition...But the actors dont Get in touch With their characters, they dont feel alive.The movie does so many flashbacks With weird timing that one looses track of the movies.Also the intro feels like a short story aka star wars 'we break for nobody' and Then the movie shoots off leaving the viewer With a feeling of what just happend.This movie Is a nightmare to Keep track of....My daughter loved it tough... She probably hate me now for falling asleep twice."
939,2,"So boring! This is a mind numbingly boring film. Usually enjoy Marvel films but this is a seriously poor offering! To be honest after putting up with 40 mins of it, I feel asleep!! 😴"
940,4,"Stark boys found a way keep Cersei Lannister on their side The story was alright, but the script was very weak at times. Cheesy lines can be found across the movie which leads to cringe. Literally I could not watch the movie, but I was drawn to the story. I had to keep the movie running on one monitor while I was working on the other. Not a terrible watch if you are splitting your attention between work and the movie."
941,1,"One Star I miss the old movies and the thrill that use to come when you were in the theater watching them. They use to be funny yet amazing to sit down and watch them for the first time. Now you wait to watch them because you don't want to spend any money paying for the tickets. You don't care if you see them or not.This movie was just terrible. Marvel has this way now a days of jumping right into story lines with out any context. It was to confusing and chaotic to be good. So many things were happening at the same time. The flash backs were so hard to follow.Right now I think marvel is trying to do and add so many things and new characters at once that it makes it hard to enjoy the movies. I am a big Marvel fan but I miss the old cast, the original six. Maybe I'm just not use to change but I'd rather have more of the old movies than new story line.So I rate this one star. They did a good job on Shang-Chi and the Ten Ring, but in my opinion they tried to do to much at one time. To many characters and confusing scenes. I hope to write a better review for the next movie."
942,3,"""there's a million better things to do with 2 hours 36 minutes"" The Eternals is a Marvel film created around the idea that humanity's destructive prowess is the prime reason for its advancement and greatness. This is a pretty depressing idea to base a superhero film on, and one I wish was never made. It had some positive aspects such as an incredibly diverse cast full of talent, that was mostly on display in this film; and the visual effects were superb however, both should be expected these days. The story was straightforward and all plot twists that occurred were predictable from the first 10 minutes into the film. The relationships between the characters at times made no sense, there was no development onscreen, resulting in relationships feeling forced and without chemistry. There was no believable moment that the Eternals could fail any task faced, so the lack of any stakes helped to ensure that this film was a bore fest! Avoid at all costs, there's a million better things to do with 2 hours 36 minutes, than watch this."
943,3,Very very bad 5000BC people wore t-shirts? Who did the costume on this show should never be in the movie business again. Also 600BC the 'Gods' speak with british accent? Also very bad acting which shows how bad of a director Chloe Zhao is. This movie is a huge waste of money and time.
944,3,Over blown tripe. I'm a massive Marvel fan but this is a film I skipped on through some of the scenes. I'm sorry but men kissing that was the final straw for me. I turned it off. Worst Marvel adaptation ever. Give it a miss.
945,1,Just terrible Terrible. Just terrible. Sooo slow. Weak storyline. Gratuitous sex scene (Disney+)... Lifeless characters. And I'm a huge Marvel fan. 2hrs and 37 mins of my life I'll never get back.
946,1,"If you can't sleep OMG........just OMG......the only reason I give 1 star is because of the special effects, those are amazing. Other than that, if you can't sleep watch this and trust me, you won't see the end. What a lot of blablabla....."
947,4,"Where the makers Ill or under Drugs?? or Drunken??? First of all, i only know the movie ( not the comics! ) .So far one thing is clearly present. From all Marvel Movies, this one was the WORST ever i saw.Fault was not by the Actors.. not by scenery.. the Fault was clearly by the Director / Editor.. .The cutting responsible Person should earn a Golden Strawberry.Reason.. We have here a kind of Basic story. In this way.. so far even Avangers Thanos thing was still much more "" on earth"" ground standing.Then Followed. The WORST Story Chain inside a Movie, i have ever seen. Its a non Stop Today. Somewhere in history past.. next back "" today "" and then again something in history.. . But not like "" memorys"" Nope, like they are direkt at the main Story. This way, its close to impossible to even really follow the Movie "" in what time are we now, where in the Actuall Story are we??"" ... . So, Audience is extreme fast, loosing track.Then too it, where even the loosing track is pushed deeper. Outside of some Action scenes, mostly the whole Movie is feeling like a extreme huge Valium Pill. That you clearly start to fight, to not falling asleep. So far is that thing catching.If the Story line whould had been done by a Propper chain! And the Time line whould had been maded straigt that all can really follow and not these Endless Jumps. -- The Movie had been extreme much better!But btw. Here now, MCU is themself placing dozens of Traps into itself. Because too much gets mixed, that the "" Story universe "" Falls apart. It dont works anymore! Because finally now, we have at least 3 Different things mixed. AND everything has its own "" Backround"" what dont works anymore, with the other. ( Thor / Asgard Universe Explenation dont works with Eternals.. Same way avengers.. with Guardians of the Galaxy... ) ."
948,10,"Please watch this movie again those who didnt like it Its very good MCU film. Things shown here are beautiful. It has great action scenes. It has a good message. So please dont read critics, Watch this movie again."
949,1,"This can't be Marvel! It's horrendous. Absolute rubbish and I thought Captain Marvel was bad, horrendous, surely this can't be a Marvel movie! All the characters have powers like other superheroes, it was so boring, very very disappointed."
950,4,"Not worth my time Lots of great actors and visuals, but terrible writing & direction. What a waste! The disappointing storyline was boring & the pace was so slow that I fell asleep at one point. Salma's role was a cameo & Angelina's was so pathetic - all the CGI couldn't hide the obvious problems. Yawn, sadly."
951,5,"Worth it? This was an average, reaching attempt for MCU. While there were beautiful visual effects, the story line and character development was weak. I expected something epic from Marvel with so many big names and a title called 'Eternals'. Instead, I was thoroughly disappointed. Was it worth the watch? I'm not sure."
952,3,Started out good then..... I was entertained for the first 40 minutes or so then it got slow and boring and confusing and then around an hour and a half the alphabet group came in so I turned it off. Won't watch ever again.
953,8,"Absolutely loved the effects and the story is okay I really really like how they went about the visual effects in this movie, the laser eyes, the speedster effects, the scenes showing the eyes of the celestrals. It was gorgeous to look at.The story was okay; I feel like they ultimately screwed the pooch on the deviant plotline to satisfy some predictable and booring love/revenge plotline.I enjoyed the watch... Did I say, the effects are gorgeous?"
954,8,"An average movie I dont know why so many people didnt like this movie. Those are the one's who like only ""maara-peeti"" in the name of super hero movies. This movie was different from the other ones , it has bit of more drama than usual n whynot they have to show every character's emotions in just 2hours and make them attach with us. Casting was good, acting was good , vfx were over the top. Less action but i enjoyed watching every fighting scene. Story was also good. So ya , an average movie but really like THE ETETNALS.........,...... .................. ........"
955,8,"Glad I didn't read the reviews! I really enjoyed this movie. Stellar cast (Angie was brilliant as usual) and the visuals fantastic. OK, there were plot holes but I couldn't care less. I especially liked the 67 minutes of imax footage which has made me want all movies to be made in that format!"
956,1,"Terrible I never thought I'd see a marvel movie as bad a captain marvel but boy did Disney prove me wrong. Appalling on so many levels this film is. Don't believe me, go ahead and watch it. I mean u will like it if ur a looney leftist but other than that, ur gunna be left so disappointed."
957,5,"Dissapointing The movie was pretty boring, it had many unrelevant scenes that could have been easily skipped. The characters are pretty boring and I don´t see much character development. Also the end is also a bit confusing."
958,9,"Characters Are So Awesome and unique I honestly kept thinking.. this isn't as bad people say it is.. yes, it's a marvel movie and it is 'supposed to be good.'(which is true) and infact, this movie gives out an amazing performance and AWESOME CGI! WORTH WATCHING!In my opinion, (yes u won't agree) it might MIGHT Be better than Shang chi........ Fk I'm getting alot of hate on this one.. I didn't take Shang chi to heart, yet eternals has better CGI, Shang chi (and blackwidow) have better fight scenes.Ending was sort of disappointing BUT At the same time... Just... Goosebumps.. Yes.. Feel like it's length was necessary and if u likes this movie give it an honest rating Also if u watched it in theatres.. it looks way better on Disney +"
959,3,"It's an ok film It's a one time watch film, characters felt misplaced with not much character development, felt off chemistry - like trying to fit in to social decorum of race/ sexuality and culture, it's good to see a film being inclusive but they should not force this onto script and that makes everything in this movie misplaced, come on! This was supposed to be a marvel comic world."
960,9,"Imaginative, different, and beautiful This is absolutely still a Marvel movie, but the structure and visuals mix together with an interesting cosmic plot to make for a solid movie. It still suffers from all of the new character Post-Endgame issues of trying to differentiate them from those who came before, but it mostly succeeds with the main cast."
961,1,"Bad attempt. For me this was as bad as Captain Marvel. The attempt was there to be a dark and good one, but it flawed big. And the comedy lines was also misplaced and overdone.The characters also seemed misplaced and did not show the best of them.And the story? I did not know the ancient gods was aliens...."
962,6,"Not good enough for a movie but best for being as a cliff hinger of a cinematic universe After watch eternals, it would give the MCU fans a lot of answer for previous movies but also left a lot of questions. As the movie described, some characters who know about cosmic power or universe like Dr. Strange or Thanos or Collector should know about Eternals. But they were never mentioned by them. And it also gave me question about Dr. Strange 2: Multiverse of Madness. Will the Eternals interference in this events? Because this coming events will effect the whole universe. So will we be able to see again Celestials also? In conclusion, even eternals is not good enough as a movie, MCU fans should watch it because the info from this movie can make the upcoming movies more EPIC!!"
963,2,"Terrible It had decent effects... and that's all the praise it deserves.Unless you're thrilled by anything ""inclusive"" youtube cat videos are more entertaining."
964,1,"Boring I fell asleep during this lifeless piece of trash. No character development, confusing storylines, it' s impossible to feel empathy for any character.The special effects are quantity over quality...and It seems like this whole production was set up with only on goal: initiating another branch of Marvel merchandising and spin offs.Not a single effort was made to put even a glimpse of originality in the scenario, i's no surprise I didn't make it to the end of this two and a half hours cinematic disaster. This garbage makes the Avengers universe seem like Shakespeare..."
965,1,"Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear I've been watching this film for exactly 1:30, so almost half way to the finish line -counting the seemingly endless reel- I absolutely loved Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings thinking it vibrant and completely and excitingly different than previous MCU films and had high hopes for Eternals.Unfortunately those hopes were short lived, as has been said previously, although the reveal mid-way through the film that they were all ""fancy robots"" solved the mystery of why the 'acting' was so off.In this post Iron Man/Captain America iteration one can only hope that MCU quickly resets itself and makes better movies going forward.A huge disappointment. 1/10."
966,3,WHY???? So bad I am a huge Marvel fan and when I heard the early reviews of how bad the Eternals was I still had high hopes. This has the worst acting I have seen in a movie in quite sometime. What's weird is that is has great actors but I cannot spot one standout performance. The visuals were great and that's the only reason it gets three stars. I know your going to watch it anyway because like me your going to watch every Marvel movie. But rate it as it should be so Marvels takes notice..
967,4,"one boring trip, I stopped after one hour And then magic happened, Eternals on Disney streaming. Another entry in the Marvel world. And have seen enough trailers I was ready for it, it looked great but......after one hour I turned this off. On part of the effects it all looked great but what the hell about the story and characters. It's all one boring mess. Nothing happens and when things happens I was thinking, okay, is this it? Fighting against CGI creatures. Not that I have a thing against CGI creatures but it was all lame.The beginning was okay with the history of the world but then it just became one boring love story and as one said, a lifeless flick.How much I tried, It won't stick for eternal in my mind.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5."
968,8,"Many thanks to diversification and the supporting role Karun The film is very diversified with great cultural and sexual diversity. The story made many messy twists and the cut was not so good. The best role was the Indian film producer Karun who is both a cute man and funny. I like the concept, however, and look forward to the sequel."
969,6,"Movie is better to be made as a series I didn't enjoyed watching this movie. The story is boring in the one-third of the movie. I think ETERNALS should be made as a series, such as Wanda Vision, The Falcon & Winter Soldier, Loki, and Hawkeye. Therefore a lot more journey of the Eternals can be explained in the series, and also explanation abou Deviants. Thousand of years of the Eternals' journey is too short if explained in duration 2 hours and 36 minutes."
970,4,"What a hodgepodge cast of charachters Whoever cast this project should be relived of duty never to cast another movie again.Selma Hayek and Angelina Jolie? Really?? Awful awful, who casts these two for anything, especially a superhero movie.Harry Styles, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Don Lee etc... Most all a really bad mix, no chemistry and 100% not believable in this type of movie.These movies should always be virtual unknowns and steer clear of the washed up has-beens' that dont fit or others who are simply not likable.Thats my biggest issue of this movie, the casting (including the acting) a real downer."
971,3,"The Zzzzternals A very slow movie. It just wasn't fun to watch. Most actors and actresses were sleep walking in this film.I felt like this was one big yawn fest. I will ""eternally"" regret watching this. Yeah. Even my dad jokes were better than this film."
972,4,"Reckless plan! The avengers (and individual avenger stand alone movies) set the bar so high that reaching it even with perfect planning (Script, casting etc.) is very hard for Marvel studios (Disney).This movie? Is far from that and actually begins from nowhere and ends up the same.Seem to me that Disney is spending that hard earned fame and respect of the previous franchise recklessly cheap. Really hope to see a change of direction along the way."
973,2,What is this supposed to be Marvel or Hallmark lovestory or action movie make up your mind marvel Yes we get it the human race is great Mmm A female director is just fine but like this the marvel enterprise is going belly up to bad I always liked the movies.
974,4,Nearly 3 hours of complete rubbish. I haven't been this disappointed since my dad said he'd quit drinking.I expected so much more from this movie. Even the cast looked bored.The Blip should have taken the lot of them.
975,8,"Eternals. It just a great film with a great visuality and good story lines, they want to tell a new theme of the marvel where these is a new one. But the mins are this film is too quick for the story, it needs like maybe 3 hours. And yeah this is a great movie."
976,3,Painful How did Marvel get this so wrong? It baffles me. Even the worst of the previous Marvel instalments weren't this bad. I encouraged my wife to watch this with me. I wouldn't be surprised if she files for divorce.
977,2,"What was that? The entire time I was rooting for the bad guy! So then the movie would end. However, the three characters, I loved are that of Makkari, Karun and Druig. Everything else about that was abysmal. It honestly looked like the people making it stayed up the night before finished their assignment and submitted it by 8am. So meh I don't want to give A for effort in fear that they will make another one."
978,2,"Why does it feel like a low grade production? This is Marvel universe and Disney spent a lot. But the movie was so poorly made. Direction is weak, editing is bad and acting - well doubt any of these actors achieves the status of marvel characters. Such a big let down."
979,1,No redeeming features Great and interesting cast. But. Dismal. Seeing some really good actors in silly costumes is somewhat amusing. At the same time; not so much. I would rather watch Catwoman again...
980,3,"Now I think the writers are lost in their own story Just gotta say now with thanos brother showing up at the end of the credits, the story of the marvel universe makes no sense.So did thanos try and stop the birth of all celestials, or was that just a bonus for him? In the end the writers have no real direction and have totally lost the entire direction they were heading.Plus im mad that they didnt even mention apocalypse/En Sabah Nur.That would have been nice. With all the back and forth of time/memories i would have imagine he of all marvel character would have been given some signs of credit. No instead they mention superman and literally say superman or should i call you clark kent?Wrong universe Disney."
981,2,"Bad, in a very boring way In this movie there are some of the most awkward writing solution I've ever seen in a movie.Really, you writers, who gave you this job? Your parents? I can't believe a corporation like Disney is not capable to find someone who actually knows how to write a screenplay.So 2 stars, one because is crap, and the other because I've already seen Venom&Carnage - the cringy friends, and it will not be fair to put them at the same level."
982,4,"A Joyless slog and a waste of talent. A marvel film which feels like the worst of the DC universe. I'm shocked at how completely tone deaf this film is.The diversity is to be applauded, but when everyone seems to spend most of the film staring into the middle distance and looking like they forgot what they walked into the room for it undermines any goodwill.It's such a huge shame that the story and pacing are so glacial as it wastes some excellent actors.I mean seriously, this makes Man of Steel look like Guardians of the Galaxy. It's that bad."
983,4,Flat act There are many bad points about this movie but the biggest reason to not even attempt to watch it is the acting. Literally felt like certain people were reading their lines directly from scripts and mimicking what the director had shown them what they wanted.
984,8,"A beautiful and warm hearted expansion of the MCU mythology To say this movie is beautiful is a bit of an understatement. The cinematography, the music and the performances are all gorgeous. Quite a few of the shots just are absolutely breath-taking.And the way the story unfolds like a flower, revealing a tender hearted humanity that is rare in these kinds of movies. It's a wonderful story of how these god like people are changes and transformed by the time they spend among humans. It's sensitive and heartfelt."
985,8,"Osm movie Osm vfx, figh villains demon bgm story over all best experience movie. I was amazed by this movie. I was slightly apprehensive about watching this film after seeing the critics reviews but I made my way to the cinema regardless!"
986,3,Slooòooow! Drawn to watch by the good cast but struggled to finish it. Think these actors were otally wasted. Far too much talk with splashes of action and tooing and froing at so many different locations We literally lost the purpose of the plot. Disappointed. Have seen better B movies.

988,8,"So many bad reviews and none of them give a logical reason To start off i thought the movie wasnt the best but it surely wasnt as bad as people giving a 1or a 2 or 3 rating out of 10.While the movie lacks tons of action like some other notable Marvel movies But this movie was designed to carry the story this way. Theirs many characters you're meeting for the first time all at once unlike The avengers where they each had seperate stories or Guardians of Galaxy who had a much smaller backstory/team members.The movie spans so much time periods that they do an awesome job of keeping it linear and relevant to the story. Now i knew nothing about the Eternals other then I knew their related to Thanos + a few comics involving StarFox & Sersi appearing in them. Many claim they had a hard time understanding the story + whats going on and Either they didnt pay attention & was distracted or on their phones while watching or they just simply have low intelligence Lol.At no moment during this movie can you get confused or unable to follow along cause its clearly laid out for you. Now you must understand the lack of Action & scenes to explain deeper into their backstories should be very understandable based on the amount of time & amount of characters to go through.They compensated it through simply speech, in the dialogue exchanges between the characters and their reactions can tell alot of the story for you without having to witness the scene unfold live.If they make a Part 2 movie you can bet their will be more backstory covered in it just as Marvel always does in any movie. They just cant fill in all details that span such huge n convoluted histories of the Eternals into 2 n half hours.Now onto the next complaint I see about how the actors/actresses had bad performances some complainers said and how they seemed not into it.Either these complainers didnt watch the movie or they still lack the intelligence to process what the movie is about. Their not Humans LOL of course they not gonna be all human like in emotion n reaction.The way these actors/actresses acted honestly did alright to show the divide between humans and Eternals as well as show their slow acclimation in their journey living among and relating to them.Not to mention if you had made it till the end of the movie you would understand already why the Eternals actors/actresses seem so devoid of humanity emotions hence their acting portrayal. Luckily this is not a spoiler since synopsis already tells you their not human anyway.Now many of the complainers probably doesnt want to admit it but some im sure potentially could be nitpicking reasons to hate it extremely and theirs abunch of reasons possibly just pick one? A Muslim character, a gay character, an indian, a chinese girl, the director is the first female for a Marvel project, the director is chinese too, I mean so many potential reasons considering how low the ratings have been.Lets be real anyone to say they gave a 1,2,3 rating for this movie is either just lying to themselves or they have ulterior reasons to hate it cause let me tell you a movie thats 1-3 rating would definitely be a D-lister movie shot on a camcorder with first time actors along with cgi that looks like a 5 year old made it on a free trial app lol. I can list many movies that fit that category and i could even film u one in my backyard of a Squirrel hunting for nuts and u would be rating it a 1-3 out of 10 lol."
989,1,"NOT Sci-Fi Not recommended for sci-fi genre.We feel like its more motivated by spiritual way than science fiction. Script is weak. Actually what was the story line? Cinematography and others are not so new after watching all superhero movies of Marvel.Strictly NOT recommended, if expecting like marvel's best superhero movies.At least you can travel through history timeline. Its sort of documentary. Hahaha."
990,1,"Eternally bad! What an epic pile of poo this is! Slow, boring and dumb. I can't think of one interesting or intelligent thing that was presented in this movie. WTF were they thinking?! The FEW bright spots were jokes from the Indian guys."
991,6,"Feels like it's from DC While not terrible, it just didn't seem to really spark anything amazing. It feels more like a DC flop than an MCU gem. I would seriously compare this to the pre-snydercut justice league."
992,3,"Agree - Dire With Marvels budget such a shame this a duffer movie.Story was poor, execution was poor. Maybe it was rushed out during the pandemic!I tried to stay with it, drifted off a little bit. Not recommended."
993,3,"Scraping the bottom of the Marvel barrel I heard negative reviews about this film, but figured it was just being overshadowed by No Way Home. Although some aren't as good as others, it's still MCU and great entertainment if anything... right? So I went in with an open mind.I wouldn't say this movie is dreadful, but there is something that feels missing; like baking a cake and forgetting to add sugar into the mixture.It just doesn't feel like the MCU movies we know and love. Despite its longer than average run time, the whole film felt rushed. It had the feels of a TV movie rather than a theatrical blockbuster. In fact, while watching, I thought it was a more a kin to a Dr Who Xmas special.Apart from a handful of mild references, this felt very segregated from the larger MCU.In the end I think this lackluster instalment is down to the characters being the z-listers of the Marvel back catalogue. Unless you're a die-hard Marvel fan, it's unlikley you'll be familiar with the Eternals and that leads to a simple thing, the general movie going public didn't care about these characters. Perhaps if they were better developed this might be different. Eternals may have been better as a TV series.If it's Marvel's intention to produce movies with their bottom of the barrel characters, perhaps it's time to call curtain on the MCU.Oh and... Harry Styles?! Seriously?!"
994,7,"It could be shorter The story itself is pretty flat!It starts immediately with a bang, and then continues in over 2 and a half hours with few ups and many lows. The Oscar-winning director demonstrates the technical qualities in the chosen style and skill in knowing how to manage an important cast, but she could have done it much shorter. Interesting from a social point of view, given the inclusion of various themes. I advise you to wait for the end of the credits.Rating 6.5."
995,9,Fav MCU movie Finally something worth watching after so so many popcorn movies with forced humor for like every 30sec. Seriously. This is spectacular. Director has done a serious job. Cinematography is next level stuff. Visual effects are the same. The drama in this movie is the thing that got me. This should deserve a sequel.
996,6,"Let down by the casting This is so close to being one of the best marvel movies but is seriously let down by the casting options. Apart from Gemma Chan and Lia Mchugh the cast is all wrong. It felt like square pegs in round holes. The story is fantastic. Special effects are amazing as always but it just felt awkward watching most of these actors trying to do something that they just wasn't able to do. Who's idea was it to have Harry Styles appear? No no no no no.Individually they are all decent actors, but they are just not right for this movie. Hopefully Eternals 2 will focus on a different set of heroes from another Galaxy (please no more boy band members)."
997,4,When special effects trumps acting and storyline I'll keep this quick so you absorb the movie faster than the arduous 2.5hrs I spent.I wanted to like it. I tried.Acting was wooden bordering on cardboard.Special effects were pretty good and that's all this movie had. And that didn't pull it out of the rubbish bin.It seemed like the writer got most of his/her ideas from their tweenage children.So much mindless mouth moving that masqueraded as meaningful educational dialogue.In the words of Kim Jun Il to his son Kim Jun Il 'I am disappoint'.The memory of this movie will disappear into oblivion with only a trail of poor feedback on our beloved IMDB website.
998,1,"Possibly the worst Marvel movie. This movie sucked. I mean really sucked. It sucked so bad, I was in tears at seeing one of my favorite created comic characters, not only miscasted but also lose their beautiful other worldly uniforms. Makkari lost not his gender but his awesome crimson helmet and visor and most importantly his role as wingman to Ikaris. The only satisfying cast was Ikaris and Sprite. Everyone else was horrible. Gilgamesh was supposed to be super powerful like Thor and Hercules level strength with more of a silent character. I'll stop here regarding the casting and wardrobe, but another thing I absolutely hated was the rock like look of the celestials. They were supposed to have been dressed as giant robotic alien high tech beings....so sad. The story was slow and written by what seemed like a bunch of idiots, just throwing out ideas, to see what would stick. The deviants were written as brainless monsters, when they were much more than that. They resembled the same monster aliens from the Tom Cruise movie live die repeat. Then the Gemma Chan emotionless diva gave no sexiness to the siren character Sersi, it was just a lame duck acting the same as when she played in the movie crazy rich asians. The same can be said of Jolie and Hayek. Too much movie time was given to Phastos' family...who cares! They could have also written out Kit Harrington's character as it basically went absolutely nowhere! This is honestly the worst and glad I waited to see it on Disney + instead of the theaters. Disney better start doing some better writing because they already destroyed Star Wars franchise and destroyed Hawkeye, Wandavision, and I can bet they are going destroy Moonknight and the vampire movie. A couple of marvel comic characters nobody really cares about."
999,3,"Waste of time, money, resources...everything Hard to believe it is a Marvel movie. More than 2 hrs 30 minutes in length, waste of a star cast, waste of money. Sometimes the screen just has actors showing emotions for close to a minute without any dialogue. Action is ok ok, but story is completely lackluster. The Marvel genre movies are still logical and believable, but this one looks like one of those Chinese movies with an overload of special effects without anything else of substance, oh it is directed by Chloe Zhao and the lead is a Chinese, so that's that. Nothing against the Chinese, Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee are loved for what they did, but this one is just ....Also, if you are watching with a kid, just be ready to skip forward for one sequence after the Babylon party, rest can be watched by kids , if they want to that is.."
1000,10,10/10 Best super hero movie ever.Acting 10/10 Writing 10/10 Directing 10/10 Casting 10/10 Ive never been this excited for the next phase of MCU. I can't see how Eternals got such poor reviews. I'm making this review to overshadow the hate. And I need 150 characters.
1001,10,"Engrossing mythos. I absolutely loved this. It's well-acted and beautifully shot. The CGI enhances the movie rather than takes away and it was a refreshing take on the well-worn superhero genre, and reference to the Gods of Olympus.I enjoyed the plot, the complexity and the dramatic scope of the story."
1002,3,"Rubbish This movie is a total waste of time, 2 and a half hours I will never get back. Some of the characters are total rip offs of other already well established characters like Superman, Flash, Jean Grey.The movie moves at such a slow pace that by the end of the film I didn't care if the heroes succeeded or not.The one positive was Barry Keoghan."
1003,6,"Lost potential..though not eternally It could have been a nice movie since it sets apart from other MCU offerings. All the attempts to deliver riveting action and one liners seemed half-hearted with the plot producing more questions than giving answers.The cast ensemble was great but they somehow gave unexciting performances, some were quite wasted to be frank. The villain department was underwhelming with not much to focus up, just creatures to be wasted. Now I know that I went in without any knowledge of the source material but thought the deviants would be some well defined characters and not just some apex predators who didn't evolve. And the end well it thoroughly confused as to how the combined power of eternals can stop a celestial whose capabilities are beyond anything what we have seen in MCU.Positives were the shots were good cast is great. Movie length mattered since not much happens. And please atleast leave the bollywood out or get that act better. If you want to make a cultural representation please make it to be appreciated and not joked upon.All in all this was a decent film and looking forward for a sequel though."
1004,5,"Bland Storyline The storyline was terrible. Too much happening in a 2.5 hour movie. The characters didn't make much of an impression either. Action sequences were still alright, but got bored after the first hour. Don't really see how they would fit in with the rest if the marvel crew."
1005,9,"Popcorn flick but finally not a formulaic marvel movie I'm glad I can see a MCU movie has director's soul these years,not be bound by the ""Universe"". Maybe some fans don't like it,it's a pity. Marvel style jokes is the biggst flaw of this movie."
1006,1,"Don't watch this show with your family I was watching the movie ""Eternals"" with my 13-year-old son, and little did I know about the sexuality, scenery in the movie, so sad we had to turn the TV off and quit watching, we didn't finish the movie, marvel movies used to be family friendly, but I guess not anymore. We didn't bother watching Marvels as a family anymore but we're so disappointed at Marvels."
1007,10,"Great movie, don't trust the reviews see it yourself As the heading says, watch it yourself and form your own opinions. Loved the acting and the story. Hope Disney gives this one a sequel - lot of threads which can be picked up."
1008,6,"It's a beast At just under 2 and half hours, this beast of a movie does seem a little slow and uninteresting at times. The monsters and other CGI effects were on par with other Marvel movies. I think that with better pacing, a couple of actors that looked like they wanted to be in the movie and a shorter runtime would have got a higher score. Don't forget the end credit scene at 2:25:43, the sequel can only go in One Direction. I would recommend it though."
1009,3,"Unnecessary movie The conflict/story is overly made up. It's not a great addition to MCU canon. As a matter of fact, MCU will be better without these characters. I have no feeling whatsoever toward all the characters. I watch this movie because there is John fckn Snow in it, yet he only has limited screen time. Ugliest MCU movie ever."
1010,1,Boooooring Do not waste your time on this. Your two and a half hours would be better spent mowing your lawn and powering a sixer. I'd love to give a full review but an hour and a minute in I walked. Love the Marvel franchise but yall can put this right in the bin.
1011,1,"Empty Movie The Avengers movies usually leave you empowered and with a sense of.... we'll something. Usually courage, duty, or the like. This movie had zero emotion. Even when something sad happened, you could care less, there was no connection to the characters. It's like everyone was trying so hard to make it emotional connected, but it was never achieved. It just felt... Empty. And you leave feeling empty."
1012,9,"Refreshing! Start out by saying if you're wanting this to be a ""normal"" Marvel movie it's not going to be. It has a very different feel to it but it's honestly VERY refreshing. Recently Marvel has found a system that works for them and has been making a lot of their movies fit that mold to sell well (and it does). This is not one of those movies.I agree with some of the comments saying some little storylines here and there kind of got dropped throughout the movie and some of the actors could've been utilized more.Also, some people are insinuating that this storyline of the Eternals was just randomly made up solely for this movie which is not true. The comics introduced them in '76.Overall, the movie has a much more serious feel but has some comic relief as well. The graphics and cinematography are beautiful. And it's a storyline that most people don't know about yet! Check it out for yourself."
1013,10,"Don't look up the ratings! Ratings are lying! It's a badass movie gone down for everyone's unreal and unending expectations. For a origin story, it's a damn good one. Thing is, not every movie has to have Avengers level cg or multiple spidermans come together to make audience happy. In a few years, same people who are putting it down, will look back at this movie saying it's an underrated gem. Trust me."
1014,10,"Underrated!! I'm so confused why people disliked this film so much?! It was incredible!! Unpopular opinion but it was better than Spider-Man for me, which was massively overrated. I don't know maybe it's just me but I thought it was 11/10."
1015,9,First Marvel Movie I found this movie to be very entertaining. I was really impressed with the sincerity of character and family aspect of it and of course -!the love affair. The costumes were great and the sets were beautiful and the overall special effects were fascinating. It's set now for another chapter with Harry Styles showing up'
1016,6,"A Nod To Current Times This movie feels like it might have not even happened if not for fan service. This movie is a cry to stay relevant and show hey we are adult stuff too and come on with the sex scene, Marvel hasnt needed it before they dont need it now. Pointless addtion. As usual with Marvel films the writing is never bad and the dialogue isnt bad because the have the budget so all marvel films are average at best aside from a handful out of the now like 25 films. However this movie has a few small plot holes which did suprise me. In the last year with tv shows and movies, marvel has gotten pretty lazy never remember catching stuff like that before. The deviants were super boring in design and plot not interesting at all. Having seen all marvel films to date, this falls in the bottom half."
1017,4,"Beautiful cinematography overdone plot This film is stuck between a rock and a hard place. How do you introduce so many new characters to Marvel and not make it seems like forever getting there? Maybe you shouldn't?Unfortunately, 1 hour 20 minutes into this, about the time I got that ""this should be wrapping up shortly"" feeling, to my horror I still had another 1 hour and 15+ minutes to go.I think this film would've been much better split into 2, with less characters introduced but more fleshed out. I feel this way because although the film was 2 hours 30 minutes+, I didn't even really get to meet 1/2 of them.The Kingo and Gilgamesh characters were one-note, and even the more detailed ones were missing major ""why should I care about these people"" backstory elements.Angelina Jolie's Thena ""is crazy because she saw bad stuff"". That's her entire arc.Again, too much to cram into one film, so why did they?The cinematography was excellent, the director Loves her ""magic hour"" stuff and it shows, but I also fault the director for leaving in a lot of ""extra"" when character development was sorely lacking, meaning the film felt too long and too short at the same time.Oh, and the weakest mid / post credit scenes in Marvel history. Am I supposed to care about these newbies?Oh Steve Rogers, we miss you!"
1018,10,"Underrate Everything y'all wanted Marvel Studios to do, They finally did all of it with #Eternals. Practical sets/on location, Don't be kid friendly for once, Cut down the jokes, An MCU movie to have a nice colour pallate, Stakes etcYet y'all spat in its face. I'll never forget that."
1019,8,Great sci-fi movie What I liked about Eternals was it didn't feel like a Marvel movie. It felt like a stand-alone sci-fi movie. It's nice to have something different for a change. Looking forward to the sequel.
1020,5,"Wasted Pomp, costumes, effects and big names are not enough.What the heck happened? Did everyone forget how to make a movie?Whatever the reason for the lapse, fix it or the MCU will not see another phase.Watching multiple Eternals fail to put down a single Deviant, one is sorely tempted to dial an Avenger to get the freaking job done.The screenplay is bland, the characters non-engaging and the scenes tiresome.I doubt even a JLeague-style re-edit would help this one.PS A note to screenwriters.I know it's all fantasy but no human body will survive being snatched out of harms way at blinding speed. Okay?"
1021,6,"The more you think about it, the worse it gets. The second the movie was over, I thought it had been great. I hadn't really used the time while watching to really understand the plot and critique the various aspects of the movie. So right off the bat, I knew a few things: The movie had absolutely stunning visuals (probably some of the best ever), it was an intriguing concept, it raises a very interesting philosophical idea (should you protect what you love if it blocks the creation of new life), and there were some very funny lines (thank you Kumail).But then when I rewatched parts of the movie and analyzed the plot, I realized how incredibly weak of a plot it had. The premise of the movie was incredibly fascinating, but somehow managed to fall short it every way imaginable. None of the characters felt fleshed out enough, Sersi has got to be one of the most boring protagonists in history, many aspects of the story feel hastily mashed together, it feels very clear that some of the actors weren't properly cast or underutilized, and there are so many simultaneous subplots going on that it's hard to keep track of what's actually happening.Yet the fact that everything listed in the second paragraph really didn't become clear to me until a rewatch means one of two things: one, this movie is enjoyable if you don't over-analyze it, or two, I wasn't paying attention the first time around."
1022,2,Terrible I don't stop watching many movies but this was such a disappointment. It could have been very good and thought provoking but just did nothing. It was two hours of garbage. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1023,7,"Fresh, Different I loved The Eternals. Not the best Mcu movie, i know. But not the worst one either.It felt fresh. It felt different. As if It's not a Marvel movie at all. That's why i loved it. Huge respect to Chole zhao.Makkari's fight against Ikaris will always be my favourite part of the movie.Solid 7/10 for me."
1024,6,"Pacing was off, a series would have fixed that... Wow this is probably the first time since series have become the norm that Kevin Fiege and Marvel missed the mark.Eternals needed to be a 7-10 episode series. The pacing of this movie hurts the story and tone due to the fact it moves a mile a minute. Watching the film and looking at your timer you feel every 20-30 mins could have been a full episode, and you'll notice it on first play through. There's just so much to explore and Eternals moves at a pace to great for its own good.Cinematography was A1 and arguably the best the MCU has seen to date. Additionally, the whole cast nailed their roles, even the shorter ""personal"" scenes (expanding on development moments in a series).Overall, Eternals is a spectacle to view but one with flaws. I truly believe the film needed a 6 hour run time treatment through a series. Doing so would have create a stronger emotional bond to the characters while adding weight to important scenes that was not there due to lack of development.Really hope we see more from the eternals going forward because as a long time reader they have boundless potential!"
1025,5,"Would've a been a better stand alone film This story really doesn't seem to mesh with the marvel time line. I enjoyed the characters and the story, just fitting into the entire marvel timeline is a stretch."
1026,1,Wtf I have insomnia and sleep about 3 hours per night. I fell asleep 3 times in the first 20 min. It's now my background sound when I want to fall asleep.10/10 for the boringness!
1027,2,"sorry marvel Beautiful photography.I do try and not say bad things.This film is so one dimensional. The printed comic is better. No cohesive plot, wanders all over the place. The character and character development is as flat as can possible be. There were to many 'important' characters. None of them were allowed to develope. The dialog lack imagination. Staging and action is as flat as the characters.The saving grace is the photography. It is beautifully done.Do not waste time or money on this."
1028,4,Swing and a miss and I'm not even sure what they were aiming for.. The movie is unnecessarily long.. the characters are under developed and boring.. the story (for want of a better term) is also under developed and boring.. some of the effects are quite beautiful so I'll give them that.. but all round.. nope.. not worth the effort.
1029,5,"Nothing happens. Really. Ultimately it's a movie where nothing happens. The good guys aren't good. The bad guys aren't totally bad. They're just playing their respective parts. Kunail Nanjani, Gemma Chan, and the actor that plays Maccari (forgot her name) are great. Everyone else is bland. The other actor that stands out is the character actor that plays Kuran.All in all, I'm glad I saw it. But, it's not worth watching twice."
1030,1,Unwatchable This movie was unwatchable for me. It's the first Marvel movie that I was unable to finish watching. There are many problems with Eternals starting with the slow pacing of the movie. Many scenes were too long and could have been edited out. It doesn't help that the screenplay is also weak. The audience is dazzlingly taking back and forth between past and present day. The visual effects are not always on point. It's surprising considering the massive budget. Not even an inclusive celebrity cast can help this production from staying afloat.
1031,1,"Lacking in story and something.... Lacking in story... And something... Can't quite put my finger on it.And of course miss seeing Stan Lee in the movies, but that's anothe thing.Maybe you'll like it, maybe not."
1032,6,"It's Below Average... What I will say is this : The Action/Fight Scenes are well Done & High Impacted. Very Good CGI. However the Rest of the Movie, can be a Overdrawn Out, Bore fest, to say it Mildly., especially in between Action Sequences, The Story is so Bloated, that it takes away from the Overall Enjoyment. You may or may not ENJOY it, for Me, it's a Watch one time & Move on to Newer & Better things. Cheers.."
1033,5,"Space gods to fill in mcu gap This movie was ok, some good action scenes.This was lacking real sense of danger and more filled in a back story as to how the celestials began. This also opens up more questions on them.Some of the externals powers seem lame and nerfed.The 2 lost credit scenes where the best parts of the movie. Artsy directors should not be used in the MCU it has done nothing for improving the MCU story line.Very long movie that could have been shortened."
1034,1,"Beyond boring This is the most boring bit of tripe I Ave ever witnessed. Plot was massively convoluted, acting was wooden, special effects were done on an iPhone.Don't waste your time."
1035,4,"Dull, Dire And Drawn Out! Hello From Here - This truly is the worst entry in the MCU to date. And that's really saying something when you think back to 2003 and Ang Lee's Hulk! I saw no fanfare or hype for this movie, it just seemed to appear. Now I understand why, this spectacle has no substance.The actors do give it gusto, putting in a serious dramatic effort giving a more theatrical performance. Sadly the storyline has nothing for them to do! There is so little excitement and the super powers so underwhelming that the watching experience is simply dull.Why on earth this offering would make a great new ""Phase"" in the MCU is completely beyond me?! The characters have so little that's special, the action so unimaginative, the film feels very disconnected from the Marvel universe and adds zero to what's come before."
1036,8,"The movie was actually really good I don't know what all the fuss is about. The movie was really good. Alot of culture and history. And alot to put in just 2 hours. It wasn't boring to us. It felt like a marvel movie. There were complaints about it being ""too long"" or it had ""slow parts"". I read there wasn't any emotion to the characters. To be honest. It was way better than expected and i wished we watched it in theaters. Its not the best MCU film. But it deserves way more credit than what they gave. We're excited for their return."
1037,4,"So dull and desperately in need of better editing/scriptwriting This movie was incredibly dull, filled with useless backstory that did not help us get invested in the characters at all.The accents were all over the place, which was moderately disconcerting. The little humour in the movie fell flat and felt forced.The character's powers were underwhelming, Leaving us with less Eternals, and more a b-list of superheroes.The acting was okay, but slow and methodical. The movie felt more like some indi-emo flick than something from the MCU. There was no zip, no real substance we expect from a Marvel film.This is probably the worst Marvel film ever, and I am counting Howard the Duck in that list."
1038,2,"It just feels like an unnecessary movie The whole plot was terrible . They focused all the attention for almost 2 hours on the deviance and all of a sudden it turns out they're not the bad guys after all let's focus 30 minutes of the rest of the movie on someone else.. Marvel failed a great cast with a terrible script. Marvel should separate Eternals film into 2 Parts to have more progressive storyline and deep dive on characterization and the build up of motivation to save the Earth with balanced action sequences and dramas in between... Eternals Book 1 and Eternals Book 2. Just like what Warner did on Dune film.. or Avengers 3 and 4. Worst movie I've seen in years!!!! Worst MCU movie. Hardly any character development, no reason to care about the characters. Outside if him, the comedy was lackluster. Pace was off. Most performances by the actors were good but their stories were not deep enough, hard to do with that many protagonists in one movie. My first thought was why do the people already have british and scottish accent even before they arrive on earth? Like it would make sense if they all spoke similar english when they first arrive on Earth but when they later end up separating and going their own ways they end up developing their british and scottish accent or whatever. Maybe I'm nitpicking it too much but it was literally the first scene in the movie that just broke my immersion immediately."
1039,1,Worst storyline and acting Worst super hero movie of all time next to Wonder Women 1984. It does not have a proper story line. It wanted to create something which is out of nowhere. They pulled actors from every continent for the marketing purpose only . Who is this Indian guy who really does not represent Indian culture at all and not even capable of getting a roll in Indian TV series. Casting just based on the super power of Salma Hayek and Angelina. Why this movie even exist?
1040,8,"Eternals... In ny opinion this movie had one of the best fight scene in marvel. This movie had a different touch and i liked it. Three things i didnt like was the ikaris and sersi doing it,ikaris killing himself and i didnt like that the movie was 2 hours and 39 mins."
1041,6,"Wasted potential... Eternals is the first MCU movie that I did not watch in cinemas. I usually do but the trailers just didn't sell me and the characters themselves I have no knowledge about it to care. Then the reviews came out and it was very negative. This was the final nail in the coffin for me. The premise is ""The Eternals, a race of immortal beings with superhuman powers who have secretly lived on Earth for thousands of years, reunite to battle the evil Deviants"". So are the reviews correct or is this movie actually better than the reception it was given?The most obvious praise is the visuals. MCU movies tend to be pretty dull looking for the most part. There are a few such as the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok where the visuals do have more impact. In Eternals, the visuals are gorgeous! A lot of the shots are incredibly vibrant and stunning. Even when it is just a shot of them standing around, it looks more picturesque than anything Marvel has done before. The CGI was also astonishingly good. The CGI of the Eternals power was great, the enemy Deviant design and CGI was great, plus the Celestials were amazing in scale and scope. Eternals also explores some interesting themes about humanity that I do like.There are also some really great action sequences in the film. The forest action sequence is memorable as it has a cool Superman-like fight scene. The final fight is also quite great too with how the abilities of the Eternals are utilised. Special praise to how they handle the Eternals, Markari, super speed power as they for once don't use slow-mo which makes it look more unique. I also think the actors do a great job. Kumail Nanjiani and Brian Tyree Henry are both a joy to watch when on-screen while getting some genuine laughs from me. Richard Madden is cool yet menacing. Lauren Ridloff despite being deaf, easily convey the right emotion for the scene. Barry Keoghan is creepy yet charming and Don Lee gives a real lovable performance.However, there was just something off about the main lead Gemma Chan who has the most screen time. Her performance was just very wooden and dull most of the time. She has been in the MCU before in Captain Marvel (2019) and I remember her standing out a lot. So it was just kind of odd how boring her performance was in here. Although, the major reason for this could be how her character, Sersi, is written. Every other Eternal has a clear personality, views, motives and problems. Sersi just seems to love humans and has some love problems that feel very inconsequential for the most part. She is a very boring main character with the other Eternals being way more interesting than her.On that note, this movie has too much going on. Each of the Eternals has its own problems that get brought up but immediately brushed over in a matter of seconds. For example, Phastos abandons humanity after seeing what they did with the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima, but the scene after he is completely over that! Every Eternal has an issue that could have been a whole plotline in itself that would've been more interesting than the actual plot. There is also a main deviant that starts to grow stronger, knowledgeable and more intelligent, which was a very intriguing idea. Unfortunately, the deviant is completely wasted and ends up having little to no impact on the main story whatsoever. Just there so the Eternals could have someone to punch. They could've removed this intelligent deviant and the story would still be the exact same. What a waste...Additionally, the pacing is quite bad. There is a lot of moments throughout where the movie just slows down considerably to the point that it can feel dull. This isn't helped by the fact that this movie feels like an eternity. It is 2 hours 30 minutes but it could be cut down by 15-20 minutes and still convey the same plot. There is also an incredible amount of exposition and it can almost feel like you are getting bombarded with way too much information. Character development is also rushed. Characters will go from feeling one way about something and completely do a 180 on it in a couple of minutes. It doesn't feel natural or believable. Furthermore, there are too many characters introduced and they don't get explored or enough screen time to really resonate with any of them.Overall, the reviews make Eternals out to be the worst MCU movie. I disagree with that as there are definitely way worst MCU movies than this. Nevertheless, it does feel like the movie crammed way too many ideas into it and did not utilize the ideas properly. Eternals (2021) could have been something amazing and unique in the MCU. Sadly the final product just ends up feeling like a complete waste of its potential. There is some genuinely great stuff in it but I do feel like the Eternals might be better suited to a Disney+ series than a movie."
1042,8,Eternals In my opinion this movie was good it was a different marvel film. In my opinion this movie had one of the best fight in all marvel movies. I would cut the s3x scene.
1043,7,"A bold attempt Zhao guide this is Gemma Chan, finally stop tia jose wake, hand in the ""theme park"" injected a new thing, a bold attempt of her (independent women are to the big IP, directed the race of humanities in fictional development), accustomed to the art of business thinking so to feel neither fish nor fowl and even can't accept it, But on the side, it proved its success. The tree moved the dead and moved the life. The transformation and change of commercial film need such people and time to test."
1044,1,"What a wasted opportunity By far the worst Marvel / Superhero movie ever. I can't express with words the terrible quality of the script, acting, special effects, etc. Eternals is so bad it would fit well as a featured film on Mystery Science Theater 3000. That might be the only thing that could make this movie tolerable."
1045,7,"An attention rollercoaster I don't get too technical on production or scenery.. I prefer to review the actual story content and attention span dynamics. The story line has content and reminds me of the mini series back in 2014.So nwith that, while watching this movie, I found myself on a roller coaster. It begins with a dramatic high point then as time goes on it faids into lack of interest and borderline boredom. The just when I find myself looking away and at the end of my attention span something happens that draws me back in until the whole process starts over again.The ending eludes to a second movie, if so, I hope they tighten the scenes and do a better job of keeping the boredom away."
1046,7,"Boring from minute 1 I've never seen so many fake reviews for a movie. Can't say it's all Angelina's fault, but it is quite a bit Angelina's fault. Kumail... I trusted you. You were the best part of this film and I still look forward to your future works. Hope this wasn't the death knell of MCU."
1047,5,"my opinion I don't like it at all... when i heard the name Eternals i thought it would be this movie that got people talking about it for weeks but i couldn't believe my ears when i heard the feedback that people Gave me , i was in shock i was like na na marvels isn't a let down. So i had to see it for my self and it turns out i was disappointed .... sigh ..am not gonna say its the worst movie because some part of it was okay."
1048,3,"Where's the director's cut? Even though this was a really long movie and gave it a score of 3 out of 10 the only way I'll pump this movie up two or three more points is if they remake this movie including deleted scenes, extended versions and reshoots just like the Rob Synder's Justice league from DC that originally premiered and sucked but the director's cut made it better. I expected a lot from this movie and casts and thanks to that they almost ruined the MCU for me."
1049,1,"2 hours and 37 minutes of my life that I will never get back For more than a decade, Marvel has provided audiences with visually exciting, rich, interwoven storytelling. Impressively, the MCU franchise produced a long and detailed story arc encompassing a myriad of superheroes and villains. Even more impressive, Marvel has recently spawned several wonderful TV series that tie into the MCU, introducing new characters and providing interconnecting storylines leading into the next MCU story arc.And then came Eternals.(big sigh)I still can't believe how truly bad it was.Let's start with the story.Was there a story?The original story came from comic book legend Jack Kirby. Kirby is perhaps best remembered as the original illustrator for Captain America, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, and many other comics, most notably Thor, wherein Kirby created the iconic appearance of Asgard.Kirby is a legend, and left an indelible mark on the comics industry.Based on Kirby's stature, during the 1970's both Marvel and DC let him not only illustrate, but also write his own stories, creating his own superheroes. For DC he created New Gods, Forever People and Mister Miracle. For Marvel, he created the very similar Eternals. All of these stories are ambitious, far-reaching tales spanning time and space.As an avid comic book reader of the 1960's and 70's, I was underwhelmed by both the DC and Marvel Kirby franchises. The 'heroes' all had names that were close or identical to those of heroes, gods and goddesses from historical mythology. The stories were half-baked, watered-down variations on the same historical mythology.But based on the previous 13 years of amazing and engaging work, I had high hopes for the MCU version.Sadly, the film was even less amazing and engaging than the 1970's comics.In Eternals, the audience is given a load of exposition up front. This is never a good sign for a modern film. It suggests that the audience is not bright enough to parse out what is going on without a written explanation, and/or the screenplay writers were too lazy to figure out how to tell the story in action on screen (which is after all their job).Apparently a Celestial (a super-godlike being predating the creation of the universe) name Arishem created heroes called Eternals to protect many worlds from baddies called Deviants. Confusingly, the Deviants were also created by Arishem. So what is Arishem playing at?Spoiler alert:That question -- the only one that seems to matter in the entire film -- never gets answered.The audience is dragged back and forth through time between the present and various chapters of ancient history. Within a scene or two, the heroes have become world-weary and disillusioned, with building tensions that threaten to break up the band.For a tale of galactic proportions spanning eternity, Eternals is visually underwhelming. The color palette is limited (mostly to earth tones and blue and gold, like the old school colors).The score, well, there was no score. The music was a patched-together amalgam of old rock music, starting with Pink Floyd's ""Time"" from ""Dark Side of the Moon."" This device was revelatory in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (and sequel appearances of the GOG), but somehow in Eternals came across as trite and disappointing.I feel sorry for the cast, who did their best. It was fan-pleasing to see Rob Stark and Jon Snow reunited. Sadly, that was the high point of the film for me.Overall, the production value felt more suited to a TV show than a feature film.No doubt there is a more coherent synopsis available elsewhere, but to be honest I am not quite sure what happened, because during the film, I literally fell asleep.Twice.How this tedious tale will be interwoven with the rest of the MCU's emerging multiverse remains to be seen. Hopefully, it will occupy some small, quiet corner of it."
1050,2,"Won't watch again This movie felt like 3 movies supercut into one. Pacing was all over the place. Seems a stretch for me to call most of these characters ""super-heroes,"" most seemed remarkably pathetic in their abilities, some of these ""Eternals"" were so easily killed, yet some inexplicably were tanks. Humor was very weak; the best lines were from the trailer and most of those were cringey. Kit Harrington was wasted. Angelina Jolie was wasted. All the major plot points were just exposition vomit or were so obviously telegraphed. I was never so conflicted in a post-credit scene. On one hand I was grateful for this dreadful movie to be over, and then sacked with absolute apathy that the Eternals ""will return...."" I hope not. I was just so so disappointed, wanted to cry this movie frustrates me sm, lore was thrown out the window, it didnt even seem like the eternals (besides the fast girl) could even fight. I was looking forward for this movie to demonstrate how this era of marvel movies is supposed to be on such a vast scale, no longer being about earth alone but the multiverses."
1051,1,"...or less. I came to this for three reasons; 1. Marvel 2. Angelina Jolie 3. Kumail Nanjiani .. .. All three were disappointing!The story was uninteresting and forced. I found the scene transition to be choppy. The characters were underdeveloped and those set for big climaxes were just underwhelming. In short, a waste of time. And the post credit scene failed to rouse my curiosity. Unfortunately, despite such a star cast, it fell flat.Looking forward to a better one, Marvel!"
1052,1,"Why Bother? Why even bother with such ridiculous explanations of past events with poor acting and very boring characters?They could have at least stick with it as an ancient tale without bringing it to the present time, it would have been more convincing."
1053,2,"Leaping over the shark into the stratosphere Sorry, I can accept characters with superpowers, even alien species. But after THAT.. how the hell am I supposed to take this franchise seriously ever again? There is a giant creature the size of the moon stuck halfway out of the planet? Then Harry Styles walks in... The plot was absolutely ridiculous and so BORING. It felt like it went on for 4 hours. There was about 50 characters, and I honesty did not like a single one. Endgame really should have been THE END."
1054,1,Terrible Definitely the most terrible marvel film I have watched. It was really bad and I really hope the future is better than this. Eternals? Superman would of wiped the floor with them. It was a poor movie and I'm very sad to have watched this.
1055,9,If you read you'll understand I think eternals is a great movie. For marvel that now opens the doors for the hero's in that fell from the sky. Others like spider man and those. Come on marvel is based in the galaxy and also earth. Each with different hero's but in the end come together to be one. If you know marvel read and watching the movies. Yes some of it isn't all correct. But again this is marvels introduction from marvels strongest hero's going separate ways from Endgame. Now opening doors that marvel universe can keep expanding for more characters and another Mad titan. It's a process yes we won't love all the movies but never ever forget. Those Movies gave us endgame that's only a phase marvel this phase is only the beginning. Who knows what other Hero's those that fell from the sky is next for us all.
1056,5,"Didn't feel like a marvel movie It was not paced right, the script was not witty or heart felt. When comedy was attempted it felt like the timing was off. This series has potential but something will need to be changed for the next one, new writers and director maybe?"
1057,2,"thats no The scenery was great, but the actors didnt gel well enough, it was like strangers first meeting each other with powers and the some of the acting was shocking.Then harry styles at the end! What a drop kick to the balls."
1058,6,"Had the Potential of Being Great This film is a perfect example of something that had all the potential in the world but came up short of its capability.The Good: First, I found the backstory to be super intriguing, and it really captured my imagination. Second, the visuals are superbly done, and the fighting sequences deliver big. Last, 2-3 of the actors deliver really good performances and had interesting stories.The Bad: First, the movie was too long. I felt like I was watching a gratuitous ""director's cut"" with a director that felt like every little boring scene just had to be included. This should have been 30 minutes shorter. Second, outside of 2-3 actors, the others were both poorly cast and delivered performances that annoyed me at times. Last, they followed way too many storylines. The movie loses focus and made me want to fast forward to get back to the main plot.I lay these issues at the Casting Crew, Director and Editor's feet. The Director should have made the actors do scenes properly and with higher quality acting. The editor should have cut WAY MORE out of the film. The Casters should have thought more about inter-character chemistry.6/10. Worth seeing if you're a Marvel fan, but may frustrate you like it did me."
1059,5,"Not the Marvel level Expected way more than this. Maybe we're spoiled by a very high bar Marvel have set for their movies.The following is for the character limit, please ignore: Okay okay I'll wait for you to come back in the park and park in north park and park in park."
1060,2,"Marvel is slowly dying with films like this! Please don't make a sequel and ignore this ever existed! First time review and the film was that bad I had to join and get my rating in! The effects are really good and the fight scenes are great but the story is terrible! Seriously, the characters are awful and every little joke is cringe and I mean every single one. This could easily be a spoof superhero movie.Marvel is slowly turning into Star Wars, more interested in making money than making great films! Scared for future Marvel releases. Please don't make a second one or at least get a decent director who can create something exciting and do a decent job at telling a story."
1061,4,"Meh... Marvel (Disney) are picking up bad habits from working with Sony. The original two Spiderman series were essentially love stories wrapped in a comic book superhero movie. Sony just didn't get it, until Marvel started doing their thing with spidey.And now Marvel have made the same mistake. Eternals is essentially a love story....boring.This whole movie feels completely set apart from the main MCU, not part of it. And no amount of references to the other MCU movies can change that. It all seemed very forced.Overall, the acting wasn't great. The dude who controls peoples minds was good. The actor who played Ikarus was good. Angelina Jolie was....well, she was Angelina Jolie. Always awesome, but that's coz I've had a crush on her since Hackers.Not my cup of tea."
1062,1,"Worst movie ever 2 hours and a half of my life wasted on this piece of bad writing, some editing glitch, the story could have been good but the script is terrible, couldn't symapthise with any of the characters as they are poorly built. No chemistry between lead actors (Serai and Ikarus).I give one star for the costumes although some of them were over exaggerating in the case of Angelina Jolie, like why??"
1063,4,"Pew, thought it would never end! Ok, I admit I am a bit starved for a fantasy masterpiece right now but as there is none I sat thru this instead.Marvel tried! They really tried... They really, really tried but Im sorry this is pure crap!Even twisting my mindset into a thirteen year old, I could not ramp this up to more than probably a 5.The acting is hollow, performed like in a coma. Was the director even at the set?The cast is also wierd, I guess I know what they are trying to achieve but it doesnt work.The story is stumbling upon itself and as this is a two and a half hour film, it feels like an endurance contest because you realize it will turn into nothing.The cgi..? Hmm well, its Marvel... One scene made me laugh though, and will probably be the only thing I will remember from this flic. It was when ""speedy girl"" was making a twister on the beach, churning up sand in the bad guys eyes! Almost a grain of humor there."
1064,3,"It's...ok. prob one of the weakest Marvel films Story and lore were ok and gave some depth to the marvel world. But otherwise the story was fairly flat.You didn't feel anything for any of the characters. There were no amusing parts or laughs to be had and some of the effects were not up to normal marvel standards.Also, stop putting Harry god damn styles in films, he can't act and no one is bothered. You are catering to the wrong demographic. I was actually annoyed when I saw him added. The film could have done with unknown actors instead of using people that we have seen in was other stuff.. It was a very digital effects film but it didn't sit right. The voice dubbing on the little goblin at the end for example. Just didn't match.Everyone looked a bit awkward in their roles.Also the sound track didn't for well, the songs chosen weren't right for the feel.Glad I didn't go to the cinema to see this.Also if you are gonna make a film IMAX do the whole film not just sections of it and the rest side screen... Why mess around.Worth watching if you are a marvel fan, otherwise you will be bored, become lost and lose interest."
1065,6,"Cool concept - poor execution The concept was brilliant, the visuals were impressive, but it was lacking something. I did enjoy this film, mostly because the concept was cool, but the script I felt was weak and whilst this is a lengthy enough film, there was little interaction between the characters, and they all felt under developed. Perhaps there were too many of them. There were some funny moments and great combat scenes as well, but it is missing some serious heart. I would actually imagine that now we have the concept down and some new characters to enjoy, the next film should be an improvement."
1066,1,So wrong What a shame but marvel since endgame have got it all wrong and they are undoing all the work they did I'm not going to invoke a backlash but this is a full PR film from start to finish with usual PR no plot.
1067,1,"Just Re watched Eternals It was somehow even worse then the first time, if you enjoyed this film, you have no idea what good writing is, or you're a paid writer for fake updoots."
1068,2,Awful Really poor. I joined IMDB after using it for 20 years just to share how poor this film is.Every time it builds to something there is some silly magical special effect to save-the-day #yawn.This is worse than the DC Justice League.The only thing that could possibly be worse is a part 2 with Garry Styles!!! (Even the teen generation say this)Please let this awful Marvel branch die now quietly... and for any prospective viewers - basically do anything else and you will bee we better off.
1069,5,Worst MCU If your a true marvel fan this can keep you entertained to last to the end but tbf it would have been much better as a series because you can't get to know the characters so you don't really end up liking any. The 'funny character' wasn't very funny and it was slightly cringe how they tried to make a humerus script.The acting was really bad. It didn't feel like a MCU movie at all. The fighting was awful and didn't really get you excited like other MCU movies do.To top the confusion off in the end credits Frodo and one direction turn up and that's when I just lost my mind.Ruined. Shameful. The end.
1070,3,"Mindless garbage - the moral-virtue-signaling kind No extra points for effort here as they are trying way to hard to please as many as possible... with the result that this film falls flat on its face... Bad plot, bad script, bad acting, and endless virtue-signalling instead of focusing on the story...The film is also way too long considering it's lack of capturing any significant interest... The only positive thing is a few scenes with decent CGi.... but even this gets old pretty quickly as the fore-mentioned simply grinds me down completely as far as engagement... Nice try from Marvel but this is just a new attempt at a cash-grab from film enthusiasts... and I certainly hope that they don't fall for it...🙂"
1071,3,"Boring The saddest moment was when the pie fell. I said ""NOO"" loudly. You know that a movie is bad when the strongest emotional connection you form is with a pie. Everything else was a bore. Very self complacent. A waste of time."
1072,8,"According to this movie Thanos is the Good guy. Yes you read this right! Because of Thanos he kept the emergence from happening but the avengers, not knowing the whole cosmic reason of the universe and there ignorance to their existence failed to understand that Thanos did them a favor. Yes people Thanos tried to save everyone's life but eliminating half the population. It took this movie to prove that."
1073,1,JHC Is this for real? OMG. WTF. Did embarrassment just vacate the world? What a appalling load of digested and ejested food. IMDB it's about time you make 0 stars a possibility. This is a watershed moment in cinema reviewing. We need 0 stars now.
1074,7,"A sleeping masterpiece I don't understand the poor reviews on this.Has marvel really lowered the expectation, or altered the standard to what is perceived as cinematic masterpiece. Don't expect the Avengers, this isn't what this is. This is the eternals and this is a new story arch.I feel that this could be viewed as the beginning of something special."
1075,8,Don't look at the reviews first just watching it! Well I liked it. Doesn't seem to be a popular opinion but I thought it was quite good and I'm really looking forward to seeing the next one!! Don't look at.
1076,3,"Feels like a bad DC movie. It had all the ingredients to be a groundbreaking movie, it had the budget, it had the acting talent, it had obviously a hugely talented special effects department, even the direction was of the typical high standard we've come to expect from Marvel movies, the one thing that let the entire movie fail? The script, now I'm not talking about the story here, the premise was terrific and again was of a high calibre, it is the dialogue, dry, devoid of substance, punching verbal holes from one scene to the next but at the same time trying to pull off humour, it fell into the same trap that Justice league & Batman vs Superman fell into...a movie that didn't know what it was meant to be, in the end it was a very impressive looking film but lost in its direction of who & what it was meant to be.."
1077,5,A bit of a mess Just not brilliant. Angelina Jolie is well cast as someone who seems to have no soul. Incredible VFX. Confused script. Enjoyable. Sort of. It is a bit of a mess. Rip off scenes from Evangelion. But that's a masterpiece and Eternals isn't. Okay if you are bored one night and have a Disney+ subscription.
1078,2,"Shame on you Marvel. Over the last decade or so Marvel have not put a foot wrong! So is this an indication of what is to come courtesy of Disney. I'm sorry but this film is terrible. The acting is iffy, the story is suspect to say the least, and well everything about it is poor. If this is Disney, then they should give it back, and apologise. Sorry but don't waste your time with this drivel."
1079,2,Awful Tiresome cliche of superhero movies. Can't help but consider that marvel has reached a new evel of repetition.Yet another save the universe hysteria. Bad and at least 1 hour too long.
1080,2,"Disappointed, Confused and needed more Kit! How can all powerful Eternals be stabbed and in the next scene go to outer space without a suit? Why was there only one Eternal with the power to heal herself? How can they be fine in Outer Space without air when they seem like vulnerable humans on Earth? I was confused.I was excited to see Kit Harington, but he hardly had any screen time. I knew going in that his Game of Thrones brother Richard Madden had a much larger role. But I thought Kit would be more involved as the Black Knight. I was sad that I will have to wait for a future movie for Kit to put on his Black Knight armor.Most of the movie showed battle scenes between the superpowered Eternals and the Deviant creatures. The deviants reminded me of stringy dinosaurs. After awhile, the fights weren't very interesting. Most of the time I was confused. The Eternal's powers didn't seem very effective, and they seemed way too vulnerable."
1081,7,"With the amount of resources it should be more better I never hope much with the movie and I'm not really that disappointed either.I enjoyed because I wasn't thinking too much, if I need to be serious...Well the ertenals created to not evolve I think along with their brains too that learnt nothing for 7000 years to behave. God, please! They act like high schooler group preparing school festival, so many unnecessary conflicts.Stupid Icaris, just kill Ajak by yourself and make the body dissappear then the mission will be completed because no one know what will happen but there will be no drama.The problems nowadays movies they are trying to mix something serious and complicated things (so it looks clever like Oscar worthy movie) to pop culture things for the sake of bigger audiences but mostly it ruined because they can't mixed them well.I actually understand this movie is more than just entertainment. They are trying to give messages about moral and humanity, but it's not delivered well. I received the messages well but as a good movie? It isn't. Rather than better storywriting they put bunches of cliche simple drama.If they approached to be more serious story It has potential to be like The dark Knight or Watchmen and if it be more simplified it will be fun like the other MCU movie but they tried to be both of them but can't handled it.Still looking the sequel, it was okay and hope it got better."
1082,2,"Poor and terrible lighting From the off this just seemed cheesy. Half the film I could t even see what was happening on screen because it was so dark. At first I thought it was my TV, checked other films (to make sure but no problems... I've got a top of the range Samsung 4K so not my TV).Just seemed like and excuse to get other regions invested into the Marvel universe (but without the usual Marvel fun and excitement)."
1083,3,"Confoundingly bad made worse with every apparent fix I don't even know where to begin on this one-it's just sad how such interesting and inclusive cast, great design and ideas, interesting (if strangely familiar) heroes, monumental budget and 2 and a half hours were all thoroughly and completely wasted.Every minute I had hopes, thinking so many exciting outcomes could follow, and they just didn't. Amateurish exposition might be the worst offender, and wooden performances and useless distractions form plot-including an otherwise good antagonist and frustratingly unsatisfying fights-don't help in the slightest. Jarring special effects failures during these ruined otherwise fantastic visuals, too.A lot of it is just people standing around and not knowing what to do, but instead projecting their internal struggles it's just boring. Many of the 156 total minutes were spent on just that. At least the title is accurate.My goodness, how I would love this movie if the characters acted like they actually lived for thousands of years, growing and making decisions, suffering the consequences. Developing, you know, character. How I would enjoy a flashback scene to the ancient past, metaphorical of the struggle with Mahd Wy'ry. I would melt if the aforementioned antagonist was made to tap into a Celestial, or really used for... anything.There is so much potential within.Instead we get bumbling, confused dimwits, all in love with or hating each other and you're told to care without showing or even telling why, endowed with powers they clearly never even learned to use, demonstrating Brownian behavior.And a stupefyingly boring movie."
1084,1,YAWN!!! If you have insomnia watch this movie it will cure you about 30 minutes in. This is the WORST superhero movie. They're just slapping crap together now.
1085,1,"Absolutely without merit A great director forced into a very specific mold. It's awful. The script is awful, the dialogue is awful, the cinematography is bland, the actors all seem to have been told to show no emotion at any point. Some of the cast are downright bad in this.It has no redeeming points at all. As a movie it fails at every level.""We don't interfere in their wars, just literally every other aspect of their society"" sums up the absolute lack of any actual motivation or sense behind the actions of the characters. Far and away the worst Marvel movie, it's Justice League levels of bad.It's almost an achievement to make a movie as bland as this."
1086,5,"Eternally ok Not the best Marvel venture. Some odd casting and an annoying mix of accents - especially American accents 5000 BC - Scottish, Irish, Mexican, and Angelina who barely said anything intelligent. They all turn against one another because the world is about to end and break all allegiances at the stroke of a hat. The comedy is a bit stupid at times and not well set up. It went on too long without feeling like it had a purpose and finished with Harry Styles being introduced to the nonsense. Shame they didn't follow the comic more closely."
1087,1,"WORST MARVEL MOVIE EVER This movie doesn't even look like marvel. Even if it was a random movie it would still be average. Storyline is boring, too fake even for marvel and the only part that actually connects to the MCU are the post credits. The cast is too big, every ten minutes they are on the other side of the world and some explanations make no sense at all. I really expect the sequence to this movie to be better, I was so excited to watch it and it was frustrating."
1088,8,"Amazing and entertaining Oh, my, goodness! I had no idea what to expect from this movie so I am very lucky to not having expectations. I loved this so much I need more of this. After a while I was like 'oh my, a bit more than an hour passed and so many things happened and how will they wrap up this movie in the next 30 minutes?' Then I realized this is not a 1.5 hours movie but a 2.5 hours movie and I was like 'oh yeah, bring it on'! :D I had no idea what is coming and believe me I am very critical with every movies I watch. But this was so amazing and so entertaining I just lost the sense of time and I just enjoyed it very much. And this is what a movie should do to you: enjoy what you see and be entertained without thinking about the next move. So because of this I just let my guard down and enjoyed every step on the movie that was a surprise for me. I enjoyed it really that much that I want to watch the next ""episode"" right now. This is not your superhero movie because it is not about that, so manage your expectations and get ready for entertaining. And Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek and Richard Madden in one movie? Oh, my, goodness! :D Loving it!"
1089,6,"It's a good movie but not a good Marvel movie. To be honest, if this was a non Marvel movie, I'd have given it 8 stars. When you watch a Marvel movie you have certain expectations which this one fails to meet. There's some great scenes and the effects are awesome, but it lacks the Wow factor that most Marvel films have. I didn't find any moment where I'd get excited for a character or a scene. It's a good one time watch."
1090,3,"Disappointing I didn't expect much to be honest, even beforehand I was already pretty sceptic but somehow the movie still managed to disappoint.If you're a mcu fan I would still say you should watch it, it's not so horrible as to be unwatchable but because there are so many characters, a lot of plotholes as well as quite a lot of other stuff I won't explain further as this movies top reviews all do that enough.I think if The Eternals would've been a series at least the character problem could've been solved.But alas that's not the case, so we're left with this."
1091,1,Just No Had to stop watching it as it was just grim and utterly boring. The romantic plot line overrides everything - if I wanted a love story I'd watch Pride & Prejudice.Casting was very questionable. CGI even more so.I did not expect such trash from Marvel. Urgh!
1092,6,It's a 6 Not bad a new story and very different but not good either. It's that movie you watch when you don't have nothing to do.I love Angelina Jolie even though she almost never appear or talk.
1093,5,Senseless movie Senseless movie with a great cast. Surprised you can spend millions of dollars and make rubbish like this.I thought Age of ultron and Ragnarok were the worst in the Marvel universe. Then comes Eternals!
1094,9,"One on the best Wow, I really liked the story, the plot and the characters. Each of them is well written and their interactions are beautiful.A good Marvel movie.Can't wait to see the next step in the MCU."
1095,1,What the heck... Skip to the 2 hour mark if you're a fan of MCU action movies. I've seen Hallmark movies with better drama. And the constant inclusiveness barrage is so tiresome. Can't we just watch a movie.
1096,10,NEW MCU YAS !! This is the new mcu !! Please make more of this and not those silly kiddy movies that was trying so hard to get into comedy and wasn't even funny or entertaining at all . Eternals is the best among the rest !! The plot twist is very unpredictable and no scripts are wasted .
1097,1,"boring The movie is so slow. I am a die hard marvel fan and love the cast of game of thrones. But I felt like sleeping through the movie. And that's not the worst part. The movie is devoid of any relateable characters. It edges on baiting the audience by bringing in topics like Indian culture, same sex marriage and deaf heroes. But none of them work.First of all Druig, the character who is solely invested in saving mankind and use of non violence. He should be advocating for stopping the emergence but he is reluctant. Why?Akaris and sersi, after a marriage of 5000 years he suddenly leaves and when he appears again she doesn't demand an explanation. I mean where is the anger? Or the disappointment? When he does try to tell her where he went; some deviant attacks and that story arc comes into play way later in the climax.Thena turns on fellow eternals after what happened at centuri-6. Why? If she hates that eternals are harvesting humans for celestial emergence then she is also complicit, she doesn't self harm or anything. To avoid this they have (mawd-behr ?)something which seems like a plug to be honestKingo, entire arc was thought to be funny for being Bollywood but for someone who is from India. I missed the laughs. The entire Bollywood sequence needed better direction. The camera doesn't move that slow in Bollywood scenes. And there was no redemption arc for kingo.Sprite and her unrequited love for akaris was a plot line that was okay to watch. But they could have edited it more for better impact.Sersi entire power is touching things to turn them. In the entire climax she touches stuff in the last 5 mins. I was shouting since the fight started the entire time. ""Touch the ground. See what happens. "" but no she had to be stabbed. She deserved that.At the end Ikaris randomly flies into sun ? At that point I was like ok. None of the movie made sense why should this ?"
1098,1,"Worst movie ever? How is this not rated as the worst movie ever? Think about the budget, think about the storyline, think about the characters? Is IMDB filled with Disney bots? I cannot take this movie seriously in any way. Did I miss something?"
1099,6,"Flat, Disjointed, Disappointing It has all been written before by far more eloquent reviewers than I ----- but I'm SO disappointed by ""Eternals"" ---- please allow me to try and rid myself of my angst by echoing so many of the other bad reviews.What was with the beginning? We we supposed to somehow magically know who these guys are? I didn't. Somehow we're just supposed to be familiar with them and their lives? I felt like I'd been dropped into things in the middle, lost and bewildered. I rewound to the beginning ---- did I miss some key point?What a drag. I nearly turned it off after 15 minutes, the whole thing was so badly done. Was it the editing? The direction? Why did everything seem so FLAT? The CGI ------ ghastly, amateurish. Is this really MCU?Great cast, but there was no connection, for me, to any of them. What's with the one being so young? Let's proceed to jump back and forth in the timeline and leave the audience to figure out the WHY of everything. Bah.Angelina Jolie seemed seriously out of place. And as much as I like Kit Harrington, his entire role seemed like some whimsical afterthought: Shouldn't our protagnonist (if that's what she is?) have a love relationship in the here and now? He's some all-accepting, unquestioning milksop that just goes along with his girlfriend being a super weirdo?Okay. That's enough. I watched it till the end. Some reviewers said they watched it twice, just to make sure they weren't being unreasonable in their bad reviews. Haha. You couldn't PAY ME to watch it again."
1100,5,"Worst MCU Film Yet!!! 'Eternals' is the latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is arguably one of the most ambitious films of this franchise. Ambition doesn't automatically substitute for quality however. Trust me I love the MCU, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that there is a certain formula that these films often follow, normally it isn't completely obvious but this time round it is glaringly apparent that 'Eternals' has fallen into the modern day Marvel formula.The epitome of falling into a formula is taking an Oscar winning director like Chloé Zhao, who is one of the brightest and most talented young directors working today, and even someone of that calibre churns out a piece of boring drab. It doesn't all fall on Zhao however, the cast is, on the face of it, full of big hitters from Angelina Jolie ('Thena') to Richard Madden ('Ikaris') but even their acting is wooden. Madden looks bored for 90% of the picture and who can blame him when the script is so poor.As for that poor script, this is one of the weakest the MCU has bought to the table. There is absolutely zero character development for pretty much every character apart from possibly Sersi (played by Gemma Chan), Sprite (played by Lia McHugh) and at a push Phastos (played by Brian Tyree Henry). Now this is a film where there are at least ten characters in the titular team, that isn't a good thing. That is the heart of the issue though, ten characters, ten main characters, already that is way too many, especially when we haven't met any of them before. Zhao had the impossible task of introducing ten new heroes and trying to draw the audience into caring for them. If they had lowered the number, it would've been much easier and would've given the writers time to properly introduce everyone. When Marvel try to adapt a project that is pretty much unknown even to hardcore fans of the comics, they need to give them relatable quirks that helps the audience empathise with them so if anything happens to them during the movie, we actually care. Sadly that doesn't happen here and I couldn't care less about any of the main characters.The writing itself also left a lot to be desired. From very vaguely defined plot points which are yet another thing that the writers must've felt weren't important. As for the 'shock' twist reveal of the main villain, what a waste. They spend a decent amount of the screentime 'setting up' Kro (voiced by Bill Skarsgard) as the antagonist just to opt for another villain. They had the potential of casting this phenomenal actor as your main adversary, but they squandered it.One could only hope that this film at least has some semblance of a thematic prowess about it, but that will also leave you disappointed. I believe the key theme the writers were trying to discuss was family and how these otherworldly beings work within a family structure. On paper, it would seem they cover the concept, but once you begin to delve into it, you realise that the filmmakers only covered the bare minimum with no real substance behind any of the characters relationships. Another theme that this film attempts to wrestle with is the question, what does it mean to be human? They definitely discussed this, but they don't dive into it at all with any character. The main protagonist that could've been explained more was Lauren Ridloff's 'Makkari'. They had a really interesting dynamic with how she copes with being deaf and having to live in a new world, but obviously did not think it was a priority.As bad as I've made it sound, there are some positives, the key one being the effects. As always with modern day blockbusters, the CGI is fairly flawless, with a blend of visual effects and practically built sets meaning that the world that is crafted feels authentic. It helps in making the film feel grand and huge in scale.Overall, this is a real disappointment. From poor writing, to lack of character development, this is riddled with shoddy errors which all adds up to making this film the worst that the MCU has made.5/10."
1101,6,"for the fans and all... About the marvel superhero universe, and my universal vision is that there aint much twist in the goodybag, they tend to last too long and the plotspeed unbelievably slow, the scripted dialouges are itchingly irritatingly bad and expected and the grumpy old men like me strives to stay awake through 150 minutes...i'm not over excited by the choice of cast, and the casts delivery that seems like stumbling and commanded at moments, and that may also be due to bad ''taken water over thy head'' direction. I do also react that they do not use indeginous peoble like a samii or an aborigin actor in the superhero choir...an idea to follow up?But some things are good, vfx and cgi do make this a viewable encounter, the score is good, and the hindi-punjabi insertions of ''birdie num num'' comedy made me smile inbetween. So if you have a wooden club that you cut notches in for each superhero movie you have seen, then its a go for it.for us norwals ill recommend a try but not more than that..."
1102,4,"Ceaseless... There's nothing new here that you'll find, to fascinate, engage or spellbind, it goes on far too long, sub plots aren't that strong, irregular and far from streamlined - but there's some nice CGI and a guy from Avatar makes a guest appearance."
1103,1,"Worse movie ever created by marvels studio This is the worse movie ever created by marvel studio.Poor character and fake kisses....is this become a romantic heroes movies?? If so, play it professionally!! So Fake...better focus on what you good at , Marvel! Don't venture into unfamiliar territories!"
1104,3,"Humans not involved so I couldn't relate Eternals, celestials, deviants... I don't know them. This movie was like Transformers fighting among themselves but WITHOUT humans involved at all. It was hard to get invested.Maybe they should have told the story in Dane's POV and put that one man's life in danger from the Deviants or something... I just wanted to care for one human being at least."
1105,1,"Secular Humanism If you are looking for a secular humanist allegory of deconstructed faith and the death of the patriarchy, Marvel's ""Eternals"" is your one stop shop. The cinematography is beautiful. The story, quite compelling. It is a shame that the substance is so hollow and ultimately, self-defeating."
1106,5,"The kind of movies that I hate It's one of the kinds of movies I hate which are like someone rambling on beside you without a trace of care or empathy for wasting your time. I mean, the visuals are not bad. But the story progression is awful."
1107,10,"The Storyline was Excellent The Storyline for Eternals was excellent, in my opinion it was exactly what was needed to carry the MCU into its next era. It was long due to it being a new storyline. But the ending, the characters and the actors were all excellent I certainly hope we get a sequel and more from The Eternals."
1108,1,"Avoid If you have any standards to what you call entertainment please avoid this. Not sure how this concept and story made it to production. Comic book movies and super hero franchisees have drastically reduced the standard of movies in general but this is just bottom of the barrel stuff, yet it maintains a 6.7 rating, which is beyond me."
1109,3,Boring This ismby far the worst of the Marvel movies so far. It's slow and actually boring. The acting is decent overall. The sex scene was a bit much for a marvel movie and very unnecessary.
1110,1,no one needs this...no one asked for this 90 min in the move and still wondering when the movie starts. Know what i mean? The story feels useless and raises more questions than it gives answers. It adds no value to the MCU...just money to Disneys bank account. Sad but true story...I think its time for the MCU to do a few Star Wars like sabath years maybe....
1111,3,Wasted potential This movie would have been amazing if it were an 'endgame' of a cumulative franchise that told us the story of each eternal as they lived out their years on Earth.Instead we got a suicide squad marvel movie with a jumbled mashup of people that we just do not care about.
1112,5,"Eternally long and boring The movie seems like a democratic attempt in trying to represent people of every background, with a poor storyline to bind the characters or sequences together. The movie is just plain repetitive, monster hunt by super heroes with familiar powers. There is no freshness to the movie, the storyline with the cast is unconvincing, and it is an effort to sit through the film."
1113,9,"Was better than what others say. For me it was an absolute spectacle. The cinematograhy's beautiful, the cast are amazing, the cgi is on spot! And finally the story is BEAUTIFUL.Here we go with the story.. TBH it won't resonate with everybody ESPECIALLY those who are not solid fans of the MCU and the COMICS. This movie seriously is a fresh take to the marvel and superhero genre! It's a story about the BEGINNING.I get why others don't like it because let me tell you this movie is more about WORLD BUILDING and STORY-TELLING. It demands expositions and not just action stuffs. I actually love it's narrative and I enjoyed getting lost deep in it's lore.This also aims to be different with other previous MCU movies and it perfectly do so. Overall, I loved it and I can't tell you how much more i'm mesmerized by this movie opposite to what others tell."
1114,8,"Cinematic! This movie isn't your usual Marvel film, it's not the flying around blowing things up while making funny jokes movie you're used to from them, not that there's anything wrong with those. This is a nuanced more subdued from that focuses on the relationships of is characters and the fact this film spans thousands of years means there is a lot to go over yet I think it was handled very well with an atmosphere more similar to Dune than another Marvel movie."
1115,4,"Maybe, Maybe not If you want 40 minutes of action and a lot of drawn out dialog this is the movie for you. Otherwise, I'd pass and take a walk in nature. Very disappointing plot, execution, and flow to a film. Half way through I was ready to end it. But I grinned and bared it and it definitely was not worth it. Save you time, watch Avengers again."
1116,2,"Good effects - and nothing more I tried to watch this movie, and for the first 13 minutes nothing happens except useless and out of context conversations. Literally, this 8% of the movie is pointless. With much effort I've reached 33 minutes before quit.They focused so hard one unimportant things like diversity and shinny things that forgot make the movie interesting."
1117,4,"Extremely boring and blunt characters! I wasted 2,5 Hours with this movie. I dont care about the characters, i dont like them, i didn't believe their motives. Godlike creatures who lived millions of years are still dumb and primitive. Just like us normal people! Dont watch this. Cgi is awful, creatures are not cool but generic and dull!"
1118,1,"I can't understand how this is so bad? 200M Budget and it feels like some kind of tacky mini series on FX or something. I had to turn it off after about 20 minutes, I just couldn't go on. And I never turn a movie off, well maybe once before in 34 years, ONCE.It's just unwatchable. Actors I love from other things are at their very worst in this and I cannot understand it. The CGI was terrible, the sound mixing (something I've never commented on in my life, I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to tell) was so lifeless.I wouldn't be a Marvel fanboy by any means, but I do love the films for the cinematic value, which this delivered precisely zero of, so there was nothing for me.Sorry to moan but if this saves one person 2 hrs 37 minutes of their time, I'll be glad."
1119,2,"Star-Studded Flop I've really enjoyed the MCU. With this cast and the buildup I expected a good story and exciting characters, I got neither. The directing was atrocious with no subtlety in the camera angles. It was like a children's pageant- the actors took turns standing in the view of the camera and the background could have been a felt board. The characters were detached and unrelatable, the entire plot development relied on an uninteresting and long monologue by a motionless and flat psuedo-character that could have been played by pictures of a plastic action figure. There was no consistency in the action scenes and CGI and no explanation for any action by the characters other than undeveloped and invisible motivation. So, poor directing, poor movement, no character development, no relatability and a complete dump of a movie that I hope doesn't have a sequel."
1120,1,"Marvel copying DC. Marvel has shamelessly copied DC's superheroes. They've just copied superman, wonder woman etc and put them into a neat group with an incredibly cliche and predictable plot. Absolutely shameless."
1121,6,"Bland entry into the MCU They all seem so weak. The fights against the Deviants were really lame. When Ajak was talking about humans to Ikaris, she almost said ""I've seen them live, laugh, love"" lol Dialogue was cringe at times. Introduce celestial, fine, but Galactus should have been the one people seen in the sky and he should have been the one to kill Tiamut."
1122,8,Wow I like this movie. The film is good in terms of cinematography and cgi. The action of this film is quite a bit.this movie shouldn't have a s£x scene because pg13 movie8/10.
1123,8,"Had low expectations after the reviews.. I'm on my second viewing now and wow, this movie is just awesome! I watched it first on 12th January and I was blown away, now I'm watching this again and it's amazing!If you are Marvel or Not, You will definitely like this movie, the story was flawless and it's visually stunning.I can never understand the Hate on this movie! My favorite character Gilgamesh by the way. Happy viewing."
1124,10,"Doesn't deserve the bad reviews This movie awesome and action packed. I don't understand the bad reviews this is the first Eternals movie for the MCU , like what. Totally uncalled for , people are rating it before they even watched it. I like this movie , totally worth the hype and I love how it's flashes between the past and present, via flashbacks of course. Unique characters and their powers are so diverse too. The plot twists were also Great. Don't let the bad reviews discourage you from watching this masterpiece and frankly just fantastically addictive movie. This is the first movie for these superheroes and I hope to see more of them in the MCU."
1125,7,"Lucky heroes stopping the ""Destruction of Earth"" So, a little ball sent to the core of the earth only to grow up to be a planet size ""prime"" in line with the growth of the population of the earth. Now, looking at the population growth rate historically, that prime should have grown by 8 times in the last 200 years. Sorry but that prime did not have to break out from the core to destroy the earth.. A particular matter growing by 8 times in 200 years and reaching to mass where it is maybe half of Earth's total mass in the core of Earth would have destroyed the life as we know it way before.. Let's say somehow by a miracle it did not, and let's say more interestingly no one was aware of this growth in earth's mass somehow.. Prime's breaking from the earth, reaching out by one hand through the Indian Ocean again should have destroyed the life as we know it independent of our group of heroes turning it to well marble apparently. Other than this huge issue, it was a fun movie to watch to be honest.."
1126,3,"A turkey of a movie - and it shouldn't have been. I am not at all familiar with the source material of this movie, so I can't comment on how faithful this movie is to it. I can say that this movie contains a lot of very interesting, clever and novel ideas. This had the basic materials to be something special, instead it is a mess. The writers, producers and director should be ashamed. I don't think I have ever seen so much potential wasted. Dull characters, a weak script, confusing flashbacks and flash forwards, and absolutely lame and cringeworthy attempts to inject humor. This movie is a mess. True, if you manage to get through the first 30 minutes without switching off, it does get better though and by the end you might even care about what happens, even if you don't care about any of the characters. This film goes for around 155 minutes, which seems really excessive. It wouldn't have though, if the story had been told well. Time would have flown by. Instead it drags. Quite obviously this is an important movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like another movie with the same importance though, Captain Marvel, this is a dud. The thing is, the after credit scenes suggest a sequel to this is intended. The sequels better be better than this. New writers and director would help."
1127,3,Strong direction and Weak story A typical Marvel movie with a typical story nothing new or imaginative. Story and direction didnt mix together. Editing was somewhat bad it felt like literally different acting takes were mixed together which gave an off vibe.
1128,5,"It doesn't make any sense The production is fine, but it's a long, tough and frustrating watch because of the number of plot holes and legitimate questions that won't go away. If the Eternals aren't permitted to intefere with human development, what exactly was their job for thousands of years? They don't DO anything except fight the Deviants (whose origin and purpose is as unclear as everything else). With a timeline of millennia, the writers could have gone deep, gothic or prophetic and linked the Eternals with characters or events from Egyptian, Greek or biblical mythology. If the 'emergence' is directly related to global population numbers, they could have made Thanos' 'snap' THE event that interrupted this process and forced the Eternals into action. Instead of any of this, we are presented with a group of weak, unknown characters who just seem to be aimlessly floating alongside humanity (and the MCU) with no clear, grounded purpose. Add to this lots of dialogue, clunky exposition with only a couple of jokes that land and Eternals is a flat, static wasted opportunity. I could write something more interesting than this with only a set of Tarot cards for inspiration."
1129,1,"Don't waste your time with this movie!!! What a waste of time, not even worth rating it or watching it at the cinema...I hope MUC next big movie isn't like this stupid movie. Marvel need to hurry up and bring the X-Men onto the MUC."
1130,8,"Not your typical Marvel Movie! This is really bold of Marvel do go with this direction cause this is not your typical Marvel Movie or typical Supeheroe Movie.I kind of love and hate the divide of this film.On one side people love Chloe's vision with Eternals including me as it is diffrend and more of a art than a typical supeheroe movie.Then on the other side we have people who think the Movie is mediokre and messy.The Eternals itself is a very Complex Comic Book and i think Chloe does a interesting take and tells a character driven film that is willing to take it times and still manage to have a really intriguing story.In my personal opinion I think the score of 6,4 is a underrated rating as i fins this Movie is more artsy than the other Marvel films.But i Also Appreciate the other Marvel films. So I can also understand that some people prefer Avengers over this but they are completely diffrends type of films.The only thing that connect them is that they are set in the Marvel cinematic universe.I hope you like this honest review.I really like the phasing of this film and the artsy direction and the Vfx is really outstanding and magnificent.Rating 8/10."
1131,10,One of the best MCU movies ever released Can't really understand why people hate this movie so much...must be because it has a lot to take in but that should not be a way to criticize this movie...Out of all the MCU movies I think this is on the top when it comes to storyline and visual effects...Many didn't like the concept of eternals here but more like it's how universe works...just enjoy the movie...it's marvel...they never disappointed us in all these years and they won't in the coming sequels too...
1132,2,"What a mess!! From the beginning to the end, it was a mess, going back and forth in time.It is horrible in every way. EEEEWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!What the hell, Marvel?I thought this is going to be special, but the direction and storyline and the characters are just a kind of joke."
1133,3,"Why? It's pretty long, uninspiring stuff. Huge cast that isn't really put to much use. Did I mention it was long? Nothing of real interest happens, visuals are hit and miss. Some are great, but most are at best, OK."
1134,1,"Simply awful. How this is scoring about 3/10 is beyond me I'll start off by saying I'm a massive marvel fan boy.I've watched all films multiple times, love the source material and are generally first in the queue to see a new movie.This was a huge disappointment! It's dull, too long, the characters are underdeveloped / border line unlikeable.The plot doesn't really seem to fit with what has already been established in the MCU.I mean we've got an Celestial growing within the depths of the earths core and Stephen and Wong, or oven Tilda Swintons sorcerer supreme was completely unaware of this?CGI wasn't great either, when the deviants absorbs one of the enternals powers and becomes anthropomorphic he just looked awful (kind of reminded me of the old power rangers misters from the 90's show) There was no sense of dread or hoping that our heroes would succeed.Salma and Angelena were both dull which is a shame as too great actresses but with that script and you would presume direction their talents are largely wasted.The only saving grace was that I fell asleep 10 mins before the end so was saved the pain of having to watch Harry Styles Eros.I've rewatched all Marvel films multiple times. I can't see a time where I wi ever sit down and rewatch this."
1135,1,Disappointed with marvels This movie is completely wasting of times. Though I like some visual effects in this movie. Otherwise storyline and cast was very inappropriate. Marvel's trying to make another nonsense creature without any doubt. I really disappoint again with Marvel's movies.
1136,1,Marvel's worst movies I only like some visual effects. Storyline was very much illogical for many reasons. I already wasted my time for movie and not interested to waste any for explaining it.But still marvel is my favorite.
1137,2,Funny but seriously Stop going to Disneyland. Stop giving them money. (This next part is filler) Growing up in so cal I was fortunate to see Disney change our lives. That dream died with Walt. Money can only lead to more money. Nothing less. Ps. Don't make anymore movies.
1138,3,"They were due a bad one at some point! Where to begin. Marvel were sadly due a terrible one at sooner or later. This film was so bad we had to switch it off an hour in. Story was poor, characters were given no intros so how can we care, casting was probably the worst in Hollywood history, acting makes Sharknado look like The Godfather, and the special effects were dire. For the sake of mankind, bury this film."
1139,2,"Should have asked someone else to be the director It's like Ang Lee's Hulk all over again. The story, the characters all have so much potential but the director ruined the movie. Two stars gives to the visual effects."
1140,3,"Meh!! Didn't enjoy this at all, storyline all over the place and confusing. Acting was pretty appalling which isn't great given the actors that were in it!Boring and unnecessary film all around.Be careful Marvel your starting to spread yourself too thin.."
1141,8,"Purest example of superheroes as Greek mythological characters The story concerns the Eternals, a group of beings who facilitate the births of Celestials who are the ersatz ""gods"" of the universe. Turns out, they ensure the growth of the universe by sucking the power of people on a planet to facilitate the birth of a new celestial which in-turn destroys the planet. So, comfortable in their new lives as people on earth, the eternals set out to thwart the plan, to stop the celestial birth and save the planet. This is pure fantasy, in the vein of Greek creation and god mythologies and well-done. The actors are all very good, and the computer FX pretty peerless. My attention was held by it, despite my aversion to most superhero stories concerning the various multiverses. Mostly, this is a good way to bring the concept of Greek mythology to the rest of the planet and Westerners, who are no longer taught it in schools."
1142,4,"Eternals Eternals are a bunch of ancient super heroes put on earth thousands of years ago to save mankind from vicious monsters - deviants. After ridding the planet of the creatures, they are forced to come back together in the present day when the monsters start reappearing, seemingly with greater powers.Different in tone from the other MCU films, and really with no real connection to them, this kicks off with a fun first 45 minutes, but then shifts into a far more serious place as the truth behind what's really going on emerges. Sadly, the story itself is a terrible, poorly conceived mess hampered considerably by largely dull characters who you just want to slap, particularly Gemma Chan, the ostensible lead and Angelina Jolie, who both seems to regret having signed on. Others do better with a reasonable turn from Richard Madden and even better performances, and crucially much needed fun from Brian Tyree Henry and Harish Patel.The set pieces with expected top notch special effects are goodly on the eye, but this doesn't compensate for a daft story and uninteresting characters."
1143,4,Terribly slow Took more than half of film in just developing the characters and story...very hard to stick with the movie... vfx is good.. angelina jolie role is wasted.
1144,10,"Awesome Awesome movie I think this is best movie but in this movie equality is not in a proper way. So I suggest in next part all eternals are in same group, In this movie I like all character but mostly I like Tina. All eternals dress is mind-blowing but all have power to fly and in this some have more power and some have less this is not fair."
1145,4,"What a waste! The film is pathetic from all points of view, bored actors and chosen totally inappropriate for this film, banal special effects and too many and the story itself is ridiculously right.Shame, I would have expected more from Marvel Studios, they certainly started to focus more on quantity and not quality."
1146,8,"One of the best additions to the MCU and one of the best Origin stories so far! I don't know how a movie like Eternals could be so underappreciated. No, its not Infinity War or an Endgame with almost a decade's worth of character building, including the antagonist who achieved what most antagonist don't ""Winning!"", but its also not your stereotypical heroes unite expecting to have won come the credits. It's a unique addition to the universe that could almost classify as a standalone sci fi.The only ""downsides"" are the fight scenes early in the movie that are specifically meant to showcase the strength on the ""heros"", not enough screentime for the ""villain"", and one plot hole that didn't make a lot sense.Other than that, its definitely a movie worth watching and I'm personally excited to see how these characters are integrated into the battlefield with the rest of our MCU heros."
1147,7,Not a bad one. Eternals takes u to the dark side of Gods and how they use their creation for their own purposes. Story is really great and not to mention expands the marval universe. The troubling thongh with that movie is its way too emotional we know they had to show their emotional attachments wit earth but vhloe zaho took it to other level in a bad way. Other than that eternals got everything to become the important part of marvel family...
1148,4,Didn't get a sense of actors enjoying their parts. MCU movies the characters have different motivations but to date have been fully engaged in their parts. Didn't feel that here. With some exceptions there just seems to be a lack of energy and engagement. There are a few touching moments. Then they big dramatic scenes come across as if the actors did all their takes separately instead of reacting to each other. I was excited to see this new chapter in the verse but feel left flat by the finished product. We know several of theses actors can and have brought that energetic fighting spirit and a broader commedic talent that could easily have been balanced with the excellent physicallity. Maybe a bit to much stress was given to effects when good acting chops gets alot done.
1149,7,"A meaningful intended movie... Nor bad, not best, but a week developed movie. Give it a chance and get messages of your own by your own. It has the best Flash / DC.Effects 10 Acting 9 Story 8 Photography 8 Scenarios 10 Costumes 8 Enemies 7 Game changing 8 Timescore 7 Ending 7 Post credits 6."
1150,5,"Struggle bus This movie was hard to sit through. Some bright moments made the dull spots even more dry by contrast. The premise seemed to undermine the gravity of everything else in the MCU while still not being interesting enough to keep me from checking my phone. (Also why are the externals humanoids with regional accents?)Cast turned in good individual performances but they didn't mesh. Like tomatoes and pickles go great on a sandwich, but not so great in a milkshake.I think a few tweaks could have made this a classic."
1151,9,"Finally a good movie to watch I'm never a fan of marvel movies. I loved the first iron man as it was a great story but since then all their movies have been dull, just not super heroes, more special effects more action, just super boring. Then something changed and we're good something original with shang shi and now this. To be honest I looked doctor who but they ruined it by putting the super heroes from marvel in it. It should have been just that story that reality those characters.This movie was great, it had an original story, some comedy but never enough to make it cringy like usually marvel movies do.Great special effects, very good acting, good characters and a new take on the gods view.Good pacing, very entertaining. This is why i watch movies.This was almost as good as shang shi.On a regular year i might have rated it 8. But these past 2 years movies have been so bad that this one deserves the 9 as a standout."
1152,8,"Neither great nor bad Too much useless side plots and poor acting skills. However, the main plot is very intriguing and the story progress is great. I would give 7 but I think this movie is getting less than it deserves, so 8."
1153,5,Boring and the worst marvel movie so far! We expected this movie to be good but it turns out to be the worst movie in the mcu!. No way close to Shang chi and other marvel movies. The characters are not interesting at all as an example Ajak. In my opinion they have wasted the most important eternal! And they have exaggerated some averagely powerful internals like Sprite and Gilgamesh. Sersi's character was not interesting at all either.
1154,7,"Above average but disappointing This movie is above average and I enjoyed watching it but at the same time it disappoint because expectations were higher. It lack good story and good villains, Plot seemed little bit confusing to me and many questions remained unanswered. Stars like Kit Harrington, Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolly are not properly utilized. However, It is still not a bad movie."
1155,5,"Immortal beings I thought Eternals (2021) was just ok. I thought the same thing when I saw Thor: The Dark World (2013), it did not do much but had cool action and good characters.Eternals (2021) has good cinematography and has a lot of pretty locations, along with great visuals when you learn more about them.The actors playing the Eternals are good and play out dramatic scenes well. There are a lot of characters to introduce in one movie, so it is hard to know more about them and who they are.The action is staged well and looks cool, but the movie feels slow and can be boring until a certain plot point. It is mostly them talking about what is going on, but the plot and what they are made for is interesting.Like most people have said, they should have made this into a MCU show to get more character development and to understand more about the characters. They are not wrong.The explanation for what they are really doing was a little surprising and the ending made me ask ""what?"". One of the after credits scenes is a little questionable but the other one is a little exciting.I do not know what to say other than saying I understand why people do not like this. I did not hate this, but I did not love it as much as the other MCU movies.But it is just ok. It is just standard until the 3rd act, which did pick up the movie a bit. If you want to watch this, go ahead, and see for yourself."
1156,5,"Second half was decent. The first half was pretty boring, not sure why Jon Snow was in this at all. Second half was decent. The best part was the Superman VS Flash fight on the beach."
1157,2,Ignorant writers and director The director and writer should kneel down and apologize to the victims of the Nanjing Massacre and to the Chinese people who were violated by the Japanese army.
1158,8,It didn't meet the hype but still a pretty good movie I honestly think it's a really good movie i think the hype was way too high that people expected something like endgame so it took so much bad ratings I watched on Disney plus months after it came out was not expecting something high (my expectations was pretty low) and I actually enjoyed the movie so much I think years from now will look back at this movie with a better view.
1159,1,Boring This is a completely overrated movie it has nothing to do with marvel. This movie is boring and has no real topic and just try's to go with social norms.
1160,5,"A bit slow, but overall full of quite intense action scene! Really should watch it! This film start with an article indicate about a mission led by Prime Eternal ""Ajak"", and the Eternals saving a bunch of human from the killing of the Deviants scene! As turnout, this film is about the member of the Eternals ""Sersi"" need to kill Tiamut with her power to save the earth! Entire film full of quite intense action scene! Such as, fighting with laser eye, punching, explosion, things broken, fighting with magical weapon, shooting, stabbing, flying, and car crash! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, Sersi killed Tiamut, and Ikaris fly to the sun to kill himself! Still have two post credit scene! First one, brother of Thanos ""Eros"" offer help to find the captured Eternals! Second one, an unknown people asking Dane is he ready to use the Ebony Blade! That's it! A quite entertain film!"
1161,1,Marvel's First Bust I was trying to get to a point where I could feel invested in a single one of these characters but just could. Two and a half hours of fluff with no substance.
1162,4,Eternally boring This movie was a total piece of trash. No character development and nonsensical plot. Don't waste your time. Might I add it is 2 and a half hours long?
1163,4,"Eternal..ly dreadful plot If you're looking for an action fest... kinda... and can ignore a story line that just drags on, boy are you gonna love this.Okay, Angelina Jolie in warrior mode and kicking monster butt... sure, who's gonna object to that? But from the beginning to the post-credit nonsense (which even hardcore comics fans may have to hit the Net to understand)... this plot just plods along.This film is jump-the-shark ridiculous (okay, maybe a little interesting, but really?). The Eternals themselves are absolutely nothing like what comic book readers would have expected, and the overall product is just droll. Some individuals may love it... but the ratings overall aren't showing a lotta love.By the end of the film I was so sick of gold-wire special effects I wanted to barf rainbows.Yay for the short-ish character in the post-credits. (No spoilers here.) An old favorite of mine and portrayed pretty well.The Eternals themselves were seriously unimpressive. ""Immortals"" who would actually be killed (apparently) by any crook with an Uzi simply aren't all that impressive. They can take being bashed halfway across a continent but can be stabbed with a knife? Really?Yet another disappointment from a long-anticipated film. I know it's difficult to forecast how a movie is going to come across in the end, but sometimes I have to wonder if Marvel ever puts these scripts through a limited multi-interest fan group to see if the film stands a chance. ""Dude, this script sux"" could go a long way in preventing such films from ever hitting the market.The ultimate question (the one that always tips the scale): Would I watch it again? Definitely not. That's my spear-to-the-heart touch stone for any film."
1164,10,Dont believe the low ratings I almost didnt watch because the strange suspicious low ratings.The directing is great and dynamic. I later found out it was a great new female director from China. Well done.The movie almost had that feeling of those exciting scenes from the old HK Bruce Lee action movies.The script was good. The cinematography was excellent.Great mixed Asian and Latino cast . One the lead actresses Gemma is from HK but English educated and she was much better than I expected.Angelina Jolie and the Game of throne guy did great . The editing was good and CGI was much better than expected.. overall much better than 90% the trash from Hollywood (eg Wonder woman 1984 ).It's not family friendly though.The fighting scenes were realistic. The story had a good pace. Definitely worth watching. I might even watch it a second time later.
1165,1,Stupid movie Marvel really screwed up with this one.. really disappointed and disgusted with the R rated scenes!! I was shocked while watching it with my 5 year old!! Super hero movies shouldn't be like this!!!!
1166,3,"Meh It's ok. My wife likes marvel movies so I watched it. Thought the trailer looked real good! Movie was just ok. Some real cool moments, but actually pretty boring all in all. And it's long in the tooth. CGI not always good... A bit cheesy. Smoke a lot of pot before watching it."
1167,5,"Like a painting at Red Lobster Looks fine at a glance, but spend close to 3 hours with it and it's kind of a mess. Should've stuck closer to Kirby and/or Gaiman. Like the actors, but not everyone quite fit. Probably should've been 2 movies and then they throw in Black Knight AND Blade (and Batman and Superman)?! Okay Kevin. Not with you on this one."
1168,10,"It's actually good, why do so many dislike it? The movie is a deviation from the typical marvel formula. Maybe it's because I went into this expecting it to be mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit into the MCU. The music wasn't just placeholder which is rare for marvel and the actors were quite good. While it's long, it does justify its length. Honestly one of the better marvel movies in my opinion."
1169,4,Not worth your time I saw a preview when I visited Disney Hollywood Studios and was excited for the film. Overall I only enjoyed two charles. It felt so bad compared to all Marvel films. No humor and the storyline was poorly developed. Many great actors who were placed in a bad film.
1170,6,"If this is what the end of the world looks like, at least we'll have front-row seats... Sersi, Ikaris, Thena, Ajak, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, and Gilgamesh are the Eternals, a race of immortal beings from the planet Olympia that came to earth 7000 yrs ago and have watched humankind ever since. They were sent by a celestial named Arishem to defend Earth against a predatory alien race called the Deviants. While all the Eternals are very powerful beings (each in different ways), they were commanded to watch but not to interfere in the affairs of mankind unless the Deviants were involved.Arishem also told the Eternals that after they'd wiped out all the Deviants he would send for them to come home to Olympia. That they need only wait for word from him,,,This movie is visually spectacular. It has a really great cast. Good score. It just does not feel like an MCU movie imo! Idk,, it's not bad,, certainly not great either,, it's just a bit hollow. I agree with imdb, I'd say it's a 6.7 rating."
1171,2,Too much bollywood Absolute frustrating.Its like mixing the worst chapter of Game of Thrones with a romantic version of X-men .Sama Hayek's english accent is terrific.When I listen to her I feel like being raped by a herd of horny mammuts.
1172,4,"Not quite! I expected much more from this film. I guess lately Marvel looks a bit confused with introducing new heroes. First of all, casting is very unconvincing. Two guys that still can't get away from their GoT roles, two washed up actresses, and the average rest. If they wanted to introduce celestials to Marvel universe there were much better ways. I saw some Avatar look a like monsters called Deviants, but they were so lame, and Kro, what was that? Totally wasted potential villain.. I thought that Shang Chi was bad, but I guess I was wrong. Now we wait for John Snow to turn into a Black Knight. And Harry Stiles, really.."
1173,3,"How much can 1 child carry a movie? I mean really, how much can one child carry this movie? I am surprised Angelina Jolie took this roll. From badass to crying, hiding, having a man protect her and told to ""stay"" like a dog. I was waiting for her to kick ass but no. Kumaril had an fun part and played it very well but the Sprite, Lia McHughs character, Brian Tryee at least gave us something to watch."
1174,2,"Dafuq did I just watch? Eternals is an epic failure worthy of Patty Jenkins. The story made no sense, you don't care about the characters, and the entire story is a flaming dumpster fire from the get go. At least unlike a patty jenkins movie, none of the characters raped an unwilling participant. Only the viewers will feel raped of their time and sanity watching this stinkpile picture."
1175,6,"Difficult to pinpoint why it's not good I'm being a little generous giving this a 6/10, mainly because of its ambition. The mythology and story stand a chance of being legitimately interesting, and the implications of the central dilemma the film sets up are kind of frightening and overwhelming.So why isn't this really good? It's tempting to blame the acting. On my most recent re-watching of a lot of the other MCU films, I was struck by the fact that often the most engaging scenes were not the action ones. Rather, the character drama is actually what I think sets those films apart and makes a lot of them good films in spite of their superficial bombast. In contrast, *none* of the personal drama is compelling, in spite of some serious attempts to pull at our heart strings. Seems natural to say that the cast simply failed at really selling this stuff. But with a cast this large, and a cast where we have some genuine talent like Barry Keoghan, does it seem likely that they'd *all* fail so badly? It's certainly possible. Maybe many of them were simply not right for their parts.Usually when this happens I tend to blame the writing, and I do think that is largely the problem here. We simply don't get enough time with these people to care about them. The other MCU films had a lot of time to set up the relationships that matter, and so the emotional stakes are generally higher. Here, we basically just met all these people.With regard to the action scenes, some of them are pretty impressive. The aesthetic of the Eternals' costume and weapon design is pretty neat, and there's an element of visual freshness here in both that design and some of the choreography. It's a shame that the dramatic glue in between those scenes really fails to hold the film together."
1176,1,"Wretched This movie definitely makes me long for Tony Stark and Cap. I was hopeful but about halfway through, this movie didn't entertain, it made me want to take a nap."
1177,1,"Eternal boredom By far the worst MCU entry and it isn't even close.I have no issues with the diversity of the cast, inthe fact I applaud it. But it still needs to be entertaining, and this is not.None of the twist in the plot are even remotely surprising or good.I truly cannot believe this was the best draft that could be put forth.The fourth phase has truly lacked the clever nature of the previous phases."
1178,8,"Eat your Brocolli MCU stans are used to a diet of popcorn, candy and soda. So when they finally get some brocolli in their company restricted diet plan they spit it out in disgust. How dare it have nutrients! What is all this... vitamins? Iron? Who needs that. Not my body. Doesn't matter if you put it in a well made dish with a lavish, creamy sauce and a multitude of other ingredients to enhance the flavour, the reaction is the same ""ugh brocolli. Worst food ever!""Eternals has almost everything the MCU has been lacking. I can't really blame MCU stans who have been living in a cave staring at shadows. Yeah, I'm mixing my metaphors, got with it. Those shadows are entertaining. Even in reality they can recognise similarities to the shadows - good guys, bad guys, superpowers, lives at stake, conflict, build up to a big fight - but the newer details, the depth and complexity to reality has them staggered and distracted. Maybe if they spent more time outside their cave they might learn to appreciate the brocolli.Personally I loved the refreshing elements here. There is no real good guy or bad guy. Even the characters I wanted to hate, I couldn't because they had totally fleshed out, believable reasons for acting the way they did, and I don't just mean I understood them, I empathised with them. The good guys have done some terrible things. The bad guys have done some great things. There just different life forms doing what they want or have been told to do. That adds so much more complexity to the ideas and decisions that the characters find themselves embroiled in.Add to that the fact that Eternals has a fantastically diverse cast: ethnic minorities, disabled, LGBTQ are clearly represented and the film does fight scenes better than most other modern movies to date purely because you can follow the CGI heavy action clearly.Thoroughly enjoyable and rewatchable for it's complex themes. Eternals is the most rich and artistic MCU film to date and definitely one of it's best."
1179,8,"Really freakin good! The critics are wrong on this one, this show is really good. It's mature, dark, and gritty. It also has some really amazing action sequences. I highly advise people to watch this and go see how good it is for themselves!"
1180,5,"What was the point? Sure, it was reasonably well made... but man, what was the point? It's not really new territory as far as concepts go. Seems like a ""connector"" movie that's going to bridge the gap in a bigger story. The casual use of classic rock makes me think it will double back to Guardians or Thor. And the mid-credits 'reveal' made me want to burn my eyes out of my head. Also, I may be mistaken, but I thought Angelina Jolie was an actor- not a mannequin. She was under-served in this film. Not sure why they wasted the budget for her role. Anyone could have pulled off what they gave her. Her 4 lines of dialogue land flat. Watch this because you need to. It's part of the whole MCU. But don't bother pausing for bathroom breaks. You won't miss much. Maybe even skip to the last 30 minutes."
1181,1,Bollywood ruined the movie Having Bollywood in a Marvel movie just ruins the movie. It doesn't make sense.Too much Bollywood doesn't improve the story at all just cheapens the whole production. Doesn't feel like a Marvel film at all.
1182,1,"awful perversion of the original comic books AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL movie script, read and re-read the Eternals comics and i feel BETRAYED by Marvel. THIS is the last Marvel movie I'll ever watch! I wish I could unwatch it. Do yourself a favor and skip this piece of awful storytelling. Utter destruction of the original story. Could've been so much more but chose to be utterly forgettable."
1183,1,Big fail! To be brief.. I guess Marvel has lost its mind!This movie is the worst product has been made by Marvel!!If I can suggest.. don't waste 150 minutes on that movie.
1184,1,"Horrible Waste of time, get the cliff notes if you're following phase 4. I'd rather watch Captain Marvel. The story could be told in 45 minutes but drones on for 2 and half hours. There's nothing likeable about the characters, the ""imminent threat"" isn't that imminent. There's not even comic relief. In all just horribly written."
1185,3,"They spent more on actors than writers It was a slow start, and introduced a past love life, then the new love life, and you little cared for either, as neither relationship was built in front of the audience. The ""trust that this matters"" through clunky exposition doesn't hold to the Marvel standard, and stays disappointing. The MU lost focus on the thematic story telling and made disparate choices in casting, employing older established names, a pair of GOT stars, and a comedian to make a broad and dull storyline available to the one person in a friend group that would drag others to the box-office.Disappointing. If it contains an ounce of importance in future stories, I recommend the after credits alone aa a better watch."
1186,6,"It is a good movie I guess, just not entertaining It is an OK movie, but it felt very slow and long. It is not helped by the lead of the movie - Gemma Chan. She seems like a good actress and I enjoyed some of the movies she was in - e.g., Crazy Rich Asians. It is just that she seems to have this facial expression and it is just depressing; making me feel movie is sadder, slower and longer."
1187,7,"Avengers this ain't Avengers this ain't...and to an extent that sums up both the drawbacks and successes of this movie. Avengers relied on scores of set-up movies to introduce characters and meandering, lengthy buddy capers for the team-up storylines. By the end(game), they couldn't continue in the same vein any longer. Eternals has a different approach. Slower, more meaningful dialogue and richer world building. It's an enjoyable journey is many ways, bogged down by a constants tension between heavy mythology and comedy one liners, the latter betraying the meddling hands of studio execs and too many script passes. I hope they make another one, in this format there are questions to pursue. A welcome relief from a 9-movie lead up to another over-edited destruction of downtown Manhattan. Treat your audience with the unibrain they have, MCU!"
1188,1,Dark picture You have to watch this movie in a cave with no light to see what is going on most of the time. We had to adjust our TV to make it brighter. Unfortunately it didn't help the movie get better. Story stinks and choice of actors is suspect.
1189,2,"A gift to Warner Bros and the DCU. I feel for the folk who paid to watch this. Basically a two and half hour united colours of Benetton advert. It's taken an obscure Kirby run and made it into something so irrelevant to the rest of the MCU it's unrecognisable. The plot,script and tone are juvenile, but the actors and effects must have cost a fortune. An absolute waste of talent and money. The worst thing was at the very end of the credits it said 'the Eternals will return'....no thanks."
1190,4,"So excruciatingly boring. I don't dislike the idea of the story, it was just so poorly executed and had me feeling absolutely nothing for any of the characters.I'm not sure if it's the actors, poor writing, the director or a combination of all of them. But it was truly a slog to get through the film I actually took a break and forced myself to come back and finish it.Things really aren't looking good for the MCU if this is the future."
1191,1,"it's so boring Save yourself the time by not watching Marvel's most boring movie, how this movie is nominated for 7 awards is beyond me as it only qualifies for the worlds most boring superhero movie, why is everything Bollywood crap no one but that nasty part of the world are the only useless people to watch this boring movie, honestly if they got rid of Bollywood from both the world and this movie is would be great but it can't since Bollywood made it."
1192,1,"So Boring The worst movie I've watched in a decade. Ewww watching Eternals was a torture.The premiss here is quite fun - 7,000 years ago a diverse race of immortals arrive on Earth to protect the population from a monstrous race of ""Deviants"" who are bent on eating us all up. Their ""Prime Directive"", if you will, is that they must not interfere in human conflict, so once they have cleared away the beasties, they split up and lead separate lives. That is, until ""Sersi"" (Gemma Chan), her pal ""Sprite"" (Lia McHugh) and her beau ""Dane"" (Kit Harrington) are set upon in London by a newly empowered creature only to be rescued by ""Ikaris"" (Richard Madden) - and that incident forces them all to reassemble. Pretty soon they discover the b."
1193,8,"Something different, always difficult to adapt When I saw different trailers, I wasn't positive because this was totally different from the other marvel movies.When I saw the movie itself, I must say it was easier to adapt to all differences. The story was not too complex but the whole setting and charater play made it well thought.I don't understand its low score. The movie had - unlike more recent marvel movies - a constant pace."
1194,6,Fine but wayy too much for one movie This movie had fun action scenes and it was a good watch. But it felt so overpacked the whole time. I could make 3 movies out of all of that. The early death of Ajak felt so dry. Sometimes you think why didn't you do this why didn't you do that. With the budget the film had I was expecting more. The movie just felt like a massive speedrun. Sometimes the characters felt fun and sometimes really dry.
1195,3,"Just not movie material Mini series yes, movie no. This looks, feels and is scripted like a mini series, including dodgy green screen effects. The only question is, was it pitched as a mini series and instead created as a movie, or a movie created by people experienced in only marking mini series. It's well over 2.5 hours, the pacing is tedious, with one basic storyline. It's all about the characters but there is no reason to invest in any of them. It's just a boring watch. And the reason it would have worked better as a mini series? You could stop watching it after episode 1."
1196,2,"Definitely my #1 Worst Movie of the Year! Ok but how are they speaking english since they are before the time when english language was spoken? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The amount of plot holes and wasted potential was really annoying and Sersei had 0 personality. The visuals were amazing but it doesn't make up for the lack of logic put into the movie. The powers were so inconsistent and the prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up a fight. The deviants were wasted as well and the celestials not telling the eternals why they're on the planet made no sense. Just so many reasons to dislike the execution of the movie. This was a lame movie, there is always a useless hero in every show and Thena was this movies useless hero... How tf you let your man die right in front of you. Thanos IS a Deviant-Eternal. So where's the logic. This movie was completely overrated i'm sorry. This film was the worst mcu film. So boring and the plot was all over the place."
1197,4,"Cheesy and no real ending Awfully cheesy the first opening 7 minutes... as it progresses there's no connection between the characters, no emotion. It's the kind of movie 🎬 you can scroll through fb as you're watching it and not really miss much.CGI is hit and miss. The ending is disappointing, massive anticlimax. And to make it even worse, right at the end there's a cameo from Harry Styles! That's a boycott for me for the sequel."
1198,6,"Almost Godly Eternals bites off a LOT - and it's fun to watch, but misses some of the magic you're accustomed to with Marvel movies. I thought Jolie would be a fun addition, but she seems like a caricature of herself. It's allllmost an epic film."
1199,4,"Eternally don't comeback Probably the worst Marvel movie in recent memory. It wasn't that the movie was bad, for me it had no place in Marvel cinematic universe. Each Eternal has powers seen in other better characters so therefore I am not able to connect with them, the characters were shoddy, soulless.I think the actors try to do what they could with their characters (apart from Angelina Jolie and Mr Madden who were awful) but it just didn't work.Please do not make a sequel, once is enough."
1200,1,"Another Story written by children How do these films get made? The dialog, the interactions, their backstory, their powers, what utter trash... all star cast with the story writing of an 8 year old."
1201,2,"Easily one of the worst movies I've seen this year tbh I am not really impressed this Eternals movie .. looks like amature superpower. Boring fight scenes & not really advantures . Well, overall it still can be watch to the end of this movie . 4/10. This film is actually not fiction at all. Worst film ever it's unbelievably terrible. Im shocked how marvel made this crap, bad acting and even worse story line . Powers are as if a school kid thought them up. Pissed !!! Do not waste your money buying it. That was the most boring Marvel movie ive ever watched! The entire movie is huge plot hole. So Celestials need to seed intelligent life to birth their kind but stood by somehow as Thanos wiped out half of life, then came back to completely wipe out the other half and all of existence? I really want to like this movie but it just didn't really work for me. Really feel like this needed to be a miniseries or spread out across multiple movies. Just too much stuff crammed into a 2 hour period. Didn't give me enough time to care about the characters/story that much, and the wonky pacing and acting didn't help with that either. I don't hate the movie, but could've been so much better."
1202,7,"Am I wrong? Is it just me or is this whole movie about an very, very, late abortion on an extrateresstial baby?Anyway, this movie is not as bad as I thought. A new look, good special-effects and styles and a story that makes the Marvelverse bigger. Sure it could've been a lot braver but I guess it's a problem that most Movies have when they try to introduce new characters and/or heroes."
1203,1,"Bad movie full of bad messages This movie felt nothing like part of Marvel universe. More like Power Rangers. I hope for sake of Marvel Universe the Etherals will keep not involving in next movies. Movie is full of bad messages. I can actually understand why would someone create racial diversity as artificial perfect beings to better infiltrate (despite fact at begin of human race there werent so many racial diverse), but I cant understand that someone can create perfect artificial being with being unable to talk. I understand this is to support people with this problems, but this is killing the plot and whole sense of the movie. Next we have underage child romance. Something that should never be touched. Then we have this ""Humanity is bad and should be judged"" ideology that is so wrong. Its like media is so much trying to convince us we are bad. Feels like excuse for oppression that we all feel today. Its wrong. People are good. Its media that wants them bad. One thing that also pushed me away is that Angelina played neurotic and unstable person. I dont think, taking everything that happened in her life, it was good idea, for Angelina image, to take this part. There is one part in the end, where Kit Harrington say ""No thanks, Im not for that"". That sentence should be meme for this movie."
1204,8,"Who the **** said that, this movie is not good enough. A brilliant, spectacular and amazing movie.Filled with thrill, Emotion, Suspense, Amazing visual effects and action.It's a perfect Marvel movie !!!!!"
1205,4,"Not so good! Seems like a one-time watch movie, a bit entertaining that's it. And some visual effects.Build-up of story is not that great. Characterizations, script, actions, dialogues are so so. Could have been better. Characters were not portrayed well. Better expected from Marvel."
1206,8,"Different direction for the MCU Despite being a huge comic book fan, the MCU formula has become predictable with the overuse of CGI, re-using the same clichés and tropes, and forced jokes. However, there have been many good Marvel movies (No Way Home being one of them), and Eternals feels different.For some the pacing could be appalling and slow, since there are many scenes where the main characters just talk, but there's a lot of character development in order to understand who these cosmic beings are.Eternals as far as I know are not as known as Spider-Man or Iron Man, and I was surprised Marvel Studios decided to make a movie about them, but I'm happy they did.Chloé Zhao's hand was very noticeable and I really liked the film, despite some flaws (some bad CGI, for example or why they weren't present in previous films). And I felt invested in the characters and the story.All in all, I prefer this kind of film than the tired tropes the MCU created and continued to use over the past decade or so.Recommended."
1207,1,"Story is NONSENSE At first it seemed to my logical story but later it turned out to be tv soap drama.Adding on to the top songs and bollywood dances. What is it action scifi or typical bollywood movie with no sense. I am having headache.Even the adult scenes were forcefully added,they were not required."
1208,6,Average A very different pace from the norm from a Marvel movie. It is neither bad nor good it is just average perhaps the series will mature over time but glad it was on Disney plus and I didn't have to sit through it at the flicks.
1209,2,"Good effects, but that's all I really tried to watch It, but couldn't make It more than half hour. It's so, SO boring.Has an inclusive cast, wich is the most useless thing a movie can haver."
1210,7,"You know nothing Jon Snow Well If you ignore other MCU This is a 7/10 movie. But if you watch other MCU movies and start questioning the logic and connection between with this movie, well good luck with that."
1211,6,"A very mixed bag! Enternals is proof that the MCU isn't always good but is always watchable.The film itself isn't bad, it has plenty of action and comic relief as we expect with the MCU.The plot is a obvious save the world job and so it should be, we have a moral divide and thought provoking villain/villains and I liked that!The problem really comes from the back story/character development 10 Eternals send to Earth 7000 years ago to fight the evil preventing human civilization from flourishing (I watched this last night I think I remember maybe 5 names) and that's part of the problem.We are introduced to the Eternals they day they land and have several cut scenes showing the battles won ( with very little to no character backstory or development) then it just cuts to modern day we learn almost nothing about them why they choose the path they did when they go separate ways..very wishy washy then all of a sudden boom.bad guy...fights internally (with the family) win war against bad guy end credit scenes.. Nothing wrong with the casting the quality of acting even the plot really it's just you can't get invested in a character without knowing them.Maybe make it a 3hr film spend time getting to knwlow them first... Or as a friend suggested so brilliantly when I was trying to think of how they could fit this all in without making it 3hrs long......should have been a series instead! Nailed it."
1212,10,"Answer to God. I will judge humanity when I return according to your memories Well, we are all doomed and lost, because throughout history the human being has been and will continue to be aggressive by nature. So the days are numbered ...A great movie with a good script and a great storytelling."

1214,5,"Better than the reviews I had pretty low expectations and it was ok. I was only really familiar with Terri of the characters in the film and I thought they were respectful of the source material. Although one of them gets a brief scene at the end, but I buy him as Starfox. Barry Keoghan really plays it in a way that kept me dubious of his intentions. Well played."
1215,6,"Missed Opportunity What a missed opportunity by Marvel, with this one. A waste of an amazing cast. Chloe Zhao completely missed the mark. Even though Zhao is an amazing talent, it is very apparent she had no idea how to translate a comic book into a movie. Just flat empty characters. It's crazy to think that, besides Phastos, a Deviant had the most compelling motives."
1216,5,"Boring Found the movie boring, acting was not so good, story was poor and slow paced. I don't understand why they chose Chloé Zhao for a Marvel movie that's like asking Tobe Hooper to make the sequel to Brokeback Mountain. Also am I the only one that felt the movie started wrong with the accents? How do beings not from earth have a South-American Hispanic- a Scottish-, an Irish- and American-accent before the start of human/earth civilization. That alone was a no go for me how can you not pay attention to a detail that obvious. I'm not even gonna start with the sign language apparently that's universal and existed far beyond time and space. While watching the movie with the celestial beings as a theme I realized again how much I love 'Final Space' If you don't mind cartoons go watch that instead!"
1217,1,"Best comic movie of the last decade I know it might look weird but the movie made me laugh so much.Angelina Jolie with those facial expression, the Indian guy is too funny to watch it looks so clumpsy on that suit, he reminds me of those bollywood movie I love to watch.The Korean guy looks like he is quite involved in the earth food while the black guy.....""Babylon 575 BC""...the guy speaks with a strong American accent that has not even been invented.Too Funny.Thanks."
1218,10,"Far better than the critics said. Such an amazing movie this was. I don't know just because of a sexual scence people hated this movie. I really enjoyed the story line and the cinematic scence my god, even the celestial theme and loved all the characters and cast. This movie is at least 7.5 rated but because of some dumbass people have given it 6.7. I felt very bad about, this movie is very good. Eagerly waiting for the sequel."
1219,1,"Does not even deserve a one star rating This movie was to worried about focusing on its LGBTQ+ representation and not on plot or viewer enjoyment.The movie was nothing close to any past marvel project and does not even deserve a one-star rating.I would not recommend this movie to anyone, or ever consider the idea to view this rubbish again."
1220,5,"Meh. This is the most DC movie Marvel has ever made.Trite characters, generic dialog and a plot. That. Just. Keeps. Dragging. On.Everyone looked like they were acting through a screen they were watching behind the camera.Watch this movie, so that you have a baseline to judge good ones against."
1221,4,"Bad acting, bad script. It's like looking at a parody for superhero movies... Hit on every cliches, bad acting,bad script, very long movie.Save your precious time. You better watch a paint drying slowly....."
1222,1,Shazam! Story seems like Marvel version of Shazam!I did not expect a low quality story line from Marvel. They need to be little bit more careful with their scripts!And This Celestial - EGO! Same story!
1223,2,Unsure Just watched it. I really don't know what's happening. Might watch it again as I feel it's crazy how much I don't understand about the story or maybe there wasn't one?! But Gemma and Richard was great enough.
1224,1,Man...whats wrong with Hollywood What mediocre movie... waste of money... the characters don't even match with the original comic book... Move on... it will be forgotten in a month....
1225,7,"Great special effects, but a weak story As a Marvel fan I had high expectations. Unfortunately I got disappointed. Let me be honest, the special effects were marvelous, but that was about it. The story was very messy.It started 5000BC in Mesopotamia. That's fine, but when they just appeared, the people there were not even surprised. I'd think that when people see a flying object for the first time and flying people, they freak out and start running. But nothing happens.And more of that during the movie.No. As said before, the effects are wonderful, but the story is weak. So the seven stars is for the effects."
1226,2,"It's very boring This movie not in the standards MCU levels.its very boring movie. Eternals"" is not your typical MCU film. It's definitely something out of the Marvel norm. Darker and more mature, but without losing the lighter moments that maintain the Marvel magic. Visual are good."
1227,1,Very very bad I think that Angelina Jolie wasted her time because it is very bad movie and it was a very long movie ... It was 150 minutes and it is a bad dialogue when I watched this movie I disappointed.
1228,2,"Worst Marvel movie by far I am a huge Marvel fan, but this is something else.It feels choppy with an unusual amount of bad acting.Seeing John Snow interacting with Robb Stark and and competing about a woman called Cersei is straight up weird.And I honestly have no idea what's going on and howt all this is relevant to the MCU.Fast forwarded to the post credit scenes after 50 minutes."
1229,6,"Cuts This movie might set the record for most scene cuts in cinematic history. I mean it feels like every scene is a montage, making it so fast and hard to see any actual acting in the movie other than the pandering shots. For a 2.5 hour movie, it feels unbelievably rushed. Easy to follow and fun to watch but not memorable because it's so distracting how each scene is shot.I.e. Kit harringtons first kiss with his eternal girlfriend literally took multiple cuts. It's like the editor was on 100mg of adderall and thought he could make each scene perfect by cutting it up so much for the ""best"" shots."
1230,1,Please trust the bad reviews. The movie made me so bored that i wanted to leave the theater. This could be the worst movie of MCU. The most terrible part of movie its runtime. It feels like a eternity while watching this movie. Please go with the negative reviews and save your time. Not recommend at all.
1231,10,"One of the best Marvel Movies to Date I have no clue why there are so much negative reviews. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, ever. The visuals, the casting choices, the performances, the storylines. All Amazing."
1232,2,"A Marvel first, so boring I stopped watching So poorly paced, trying to fit so much exposition, character introduction and development when it got the third CGI punch fest I was so bored I turned it off."
1233,7,"Fantastic!!! Fantastic 🤘 Another beginning of a great journey for Marvel. Good story, great cast, great effects. Visual masterpiece. Loved it. A must watch for Marvel fans."
1234,1,"DUMPSTER FODDER Let me begin by saying, I received an email from Disney+ where the tag line is ""We waited 7000 Years for the Eternals. After watching this trash, maybe they should have waited 7000 more years. This is a typical Marvel Movie, where the main characters spend more time fighting among themselves than they do the bad guys (Deviants) in this movie. This isn't a spoiler, just an acute observations. The weapons the Eternals use are weak and ineffective, one shoots lights out of eyes, rather than lasers, that lone would have solved the Deviant crisis they encountered.This movie makes entirely no sense, their quest is idiotic, and this jumping from one time to another only adds to make the movie confusing. If I had watched this in s theater I would be demanding my money back and suing the movie theater for not providing for my entertainment pleasure.There are however elements of Disney and Star Wars peppered throughout the movie, that doesn't help, Watch this at your own risk, then ask for a refund on your ticket. Disney/Marvel FAILED again, the MCU is left lacking."
1235,2,"Doesn't even feel like a marvel film. Very poor. This is a very bad film. Lacked on every aspect. What kept going through my mind, this is a very long film! I couldn't wait for it to end. The first marvel film I don't like at all. Man this film is so bad."
1236,6,"Too Many Characters, Too Much Story Eternals is a very ambitious project that ultimately gets bogged down by too many characters to focus on and too big of a story to tell. Chloe Zhao brings her trademark natural landscape cinematography and human storytelling but in effort to give every character their share of screentime, none of them really shine except Angelina Jolie's Thena. The dialogues dont have any impact, the scenes are clunky and badly edited, a lot of narrative decisions dont make sense. The action scenes are impressive and the events have big implications for the Cosmic MCU. But overall its a pretty forgettable watch."
1237,4,"Eternals was eternally long Marvel's next adaptation of comics to film, is ETERNALS. Too be kind there is enough material in this film alone for several films. But the information we were given in this script wasn't done well. Each character had to have their own storyline beginning. Then the writers had to quickly finish the the film and bring it to an end.The film is shot well, actors are on par. But if you are expecting Avengers or Guardians ETERNALS isn't on there level."
1238,5,Correct Title This movie was Eternally long. It seemed to me that the cohesion between the actors was not there. Some parts were good others not. My 10 year old who loves Marvel films left with 50 minutes left.
1239,2,Eturdnals A great cast lost among mountains of tedious exposition that was never going to make the transition from the page.The Harry Styles scene was the most excruciating screen moment since Ed Sheeran in GOT. Colossal missteps all round.
1240,2,"Boring This is the first Marvel movie that made me fall asleep.Boring plot, boring lines, boring acting.It has nothing. The most interesting element were the Deviants because ""shiny colors"" and that's about it.Enough said."
1241,1,"Well, at least there's diversity and inclusion. What a big pile of s#1t and cringe. Just awful Extremely boring.At least it's diverse and inclusive. There's that. For that reason it should make a lot of money."
1242,6,"Easily the worst marvels movie I can't imagine how it could be have been made better, just imagining with the cast and the way the story was told is just unworkable and disappointing. For it to have been better , it would have to be totally remade."
1243,5,Boring Too long.Boring characters.Hardly any humour.This is about the best way I can desceibe this movie.Ow and the mid credit scene showed some cgi of the late 80's.I hope this movie wont be an important part of the MCU.
1244,2,"Bad all over ETERNALS plays like a rough draft written by a film student who hasn't learned the basics of story structure. There's no villain for the first half of the movie. Other issues include being over-long, horrible acting from some of the cast, and clunky, on-the-nose dialog. The film isn't up to the usual high quality bar from Marvel, not even close."
1245,1,"The worst MCU movie I've ever seen! The worst MCU movie I've ever seen!Barely finished the movie! So weak, the characters and the events are not making any sense!So boring, and the whole time in the movie just to fill the time."
1246,2,"The most useless Superhero movie This is perhaps the most boring Superhero movie in the Marvel Universe with the silliest story to date!In the beginning of time, beings known as 'Celestials' tender parts of the Universe like Gardeners.When a new Celestial is born it has to grow within the core a planet like a giant egg. When it is born it breaks the planet open. When this Celestial decides to come out of the Earth's core it doesn't look very big or the scene doesn't look very epic. The Eternals are just nurses.How many miles of thick core did it break to come out? Why did the oceans not fall into the huge cracks it would have made? The seismology machines would have gone nuts? No earthquakes, no tsunamis? And if all the Superheroes on Earth hadn't sensed a mega seismic event like that (if that's what it was meant to be) then it must have been ""Superhero day off""?The Eternals movie serves no purpose in anytime line. They all have useless powers but we are made to be told that the powers they possess are beyond imagination?They are meant to be Eternal but can be killed like any ordinary person.They are sent to Earth 7000 years earlier for a mission but will not be told until the time is right. They are told to mingle amongst the locals and integrate.I am assuming that when they marry only the loved ones know their secret but anyone else close to them, Aunts, Uncles, Cousins, etc, must be dim-witted not to know that one of them is not aging?The Bollywood dance sequence is a complete laugh and if that were a real Bollywood movie dance I can assure you that punters would demand their money back!!The creatures they fight don't look at all frightening and the Eternals keep getting beat by them.It also becomes a murder mystery?The fight at the end of the movie really is terrible using hand gestures you might think they were trying to teach you to cook.Don't waste two hours of your time watching this awful movie."
1247,2,"Enternals I really, really love Marvel movies, but that Eternal is a totally disaster, it's sucks. Hollywood is to much involved, what is going on outside the movies. I turned it halfway off. I am really disappointed from that movie."
1248,2,"Another empty shell. Just the same old superheroes but with a different skin, there is no story here. I don't even know what to say about it. It's all so predictable and boring."
1249,4,"Possibly the worst MCU movie yet There were some interesting choices made in the production of this movie. First, much of the runtime was devoted to flashbacks that, for me, did little to flesh out the characters of the Eternals and merely lengthened an already baggy film.Secondly, the decision to criminally under-use both Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie; I can only assume they were being paid by the line and the movie ran over budget. There's an element of stunt casting at play in adding such actors to the roster (as is also the case with the last Eternal revealed), which becomes more obvious when you don't use them to their potential.Then there is the choice of Gemma Chan and Richard Madden as de facto leads. Whether it's the lacklustre script, or a failure to project charisma, neither of their characters felt anything more than two-dimensional.Then there's the plot. The underlying reason for the Eternals being on Earth makes no sense. This is a convoluted Bond-villain plan writ large. Simpler, faster solutions exist - like seeding a planet that already has a large population. Equally, the explanation for not fighting Thanos, whose actions could have significantly delayed ""the emergence"" if not for the Avengers resetting the ""snap"", is basically, ""Sorry, we only fight Deviants"".It may be that this movie serves as the set-up to a whole new branch of MCU movies, but on the basis of this film, I have little in the way of excitement to watch them."
1250,5,Good cure for insomnia Too long. Too many script plot points to follow when the film itself is sending you to sleep. Not brilliant tbh. Acting isn't the best. Effects quite good. A bit boring. Worth a miss.
1251,9,"An amazing film! (Doesn't have spoilers) This movie was incredible! The story is fantastic! It was so different then any marvel film I've seen. I don't understand why people hated the movie?! There was so much dialogue, and story between every character! The actors did a great job! This movie brings everything I love about the mcu, space, the jokes, the action and visual effects!(Spoiler ALERT) The one problem I have, is the deviants. We found that they have an intelligence, but then Thena just slices the deviant in 10 pieces!"
1252,6,"Enjoyable, but it's definitely one of Marvel's worst movies This is not a bad movie at all. The premise is interesting and the visuals are stunning, but it doesn't offer much more than that. The acting is mediocre at best (not because of the actors themselves, but because of their poorly written lines and interactions), and there are so many characters to introduce that it feels like the plot doesn't advance at all until the last 20 minutes; and for a 2.30 hs movie, that says a lot.The one thing I loved was, as always, the post credits scene, since it opens the door to a side of marvel that I would have never expected to see on films, so I'm pretty hyped about that.Overall I found it entertaining, but it's definitely on my top 3 of worst Marvel movies so far."
1253,8,"Pleasantly surprised... Despite my love of most of what Marvel has done, really wasn't expecting a great deal here, having been left cold by the books some years ago. So it was indeed a pleasant surprise to find I enjoyed this.The for me bland characters from the 'comics' have been fleshed out and become much more interesting. And given the number of characters involved, I was expecting many to be sidelined, but each one had enough time for you to get to know/understand them. Then add a good storyline, the usual massively impressive settings that Marvel do so well, heart, a little humour and obviously action, all in all I came away thinking, ok not the best MCU film, but certainly not the worst, and definitely worth a watch. Actually two watches.I'll be very happy to see them again, mixing in with established characters - the interraction should be fun - carry on Mr Feige, you're continuing to oversee something special, even with much lesser known characters. Credit to all involved, super craftsmanship as expected, and a fine cast, certainly not wasted....."
1254,10,"A less appreciated and yet more mature MCU movie And to think I almost didn't watch this because of all the bad reviews which for the life of me, I can't figure out where they come from and why. For once, the MCU universe gives us a film that isn't filled wall to wall with cynicism and sarcasm. Instead it gives us a beautiful story of misplaced loyalty and compassion. And it is absolutely visually stunning. Don't believe the hate. Its completely uncalled for in this case."
1255,8,"Good start for new journey... Many people give bad ratings to this movie even before the announcement of release date & I feel rally sad to see that. Frankly speaking this was a good movie. Don't expect that it would brake the records of movies like Avengers but it would definitely starting new journey of Marvel in something new direction. And believe me guys the ending of this journey is as good as Avengers End Game. Just wait for it and have a little patience you won't disappoint with the end result. So, just give it a chance and watch the movie if you haven't watched it yet."
1256,7,"If you look hard enough, there's definitely a good film in there somewhere Emotional element needed more work. Humour didn't do it for me. That said, this movie is quite thought provoking.""Would you kill thousands to save a billion which could kill billions more?""I just wish they had a fewer characters and different approach to the first half.After Endgame, I think this is the only movie I will remember for being 'not that bad'. Nowadays that's saying something about MCU."
1257,8,"Visually Stunning I don't understand the bad reviews and bad press this movie got before it even came out. I finally got to watch it and can say it actually was a very good movie. It's not your typical Marvel movie, which I found refreshing. First off, it's visually stunning. I read that the director used visually pleasant filming locations rather than rely on green screen production and I can say that was a great idea. Besides having great cinematography, the actors all had great chemistry. The movie was heartwarming, had just enough action and a few comedic moments that were placed well. The story itself was very easy to follow and gave us just enough background to know who these characters were and why they are important. Yes, I admit it was a long movie, but there is not much you could cut out without ruining the story. I honestly feel bad for Zhao, the director, because she did an amazing job. Hardcore Marvel movie fans are giving this movie bad reviews because I guess they are used to the terrible drivel we get nowadays with all these superhero movies. This movie had a great storyline and was very heartwarming, something a lot of Marvel movies are not good at. This movie is different which is great. A breath of fresh air and I applaud the director's vision. I would like to see more Marvel, and even DC, movies made like this. Such a bummer this movie and the director got so much flack. It was such a well made movie and is now in my top 5 favorite Marvel movies."
1258,3,"Marvel screw up. Dull, cynical and boring Marvel have gone down the DC road with this..... namely, introduce a ton of characters with no back story and hope that we care about them.It's just a bunch of stuff that happens with no dramatic build up or understanding of to to make characters believable.ITS way too long. Chaos Zhou is in over her head with this. The colour palate used by the cinematographer is dull and boring. GEMMA Chan is a personality vacuum and they bring in Harry Styles at the end to get the young girls interested in the next one."
1259,1,"Thank you for wasting my Time ! Boring and procrastinating good beginning, bad middle part and even worse ending. The film is far too long for the little story that is in it.Eternals don't come back please !"
1260,4,"Much of the same... Unremarkable heroes with unremarkable powers in an unremarkable storyline. The Eternals and the Deviants were never very interesting in the comics, and Marvel have stayed true to that at least, but bringing them to the MCU film franchise really does show that Marvel peaked with End Game and Disney are now slowly, excruciatingly trying to replicate that success with a series of numbing films which will no doubt work it's way, after much the same of year upon year mediocrity, to some kind of all inclusive finale.Unfortunately, I'm not prepared to sit through another 20 years of that, not with my previous blind dedication at least...The one bright spark: the introduction of Kit Harrington as Dane Whitman. Although this was not his movie, his introduction hopefully means not all future movies will be as banal as this one."
1261,1,"another load Another load of bollocks from the Marvel Universe. You'd think with them going 'off piste' a little it might generate a good storyline .. no chance. Time this ""superhero ""genre was laid to rest."
1262,8,Must watch for Marvel fans Great movie! I think mostly Marvel and comic book fans would appreciate this one.If you have not seen the previous Marvel movies then don't bother watching this until you do as alot of the plot and extended storie lines would be lost plus all the subtle easter eggs and 2 end credit scenes.
1263,2,"Predictable, over-hyped, scriptless Painful. Half way through my family began ripping this apart sarcastically. Big actor names disappointingly add little gravitas to a barely scripted waffle. It felt like a retirement payday for some of the older actors and I was amazed to see a promised sequel at the end of the movie after a terrible storyline.MCU /Disney really need to get their act together here, as yet again another churned out production. Churned milk has a satisfying product at the end anyway! Seriously, what's up with the script writers in this company, two predictable plot twists a 4 year old can see at least 20 minutes before arriving.In its entirety over reaching, over ambitious and under rewarding."
1264,5,"Too boring! Tried fusion with Bollywood but failed. Nothing new this time, same old concept of killing predators, looks like mixture of fantastic four flash super man. Too boring to watch. Too lengthy streched plot makes it more worse!"
1265,9,"A Marvel movie.... not for everyone. I can speak for this movie for hours, but my time is limited and precious.First of all.. I'm not a Marvel fanboy.I watch every single movie for what it is.Well.. Eternals for me was a big surprise and I mean BIG!I sat down and watched it with no expectations and no true desire... And oh boy what a movie this is!!!!Perfect casting, great cinematography and most of all excellent script.And the action scenes were great, with incredible visuals.I can't wait to rewatch it!"
1266,7,"Not too bad, not too good, just a fresh start for eternals Before it had a chance to be shown to audiences around the world, Eternals (2021) received a ton of negative reviews from critics and audiences alike. No longer colorful like other MCU movies, no longer simple and entertaining, Chloe Zhao's Eternals (2021) brings a whole new breath to the MCU.Eternals (2021) brings many powerful and immortal characters but all that the characters show is too faint compared to the length of the film. The fact that Chloe Zhao brings fates, situations or circumstances to the character can completely contradict the audience, creating uncomfortable feelings. 2h36m is quite a long time compared to a movie that can be said to be quite flat, if Marvel decides to bring a tv series, it will be a lot more suitable.With a pretty good plot, but what Chloe Zhao shows it is to create too many conflicts between the characters, making the film become ""more dialogue"" and less ""superhero"". That is why the Eternals performed quite superficially, with few highlights, but the character Makkari is really a bright spot of the film, although there is not much acting space, but each frame that appears this character provide an enjoyable and beautiful experience.If you like Chloe Zhao and the movies she made, you'll have a little interest in Eternals (2021). Limiting CGI as much as possible, Chloe Zhao brings to the MCU the visual art that no previous MCU film can do, which is the immense scenery of nature and people immersing in it. The authenticity, rustic in those footage is something you won't be able to find in previous MCU movies. Unlike the backgrounds full of CGI buildings, Eternals makes a huge difference, but that's why there are quite a few movie scenes that are out of tune when trying to harmonize between the actual scene and the CGI. The lighting in the movie is also very well optimized compared to previous MCU movies, perhaps partly because of the actual use of light, so many different segments and lights are shown very wellEternals is not a bad movie but it's not too good for everyone to enjoy, maybe many people don't like it now but maybe later the movie can win the hearts of viewers. Like a ticking time bomb, Eternals (2021) didn't reach the audience's satisfaction, but it was definitely a premise for the MCU's Eternals to explode later."
1267,7,"VERY DIFFERENT ""Eternals"" is an admirable film for creating a story that is different from the rest of the MCU, but major flaws like a too many characters, predictable twist, flashbacks that (mostly) feel like deleted scenes and the acting from Druig's actor keep it from reaching its full potential. Overall, the end result is mostly good."
1268,10,"An artistic variation of the ""MCU formula"" Let's be honest. The MCU formula of comedy action superhero movies works but it is getting old and a bit boring. Like in the comic industry, not every movie should have the same artwork, but Marvel should try to differentiate its ""movie artstyle"" a it has done so with the ""comic art styles"" in the last decades.The current ""MCU house style"" is very successful, but when you are at the height of your success, you should thry to evolve into something new and fresh again. This happens when a revolutionary new artistic team (writer & artists) take over a comic magazine. Like Frank Miller with Daredevil or Batman in the 1980s.So here is Chloé Zhao with her take on the Marvel MCU and yes, she tries a new approach with a more ""honest"" approach to portraying characters. She takes the gods/eternals serious and not as a comedy tool.And also her art style is different with these fine golden lines of energy and views of cinematic landscape and non-western people.I congratulate her for her courage and Kevin Feige for allowing this project to stay away from the MCU formula most of the times."
1269,2,"Not 1/10 only because I love Marvel As I said 2/10 only because it's Marvel. Horrible in every way in my opinion. Well enough said I never rated any Marvel movie below 6/10. So happy did not spend my money going to cinema and spending 2,5 hrs there."
1270,2,"Worst Marvel film to date. Wow, this was beyond horrible. All these great actors and yet completely wooden performances. The director seemed to be more interested in locations than actual performances. Special Effects won't save this disaster."
1271,1,"New reigning champion of the worst MCU films This movie came right out of left field, to steal the title of worst film from black widow, to be the new worst MCU movie. This movie made no sense to the MCU and it's characters are just as boring as the film itself. Hopefully we are done with the eternals. This was bad, very bad. Avoid if you can."
1272,10,Critics Are you crazy or something? It's a very unique and entertaining movie. I love the character development of each character in this movie. The director gave space for each character that I loved to watch. Go watch it and the movie doesn't disappoint you.
1273,2,"I use up all my motivation and still couldn't finish it It's just very very boring without any likeable characters. Richard Madden is more wooden than the frame of the guillotine that cut off ned starks head, they seem to have shoehorned in a deaf superhero, a gay black superhero and a Bollywood movie star superhero, it's all just a bit weird and a massive sideshow covering up the fact the film is just really dull and uninteresting."
1274,1,Worst Marvel Movie Ever This movie is so bad that it forces me to open an account here to give it 1 star.Kudos to the makers who worked tirelessly to make this the worst marvel movie ever. Good job 👌👌👌
1275,10,"Not your typical Marvel Movie This movie brings a different perspective of history and culture to the MCU which we've seen in other movies but what makes this movie stand out is it's magnificent introduction of these heroes, there powers and Relationship in correlation with how these heroes had an in pact on the history we know and love."
1276,1,"Nearly a great movie If it wasn't for the 2 men kissing in this movie, it could have been a great movie. Why do they need to include unnatural relations that are encouraged by demons?"
1277,6,"Milking the same cow over and over again I had to force myself to watch this movie as the trailer did not predict a good one. Not often is the trailer representative but here it was. It´s really the same old over and over again. I get it, Marvel, a household name. But it shouldn't be that difficult to come up with something more original? The ridiculous costumes and even the acting of Angela Jolie and Salma Hayek was off. And I prefer to see Kumail Nanjiani in comic roles. But that´s just my opinion. Hope you guys enjoyed it. I didn´t."
1278,1,"Could Have Been Better! Don't get me wrong marvel is awesome ! But we all know marvel make tweaks to their mcu, I think with a little of tweaks this movie could have broken the internet. What if! The eternals had their own city, hidden but not like Wakanda the city have it's own magical powers where only the pure of heart and in need of sanctuary would see it. And what if sprite had the powers of ikaris. And what if the deviants were old eternals that defied the celestial order. I have more ! If your interested LIKE!"
1279,6,"What went wrong? Boring, disjointed, and ran for far too long given the script. It felt like it was being padded out with unnecessary flashbacks that really should have been at the beginning of the film, andside stories that didn't have substance.A really poor effort from Marvel Studios with this release.Don't get me wrong, I've been reading Marvel comics since the very early 70's, and watched all the films since Iron Man.I felt one or two of those films could have been done a little better here and there, but overall, I've enjoyed them.But this Eternal's film has left me disappointed.I'll watch it again at some point to see if perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of mind this time round.But first impressions are, they got it wrong.The 6 out of 10 rating I've given is slightly higher than I feel the story deserves, but the action (when it came) and CGI lifted it to a 6... for now."
1280,1,"Cowdung, horrible One.. of the worst Marvel movies... How can they go so wrong.. it's just pure stupid...and the plot is sooo bad.. it's like a comedy without being a comedy."
1281,3,"My mind kept nagging ""The Boys"" the entire movie Ever since the movie started and I couldn't un-notice the high resemblance between Richard Madden as Ikaris and Antony Starr as Homelander from The Boys series , the did look the same and acted the same that I could even anticipate he'll end up a bad ""Supe"" like they call them at ""The Boys"" , of course I know that the ""Eternal Comics"" go way back than ""The Boys"" but however the ""Eternals"" still did not seem like a genuine idea revolving around similar concepts once on the big screen .Also Angelina Julie and Salma Hayek were such big names and acting capabilities , their roles were mediocre and almost marginal in that movie to my disappointment , I was highly expecting good acting from these 2 where one of which was mostly CGI and the other mostly smiling like a grandmother ."
1282,7,"This New Marvel Phase Might Click I don't get the negatively surrounding this movie, I think it was very cool with the casting as well. Enjoyed this piece, a bit hackneyed in the superhero genre but not bad. Hopefully in its sequel it get darker and melancholic in its theme. The have a good thing here don't turn it lighter for the audience, you have heroes going up against the baddest in the Marvel universe so let it be serious. Thanks."
1283,1,Eternal 0/10 Why marvel why? I think eternals is worst movie of all MCU. Average casts and they stinks Story is very poor 😔. I thought black knight will be in movie but he is not. 7000 year history of eternals 👎
1284,2,"Shockingly bad Relies on its big budget CGI and other effects and its all-star cast - the writing is incredibly weak even for a Marvel film (some have been quite good actually). There are silly mistakes in the film, timeline errors and major eyeroll moments. I really suggest not wasting your time with this film. It's bad. Laugh out loud at the absurdity at least once bad."
1285,4,Not OK Obviously she doesn't know how to direct a blockbuter movie and also any who picked up this actors/actresses for this roles doesn't have a clue about roles !I mean come on what is this all about just bunch of superheroes that just do what other marvel's superheroes do ?!Literally i didn't connect with any of them evey character in eternal are so empty that everything they do is just pointless i mean you have to build-up them you have to show us what exactly they are NOT just their ramance story oh ! Yeah they lived thousand years and they suddenly living in earth don't helping humankind with thanos because they have to learn ! They have to fight ! So what the ... you doin here any way ?I know they here because the deviants but honestly don't you think that this villains (Deviants) are more fragile than the other villains avengers fought with ?! (Except Arishem ! )There's no explaination !
1286,1,Wait is this marvel movie ? Completely disappointed by the movie. Seems like a documentary. The movie is very slow and does not even feels like a superhero movie.My rating is 0/10 sadly i cant give 0 in IMDB.
1287,1,"Marvel has lost it, don't waste your time. Marvel has gone too far in their idiocracy of aliens wanting to destroy earth. I have lost track of how many alien overlords see earth as their playground or property.This movie is slow, keeps inserting flashbacks when it doesn't need them.The attempt of hijacking greek mythology is lame and shallow.And then there is the 'environmental message' that is getting to be anoying. Why is it that all movies sort of address the way we handle earth, but none really dare to name the issue?I had expected more from a movie with this cast. It seems that stars want a piece of the marvel-action, no matter how lame the script and the movie are."
1288,4,"4 stars just for Lauren Ridloff acting everything else was just a chaos This movie had everything really and litteraly everything to be a great movie, instead it was just chaos in the story time line, acting, the dialouge boring and lame, the only thing only thing put a smile on my face from this chaos just Lauren Ridloff.Marvel & hollywood didn't learn after all this time when you create a threat that will distroy the world you can make it like Loki Series or don't make it at all."
1289,5,"stupid That was a complete waste of time and a movie - it was legit about nothing. Could of all been told in like 1hr 30mins. There was some cool stuff visuals were top, gemma chan is a babe, angelina is still hot, had two lol parts, but othee than that it was paper thin."
1290,2,"Not good enough! Don't waste your time! Stupid plot, bad characters development, and almost nothing to enjoy, it should have been a show so we can really explores the Externals...."
1291,8,"Not bad at all I read a lot of reviews of this film saying that this was the worst marvel..It was the main reason I didn't watch it in the theaters. Even though its not as good as many other marvel movies,It was a pretty good movie. And Thor still remains as the worst marvel film i've watched."
1292,10,Solid Movie that will blend into the MCU storyline The movie was solid for a part 1 movie and went into further depth then most movies. The people trashing it wouldn't know a solid movie if it smacked them in the face. The Eternals are the largest group in the MCU and thus the need for more time on backstories. If you watched it and thought the deviants were the villians you clearly didn't watch the movie or you simply struggle with plots. Can't wait for the next one and the other MCU movies and shows that fill in the blanks.
1293,6,"Worst Marvel Movie so far The film in its entirety does not fit into the Marvel universe. On the one hand, he lacks the appropriate integration of his heroes into the overarching Marvel story, on the other hand, the story is slow and tiring and in its strongest sections relies more on intense feelings than quick-witted action. That's not bad, but in my opinion Marvel has no place in it. As a drama, the film can be viewed well, as a superhero film rather moderately. Worst Marvel Movie Ever."
1294,1,"ANOTHER MCU Failure! ANOTHER MCU Failure! 20 minutes in and I wanted to puke. Too cheesy, boring, needs better actors and the story makes no sense. Doesn't have the chemistry that the Avengers had. These new characters that have been introduced as of late has been floundering IMO."
1295,9,"Zero effort making in making the names All it had was just action but this time it wasn't the same like thena had fears and showed to overcome them. The whole movie was brilliant because most of it was about cultures like India there was an Indian actor , wedding , and ocean. The creature seems to be much devastating to even imagine like for real. I suppose this is the 1st MCU movie with that romance and s*x. Just have to say I can't wait for the 2nd part.MASSIVE SPOILER: harry styles will be in 2nd part and will have a huge role to actually portray. That's what which is exiting."
1296,6,"Worst MCU movie ever. This was the most unremarkable superhero movie I've seen. The writing was lazy, sloppy, clunky, convoluted, incoherent, and riddled with plot issues, especially with the dizzying and boring backstories. Aside from some decent S/VFX, there were zero ""wow"" moments. Rarely do I keep checking my watch to see how much more time I have to put up with this nonsense. Even the casting felt out of place, like anyone off the street can be made to look and act as a superhero. Jolie seemed bored. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden were the only convincing performances. Even each Eternal's superpower was lame, and confusing what exactly they can do (except Madden with his X-Men eye power). The one girl was a deaf Flash? It took four to five writers to come up with this slow-paced 156 min Eternally long and boring nonsense? What a waste of a budget. It's a 6/10 from me. Please, no part 2, and if it is a must, eliminate Chloé Zhao and the writers from the equation. Give it to Snyder."
1297,9,"It's Eye Soothing... Of course not the best MCU movie.. But definitely the most beautiful MCU movie 😍Fantastic casting, Eye soothing visuals, Epic story, Great action and Weak Screenplay."
1298,7,"So this is what an average MCU movie feels like I delayed watching the movie since the reviews weren't great and the release time didn't fit my schedule, boy I'm glad I did. I have only watched it now to catch up with the MCU because I couldn't think of anything else. Overall, the movie is just average, nothing sticks and neither is there a wow moment, and mind you it has a run time of 2+ hours. It felt like one of those movies where too many characters are crammed together and none of their arcs are truly explored. The fight scenes didn't seem that marvelous, the constant flashbacks were underwhelming, and Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek were definitely underused. At the end of the movie, I thought there'd be something more because it didn't feel like an ending, there was no climax but they decided to leave it like that.Watching Jon Snow (Kit Harington) call Gemma Chan 'Sersi' did not work for me on so many levels."
1299,5,"The worst Marvel movie Characters are all uninteresting. 7000+ years and they don't do much, they don't grow or change much or learn much.... Stuck in the same rut for 7000+ years.In 7000 years many of these characters have not learned to fight, better themselves. They often forget to use their powers.Except when it's convenient to change for the story. Like the guy who became disillusioned with humanity over those 7000 years, only to change his mind over a dude he's banging for a few years.No idea why Jon Snow was in this, more pointlessness.And if you want to save the world you better count on luck more than smarts or teamwork or heart or anything else."
1300,7,"Ok, what's next? I want to say I loved it, but I can't. Did I enjoy it? Yes! But I'm just not crazy about it.The effects were amazing, the music was great too and the fighting sequences were awesome!I wish we had more info about the Deviants, I feel like we didn't really know much about them and when we got to really see them and know what they were all about, they were gone.Maybe it's because it was a whole new thing full of characters I never even heard of, it took me sometime to see who was who and who did what.The big reveal and twist was great though, I didn't see it coming.And what was that mid-credit scene about? Huh? I didn't get it. But then again, I'm not a comic book fan, I only watch the movies and my knowledge of it all only comes from them. So I'll have to dig about that.And that other after-credits scene? Well... I don't know what to make of it yet."
1301,4,"A montage of screensavers. ""Eternals"" is really bad, isn't it? Pains me to admit it because it feels like the first truly risk taking MCU flick they've made in the franchise's history but I must concede that sadly, despite the commendable ambition of the project, none of the highs present throughout culminate to form anything substantial enough to outweigh the multitude of lows... And thus, it's a total, lacklustre disappointment.The main flaw stems from the fact that Oscar winning Chloé Zhao's direction is (somehow) genuinely appalling in this. Yes, she has remarkably inventive vision & a truly great eye for an aesthetically pleasing, naturalistic shot but as for her basic storytelling abilities? Weak. It's incoherent, poorly structured & badly paced.Of course, I'm obviously not doubting her talent. Merely making an observation that as an auteur (normally responsible for shooting indies), I don't think she was personally well suited to blockbuster filmmaking & hence, shouldn't have been involved with helming this - as it's clearly not something she's capable of adapting to / pulling off successfully.Her movie just drags. There's an insufficient amount of dialogue in the introductory sequence, very little connective tissue to bridge the gaps between set pieces & the lines that actors are given to say on screen are written atrociously & clichéd as hell. Not to mention, she fails to get particularly memorable performances out of any of her actors & makes the unfathomable mistake of including an expository CGI PowerPoint presentation with an overly long monologue to explain the plot mid way through - as if that's a satisfactory way to convey information to a viewing audience?Everything simply relies heavily on the outstanding style / gorgeous designs to compensate for the complete lack of substance. There's no denying the impressiveness of the visual quality of the filmmaking (cinematography, set design & VFX) because I can't think of a single other Marvel outing that's looked THIS unique & distinctive but regardless, that's all it has to offer. It's surface level & hollow."
1302,9,"very underated A bit refreshing for a marvel movie. I liked the loose Greek history references, as well as trying top an already deep story line. It's not really about moving the story along but thickening the possible plot lines to come."
1303,3,Disney meets DC Star Wars remake grade CGI Overpowered superheroes with confusing moral conflicts.Typical Disney style cultural insensitivies Storylines that don't make sense Side stories were supposed to care about but don't Characters we don't care about and don't want to care about Bad actors acting badly Good actors acting badlyThe only thing MCU about this movie is the nameless hordes. And that's not a compliment.
1304,10,Enjoyed it If you are looking for a fast pack action movie . This will not be your thing . Personally enjoyed the slower pace .not read any of the comics or source material so not sure how true to it it is. But having a movie that is not just one actions cent after the other was a n ie change.
1305,3,"WTF? 80% of movie was too dark to see. Ok, so let me start off and say this is for the casual viewer and not the comic aficionado.Today, Eternals came out in Disney+ and I had avoided the theaters until recently so this was first time I had a chance to view it. I got home from work made dinner and sat down to watch it on my 80 inch Samsung UHD tv. I adjusted colors to perfect settings during a viewing of Red Notice. The picture started off beautiful. Colors really popped and I was getting use to characters. Then it's like the lighting crew for the movie quit and the rest of the movie was shot in pitch black. It wasn't until final battle that I could finally see everyone again. Tv brightness was maxed out.Hollywood has done this alot over the last few years and I believe it's their way to hide imperfections in details. However the rest of the Marvel movies are excellent balance in lights and darks. Disney was so proud that they hired a recent academy award winner to direct but somehow forgot to hire a crew to support her. I have a hard time believing that this is the film she intended to make.Story was competent, casting was amazing and diverse, action was great when you can see what's going on. You can also tell this wasn't shot on a studio and that they really went to the locations to shoot. All of this should have made a decent marvel film. It didn't. I am disappointed with film and if I hadn't just seen Spideman I would be worried for Marvel.Disney please take note. Make your movies so they can be enjoyed on any device and anywhere without needing a high end device to make it watchable. You advertise that you can watch Disney+ anywhere but I dare you to watch this movie on any device and not get pissed off."
1306,8,"Who decided Gilgamesh was a suitable name? Listen, I'm sure the movie is fine but who decided that one of the eternals should be named Gilgamesh?? If you've actually read the ancient texts, the guy isn't exactly the nicest. There are also arguments to be made that in the text he sexually assaulted and bullied many so I'm not sure who at Marvel decided that this was a good choice. Never thought a college textbook would come in handy for a Marvel movie but here we are lol."
1307,5,"Convoluted with no Pay Off On paper, this film should be perfect. It has a phenomenal cast, a talented director and excellent source material. Unfortunately, the end result was far from perfection. I don't hate this film. I don't think that it deserves to be the only ""rotten"" film in the MCU (Captain Marvel, Age of Ultron and Iron Man 3 are far worse). That being said, there is way too much going on in way too short of time (and the film was nearly 2 1/2 hours!)My problem, walking away from the film, is that I did not care about any of the characters.When the characters fought with each other, I did not care.It was difficult to connect and relate to these beings who had lived for 7,000 years (at least on earth) and are nearly indestructible. On top of it all, they lacked any real personality. Even Kumail Nanjiani, who I think is hilarious, and Gemma Chan, who I think is brilliant, struggled to bring real emotion to the screen.The ""end of the world"" plot device is tiresome. It was introduced too quickly, resolved too easily and there wasn't any real risk.I am glad that Marvel is taking risks and not just putting out cookie-cutter films. I would like to see these characters pop up in other MCU entries so that they can develop true personalities. However, this is a film that turned convoluted and didn't pay off in my eyes."
1308,4,"Just......bland I don't understand how you can give this whole arc to Ikaros, and then just have him kill himself. That is just so lazy. Also, you kill off a character that actually has great charisma, and acting. Just bad...bad...bad."
1309,3,"Painful Just utter garbage. 2.5hrs of just nothing, boring repetitive dialogue. Seems like they put in 0 effort and just got some big names to try and make up for it.The characters were dull and boring and the cast even more so. I liked Richard Madden in Game of Thrones but this was just depressing.Boring, predictable film filled with a lot of nothing, a few mediocre mainstream actors, bad CGI and Harry Styles to sell some tickets.3/10 for me, would've been a 2/10 but watching it with my girlfriend made it somewhat fun."
1310,2,"Snooze worthy I love MCU movies and shows. So when the previews for this started airing I was super excited! But after watching it and almost falling asleep several times, it dawned on me I've never dozed off during an MCU movie In my life. My biggest complaint about one was that black panther had decent acting but it lacked the flow with connection to other MCU movies. Well, this externals movie lacked just about everything. Boring, lack luster acting, the plot lacked in adventure that's usually in the mcu movies, and there was definitely no flow of connection to other MCU characters or movies or shows even if it's supposed to show some form of ""beginning"". Sorry MCU not a fan of this one. I will say though, if you haven't seen Hawkeye on Disney +, watch it! Hawkeye is bad ass! But eternals you are eternally boring. Also it's not ""kid friendly"" for those 13-16. It's more for 17 and up! There's other MCU movies that are more kid friendly!"
1311,10,"incredibly enjoyable, 10/10 since others are exaggerating too I'll keep it short: The movie was lovely. Yes it's long and there are so many characters but it doesn't feel stretched and crowded because those things are handled well. It's also different from other marvel stories which is always a plus."
1312,4,"It all felt like it was trying to be more than is was. Most of the movie felt forced, it was trying to be an Avengers movie or even x-men, but it was not. Some of the humor was fun, most fell pretty flat. And if the hints at new movies, new characters at the end is all Disney has up their sleeve, they've got a long dry spell coming."
1313,8,Great StoryTeller I guess particular Marvel Fans don't like a great storyteller. I for one was very hesitate watching this film. As being a cheap skate and wait till Disney plus release the film. I wish I saw the film on an actual IMAX theater.
1314,7,"Not What I Expected I had been looking forward to seeing Marvel Studios' Eternals. My expectations were very high, but it turned out that there's lots of awkward and lame acting scattered all over. To be honest, even though it's a different product than what we are used to and I kinda liked it, it simply falls short."
1315,8,"I must be different from other Marvel fans because I loved it I loved this movie. I have watched all the MCU films and I would actually rank this towards the top. Truthfully, I didn't care for Infinity War or End Game. This actually had something other than too big of a cast and super hero poses. For me, this movie had heart. I must admit Sprite was a tad annoying though."
1316,3,"Disappointing Bad plot, Bad acting, Bad film.Seemed to drag on forever, By far the worst Marvel film ever and after Captain Marvel that is really saying something."
1317,5,"Soulless Having just completed watching all MCU films in timeline order over the past 6 weeks, I can honestly say that this is the absolute worst of them. For perspective, the lowest I rated any of the MCU films was a 7 (Thor: Dark World), and maybe just one or two I rated an 8, and all the rest were 9's and 10's. My ratings are more heavily weighted towards story and characters first, then on acting and directing, and less so on action and special effects. Part of the problem with this film is the fact that it has too many new superheroes, whereas we are used to seeing characters introduced two-three at a time per movie. That just doesn't allow enough screen time for each character so that the audience invests in that character. Therefore the drama and emotion is lost. Like, I really didn't care that Ikarus flew into the sun, or that Ajak died, or finding out that Ikarus betrayed his brethren. As an MCU film, it will be held up to the others by the standard of audience-character attachment and I was not attached to any of the Eternals by the end of this movie. Another important attribute of the MCU films is humor, and this one fell flat for the most part, although Kumail Nanjani deserves praise for shouldering the burden of bringing humor to this film- he was very good, as was his sidekick character- but there just wasn't enough laughs like I've come to expect watching an MCU film. Other actors tried, they had their funny scripted moments, but they failed to deliver, which I think is the mostly if not entirely director's fault."
1318,3,"I didn't like the premise of this film Now Thor, I can take. Sure he's a ""god"", but this is Norse Mythology -- I studied this in a Catholic High School -- never, ever a competition for God. However with this film, it really appears that this is an atheist's version of all of Creation -- and I found that just too tough to swallow throughout the movie. That's primarily the reason for 3 stars.Otherwise, this group fights more amongst themselves than any other -- including killing each other, and for no apparently significant reasons either.Angelina Jolie looks fantastic, as usual, but most of the time (Read: very LONG time of the film) she just stands or sits around and does not do or say much at all. Certainly not like the first ""Tomb Raider"" at all!The rest of the cast were virtual unknowns to me; and it was difficult to assess them -- mostly because they really thought they were playing or serving some false god someone dreampt up.In summary, this was either like X-Men on a very warped tangent -- as they didn't seem to care about the Human Race much; or it was like some fake god-like fantasy continually dreampt up by Atheists. Either way, the film sucked.P. S. To the Marvel folks: Don't you dare think you are going to replace Iron Man or Captain America, in the Avengers, with any of these idiotic characters! Bring CA and Iron Man BACK!!!!! No further discussion!"
1319,8,Don't trust critics It's amazing... different that other MCU movies Cinematography was top notch and all performances were good... Ramin's background score is legendry as always.
1320,4,"Single hive mind of directors of venom 2 and eternals? The directors of venom 2 and eternals must be sharing a hive mind of their own, because venom 2 is definitely screwed and this crap is heading down the same path. Eternals is boring, unmotivated and dumb to say the least. Two and a half hour went into setting the plot of absolute nothingness and then in two minutes it was all over. The post credit scene was longer than the final battle sequence. Another forgettable marvel venture which wasted a chunk of my life!"
1321,5,"so much potential wasted! They have rewind an amazing concept and a great movie idea with poor casting and poor acting. This movie would have been so much better if they had casted better like they usually do with the MCU!Visuals are amazing, production and excursion is what we are used to in the MCU, but i expected that connection we had with previous marvel heroes, that thought of this is captain america, this is iron man and no one could've done better.Its just BAD.."
1322,3,Bring on Blade Mershala Ali's voice in the after credits scene is the best thing about this movie.Give us the Day Walker.Some MF Are Aways Trying to Ice Skate Uphill.
1323,1,Worst movie Worst marvel movie ever. Boring boring.it shouldn't even be a marvel at all. They could have done so much more with the movie. I waited to watch it and its 2/12 hours of boring movie. It has the feel of the actors trying to just get by with the graphics being enough to get by.
1324,5,"Has the Marvel features, but still comes up short. I had really high hopes for this film as the next installment in the Marvel universe. Typical Marvel greats: action, great one-liners, superpowers. Gemma Chan is absolutely brilliant.But it falls flat. The story is slow, and outside of the occasional mention of Endgame events, it doesn't fit into the MCU. Angelina Jolie should not have been cast- she felt forced and uncomfortable. Most characters don't have you rooting for them, which makes the story lifeless."
1325,4,"I tried, I really really tried... Frankly I am not impressed after 45 minutes, and am going to bed...again, no character building at all other than a text intro you are supposed to read to have a clue what the movie is supposed to be about...and then the action and dialog never follows that intro...Of the three or four monsters I saw, one looked more like an evil Groot and the other was almost straight out of Monster Hunter...these new producers and directors at Marvel have little to no imagination it seems, and like I said, it's off to bed for me...Addendum:No, it has not gotten any better after waiting for a while...I made the mistake of giving it a second try from where I left off, and all it is is fighting evil, poorly imagined creatures, but with no storyline at all...this is a bust for me Marvel, give me Antman for crying out loud...!!!In summary, the 'WoW Factor' is non-existent in this movie..."
1326,3,"First 90 minutes are unbearable, but then it reaches Tommy Wiseau level of ""so bad it's good"" We can see from the example of the Eternals that different does not always mean better.For the first 90 minutes of the film, we listen to rather pointless dialogues of dull, boring, and useless characters, who not only don't want to be empathized with, one doesn't even want to see them on the screen. Druig could've been interesting, but he's made of pure cardboard just like everyone else.They make mistake after mistake, doing everything as slowly as possible. The presence of the deviants in the film has no impact whatsoever.The characters are just devices for virtue signaling. There's no reason to discuss what they are meant to represent, cause it's purely political and besides their intended messages they have no essence and are absolutely lifeless.In addition, all the film's attempts to tie the plot to ""human nature,"" to raise the questions of conflicts, overpopulation, and global warming are crushed by the pointlessness of the story itself and the uselessness of the ""characters."" I never thought Eternals would be the unlikely heroes since they are so indecisive and worthless it makes you wonder how did they even manage to succeed. Really makes you appreciate Tony Stark in Endgame, that was the spirit.At some point, the film slipped into Thor Ragnarok and started throwing up random comedy, but it was so bad I had more fun reading paid 10/10 this film's reviews on IMDB. Having Karun character in the film really added a lot, thanks.I don't know, it was so bad that I don't even want to dig into this movie.At least I ended up laughing at the silly Tommy Wiseau-level dialogue and actions at the end when random scenes replace one another without any meaning and everyone is acting on random minute-by-minute motivations.Surely something must have gone wrong during the production. The film flings too much into all directions, mixing random tones and ideas, supposedly dramatic scenes with supposedly funny ones. Some focus would've saved this, probably.Anyway, Eternals were plain bad. If you can survive in the sludge of boring pointless dialogue - you will be treated with hilariously bad writing and editing in the end.Should you watch it? I'd say - no. But if you can endure and not drop it in the first 30 minutes - you may have fun."
1327,6,"Meh ""Meh."" That summarizes most of the reviews i've read. For the amount of money spent on CGI, actors, costumes, and locations, this movie and the plot are just OK.You know the film has problems when very secondary actors, the deaf Eternal and the partner of Phastos have more energy and acting chops than the main characters. Amazing that after 7,000 years the main protagonists' chemistry is non-existant, and her current human one (so obviously chosen cause he looks like Icarus) is no better. All the flashbacks with some of the Eternals, and the whole Bollywood stardom for the Indian Eternal helps none of the present or past stories. The whole ""let's all find the others and fight the bad guy"" reminded me so much of the recent Justice League movie. You get these heroes together, with different powers (actually these DC and Marvel heroes have similar powers) they all battle the bad guys......and SO WHAT?If interested in stories involving immortals or eternals, checkout the short lived but excellent NY Detective TV shows: New Amsterdam, or Forever. Both have extremely handsome and talented actors and both explore issues around immortality. Both series got way better reviews at half the price of this boring Marvel movie."
1328,2,"Marvel's ""jump the shark"" moment This film is unbearable. The characters are lackluster, the plot drags on, and the music is entirely forgettable. When they started killing off characters, I struggled to remember who they even were. Don't waste your time with this film. I am beginning to feel like Marvel is starting to milk whatever assets they can because they are out of fresh ideas. Go watch any of the other Marvel movies again; they will still feel more fresh than this one."
1329,1,"Terrible. Did someone from DC put this together? I started pulling for the Variants by the time I stopped watching. I'll never get that 1hr and 17 minutes back. The origin story is terrible; pretentious, pessimistic, and terrible."
1330,3,"Well, that was a thing I saw This movie had a better cast than script. There was no buy-in to the characters or their convoluted relationships or motivations. It's nice to see Marvel try to add some diversity to the cast of heroes but it felt more like a list to check off than a desire to actually make fleshed-out characters that are more than just their aspect of diversity.The second half was better than the first, but there wasn't much to redeem this movie."
1331,3,Not good! not good at all! Didn't care if anyone died! It says eternals will return ... but should it? I hope if it returns they assign a new Director. This was a mess and a mess with no heart! There was not one character I cared for.
1332,10,"Wow movie.. Surprised it's under rating..why? Why? So lovely Graphics visuals, story top notched, Every character justify theirs value. This movie is far more better than Shang chi movie. Angelina Jolie's Weapons (Shiv Ji's Trishul ) so Lovely to see."
1333,7,"I was not bored for 2m5 hour so :) I think having this is being set in the MCU holds the movie back. There is a lot of talking but I was never bored and the action was great.I cant really get into what i loved with out spoilers, but can say you don't need to have seen any MCU movie before to enjoy this, but it is still a superhero movie.Its good, love to see more and where it goes from here :)"
1334,10,Far more Better than Shang chi Each character justify theirs value. Marvel thanks for this movie. Specially Angelina Jolie's Weapons (Shiv Ji's Trishul 🙏🙏🙏). Waiting for the next part...!
1335,3,What the hell was that It was not a good marvel movie. I thought Captain Marvel was entertaining but not great. Eternals is by far the worst marvel movie.. Its a shame had great actors.
1336,3,"Drawn out, bloated, and straight up boring One of my BIGGEST pet peeves in films is when the film has to explain the plot to the audience so they can understand what is going on, whats even worse is when it's done multiple times throughout the film. There's nothing more boring than watching a film that has multiple scenes of characters just talking to explain the plot of the film. This film is almost 3 hrs long, it easily could have been trimmed down to a shorter film and it would've been much more fun and entertaining. The majority of this film is just long drawn out dialogue or scenic shots and it makes it one of the most boring Marvel films. It's a great film to fall asleep to!"
1337,10,"AMBITIOUSLY LEGIT! If the MCU is claiming The Eternals as the genesis of Superheroes - then so be it Mr Kevin Feigi. What an incredible plot of a superhero story. I have always thought Zack Snyder's Justice League was the grandest of it all, but I guess not. This could be it even if the super powers of the Eternals are clearly borrowed from DC's Justice League. This is by far maybe the darkest but most exciting Marvel movie yet - in the biggest scale. I agree that the movie isn't the DNA of the franchise and its why many are confused. But my point is it doesn't have to be because this is suppose to be the point of origin - much like a prequel of the whole of MCU. Now I understand why Mr Feigi mentioned in an interview that Eternals is the movie to look forward to. Eternals is the most underrated and it needs redemption. I hope Marvel will continue the Eternals perhaps with a trilogy. Bravo!"
1338,1,"One of the worst of my entire life Don't waste your time, if you are a marvel fan or are really interested, read a synopsis, or watch it and skip to the visual scenes. The plot is really badly written, nothing makes much sense.The pacing is truly awful, everything happens randomly and the intensity varies randomly. There is no attachment, no character building, no interesting arc, just a bunch or random scenes one after another.The story is also awful, full of plot holes, absolutely utterly flawed. There is no verisimilitude, things happen because they were written as so, any explanations that exist just contradict themselves and are ridiculous.Finally, have disney forgot how to SHOW stuff? Like, do they think we are stupid? Most of the character lines are to explain stuff that you have just seen like 2 seconds before, things that need absolutely no explanation or that could be explained later. And they do explain the SAME STUFF they just explained later. Like, a minute later. This is not a space shuttle where you need to have 3 redundancies for every line, this is a movie!Just skip this one, it is not worth it. I have watched it for you, I have endured the pain for you. Skip it."
1339,5,What can I say it's Nice. There's a lot of things bother me in Marvel movies but the most annoying thing is why do thay always show humans are very simple and almost stupid. Thay spend so much money on this kind of movies i really wish thay spend all of this on something a little bit interesting or Worth watching and yes I admit thay have alot of famous actress on there disposaland Maybe some of them doing this just for money and i don't blame them it's alot of money but Marvel please you already spending all of this money away just try only once to make a really good movie something will make me believe that i still can be surprised like the first time I watched the Dark knight movie by Christopher Nolan. I know you don't like DC and iam not saying thay are good but I think I The Dark Knight is the best movie in the Marvel and DC combine together. So please take my breath away with a good movie I missed that.
1340,1,Horrible!! Hands down the worst Marvel movie ever! Who thought this was a good idea?I had to force myself to watch the entire movie and now I hate myself for it.Plot sucks. Characters suck. Please let it die and never be resurrected!
1341,3,"Slowwwwwwwww This movie is easily 45 minutes too long. It dragssssssss onnnnnnnnn foreverrrrrrrrrrr. It's terribly boring and slow as well. Very little humor, very little action, waaaaaay too much drama. I don't know how people enjoyed this movie. I'm guessing it's some kind of setup for.... Something? I don't know. But it was bad. 3 stars for the few jokes and one liners it did have."
1342,1,"Director has awesome power of turning millions into ash So this movie is about super powers and I realized that the most important person missing is the director ... he has amazing power of turning millions into ash .... How can someone waste so much money, cast famous faces and have such a good plot and ruin it altogether????Every character was trying to find a place and seemed confused about it... Aliens with super powers and are missing the most important thing .... Common sense !!!!And when they do bull crap ... they start chanting to each other ... oh you are an eternal or I m an eternal ..... The movie hardly has any enjoyable moments .... The story has poor continuity ..... not sure what was the purpose of Indian dudes in the movie .... They were completely not blending with the rest of the crew ....the Bollywood they showed in movie is from 1960s .... Present day Bollywood stars are way more handsome than Hollywood heroes.... This is an absolute lost project ... director should be banned from making movies Don't waste your time or money and watch some dog videos on YouTube ... you lll be eternally more entertained than this useless crap."
1343,1,"HORRIBLE ACTING! I spent most of the movie skipping through it looking for the action scenes because the acting was so bad that I cringed everytime they spoke.Politics has infiltrated Hollywood and that's why we don't see any good movies anymore. Angelina Jolie tried her best to carry the movie, but she too succumbed to the pressure of this horrible movie. I enjoyed the CGI, but I hated the acting!"
1344,3,"Marvel's worst Forever later, this train wreck is finally over. What was the reasoning for bringing this to us? This was a mess from the start. The acting and directing was off on this movie. Hopefully there will be no revisiting or including this bunch in any future movie."
1345,5,"The Eternal Marvel Film One of the more forgettable marvel movies, Eternals biggest problem is that it's far too long. Outside of that, there just isn't the usual fun that is found in most marvel movies. Gemma Chan doesn't change her demeanour once, always the same serious look on the face, no let up at all. The most interesting takeaway from the film is the post-credit teaser of Blade, now that should be a good time."
1346,6,Expecting more but it went below average When the new phase of heroes started I was yeahhh more (mighty heroes) but this movie turned into broken dreams. From beginning I thought I was watching a Greek Mythology movie started with the 12 Olympos gods... included Peter Pan and a guy with lazer eyes who also can fly like Superman.... ended with a frozen Titan Statue decorate the earth. No imagination to create something that people and earth can grap... Mix Grill fantasy. Find the imagination creating heroes and not only effects.
1347,4,"Not a Marvel movie I will try and keep this short. This movie felt nothing like Marvel. They used one guy to bring humor. It felt forced. The whole movie was kind of boring. We were 30mins into the movie and nothing was gripping our attention. There was no that famous Marvel spark. This movie just felt so ditched from Marvel... Everything felt fake and low budget. The costumes, cgi, story, wigs... The weird abrupt cutting from one scene to the next. Characters have no soul. And then, the weirdest thing of all - Harry Styles, the singer, is now an actor... And he's Thanos' brother. Like... What? Needless to say, we won't be watching this movie ever again (like we watch all the Marvel movies multiple times) and thank God we didn't pay to see it. I have no idea what was the point with this movie. It was just... Bad."
1348,1,"I gave it a shot Well, I gave it a shot. Everything bad thing you have heard about this movie is TRUE. You care ZERO about the characters. Its like the writers and director were focusing on.......other things they thought were more important instead of good story telling, a good script, etc...I'm not sure what happened to Marvel, but what ever has happened to them lately they need to get it right quickly....most of their movies lately have been horrible.DISNEY needs to wake up, I am canceling my service with them until they change course."
1349,7,"Works on paper, but do we care enough If a restaurant needs good service, good food, and atmosphere - then a film is not entirely different. It's service is the delivery - the acting, editing, cinematography, CGI, direction sound etc. It's food is the story - a lot more straightforward, but it also needs atmosphere. This is the murkier zone where as viewers we care and become invested in the outcomes. Like a restaurant this zone of atmosphere is also dependent upon the delivery and the films food, its story.On paper, Eternals ticks these boxes - the actors do their stuff and the film is delivered extremely slickly. As an epic and classic heroes story - it should also work - but somehow just falls short of really creating the appropriate atmosphere - for me anyway - and I like these epic adventure tails, but this one felt a bit hollow and failed to get me really involved and invested.I suspect some of that has to do with the insistence to continually lighten things up with its joking throwaway one liners - that at times given what is going on are inappropriate and release too much pressure from the story and the gravity of the predicament that the movie is attempting to convey. But it's not entirely that - I think it's also partly because of the somewhat disjointed method of revealing the story - the edits and timeline cuts. There's also the classic aspect of 'show don't tell'. Eternals does a lot of telling, in fact it's a very dialogue driven movie - and for this reason won't really be enjoyed by kids (not the younger ones at least).I suspect that Eternals would greatly benefit from a Zak Snyder Justice League type recut.At the end of the day though, it's entertaining but doesn't quite 'zing' that last few percent to elevate it into great status - enjoyable nonetheless. Should have been an 8 or 9 - but I'm giving it a 7."
1350,8,"A nice introduction EternalsStunning visuals and fight scenes, lush diversity in characters and themes, with an enjoyable plot.The movie would have excelled better if a lot wasn't tried to be sandwiched into it, and if the pacing from past to present had been handled more delicately and slowly, apparently a prequel series may be in the works. The whole frenzy on it possibly having a more aged viewership is balderdash, those scenes are absolutely nothing. I'll call that sex scene 'exaggerated cuddling'."
1351,1,"Stool water material... Just another piece of lack of substance s*ite which the Marvel universe has become. The effects are the best of the best, but the actors and actresses (the elite club of inward admiration from Hollywood) are so stale and souless and the script and storytelling is so embarrassingly badly written ya have to turn this off and do something more worth your time, like writing this review before bedtime. *yawn*"
1352,1,"Eternal Rubbish Almost two and a half hours long, this was just plain boring to watch that not even the special effects could save it but you have to admit Angelina Jolie is still a hottie.. don't you think?"
1353,5,"Not as good as expected The graphics were great, but ...... It's a bad plot and a bit boring. They tried too much to connect the ideas and at the end there's not much to follow. It's not worth the ticket price."
1354,6,Tiring About at the point of giving up on these superhero movies. I think they are being made for fanboys and nerds. A lot of people like superhero movies but movies made like this one appeal to a small minority them.
1355,5,"Why isn't Angelina Jolie the lead? As per the title, this is the only question I would like an answer to. This film has a very slow pace. I'm halfway through, it's not engaging (although I did like the recreation of Babylon,) and I'm going to (maybe) finish watching it tomorrow. As others have mentioned; Jolie is a beast of an actress. If you're going to cast her in a Marvel film, make her the lead, or pay her fee for a cameo and leave it at that."
1356,10,Different from other MCU movies I went in with the attitude that it's probably going to suck. I actually enjoyed the movie. It was different enough to hold my attention and make me look forward to the second movie (hopefully). I really want to see where they take this storyline. When Endgame came out it I lost interest in the MCU and was ready to put the last 12 years behind me. Glad I watched it.
1357,3,"Marvel do high fantasy badly Bow let's start by saying I am a big fan of marvel and have enjoyed the development of the franchise over the years and was interested to see where this was going but I was so disappointed with the outcome.I am not going to get bogged down describing the plot what little ther is all I will I will just address the wider theme which with an amazing cast seems to have lost its way so convinced of its own importance it seems to want to make a statement that is mnot there the plot is jumpy and the story is week and irattic and the worst And saddest part is not only do I not care about the characters with a few exceptions I actively dislike them.If I cared about them, I might be prepared to let the plot holes and weekness pass but it seems to me if this is marvels new direction they are in for a rude awakening.please let this be a slight anomaly and not the new direction, I think the critics were so taken with how new everything was they forgot what marvel comics were truly about and who there core fans are and what they love."
1358,8,"I liked it! This is an ok movie. Not a bad way to spend a few hours. If you expect Citizen Zane, you'll be disappointed but if you wanted a great sci fi with lots of zing, pow and action you'll be happy. This is a story driven movie that is great for a pizza or gin night."
1359,2,"Oh dear Unfortunately this is the most 'inclusive' movie so far (not a good thing), they certainly used the wrong director for this. Opportunity missed. I've not felt that I'd wasted my time watching a movie in a long time but this was a struggle to get through."
1360,10,"I loved it Especially after that brainless Shang-Chi fight movie, it was a nice change of pace. My only criticism is that the exposition part felt a little drawn out, maybe they should've written it in a way so it doesn't feel like exposition, instead just part of the story organically. Otherwise the visuals are astonishing and very stylish and I love how besides the armed conflicts there are so many moral conflicts among many sides even within teams. And of course how there are always concequences to your actions."
1361,2,"Cgi Worst CGI I've ever seen in a marvel film. Story is convoluted, doesn't make too much sense. Time jumps are unbearable, with the caliber of actors they had they could've done so much better. Felt like a lazy attempt to do something different from the usual marvel films. 0/10 if i could."
1362,1,"Really awful I've sadly fallen asleep in a lot of good films. I'm saddened to say that I stayed awake for this one and it's a couple of hours of my life I will never have back.Awful script, awful acting, awful storyline. Unrecommemded..."
1363,8,"Not just another superhero film Having read negative reports of this movie, I didn't know what to expect but went in with an open mind.And I was pleasantly surprised.This isn't just a load of fighting, car chases and destruction. There is intelligent discourse, character development and sone excellent historical scenery. Yeah there are some lapses in research with regard to the final point, but the recreation of Babylon's Ishtar Gate and Gupta Empire shikharas and quite spectacular. The plot twists are usually unexpected and serve to aid an engaging storyline.The plot is pretty close to a lot of the original comics and involves a substantial amount of conversation rather than pure mindless action. If you are familiar with the comics, there are a lot ""Ah-hah!"" events presumably laying groundwork for the next series of MCU films. The work as a whole very much has the feel of something which was originally created by the late Jack Kirby.I suspect the negative reviews come largely from those viewers who prefer explosions to dialogue or aren't comic book readers.In the end I really enjoyed this film exactly because it DIDN'T feel like just another Avengers or Spider-man flick. If you prefer your movies to be a little more developed than ""Die Hard XXVII,"" or something then you might just enjoy this."
1364,1,"Folllywood! Follywood! Follywood! I've learned to be prepared. Everything coming out of Follywood is a joke. Disney, Sony, Warner, Universal etal. These are major entities being controlled by a foreign, hostile government. Is it any wonder the messaging would be corrupt, disruptive and hypocritical? I'll watched it holding my nose and sitting far from anything I may have been tempted to throw at the screen. Hey, at least I didn't pay to watch it!!!"
1365,3,Meh Spent so long making sure they had included every minority imaginable no one bothered to make a worthwhile film. It's a shame really as it had great potential but never managed to actually take off. Felt like I watched their 7 millennia year by year. Not sure the film knew quite what it wanted to be.
1366,4,"Just because it is different from other Marvel Doesn't make it ground breaking or lacking cliche. It neither avoids mediocre acting nor tiring attempts to inject middle school philosophy. Still, bits are fun and engaging even if the whole is not. Any movie which in all seriousness uses ""the truth will set them free"" without huge comic intention deserves a degree of derision surely? Anyway, am sure there will be those that love it and defend it and those that hate it. It's Marvel after all."
1367,1,"Absolutely dreadful. The ending credits say ""Eternals will Return"". I hope not. This is the worst film I've ever seen. I've no idea what was going on from start to finish. How Disney put this out is beyond me. I've seen some awful films in my time. But to call this film awful is an insult to awful films the world over. Don't bother watching it. It's pants. I'd have used stronger wording than ""awful"" if I could be it would never get published on here. Seriously. Just avoid this movie at all costs. If someone offers you money to watch it. Just plain refuse."
1368,2,"YAAWWWNNNNN Im not going to give this a huge review, not worth the time, fell asleep half way through and i never fall asleep during good movies. Lacked pace, substance and good acting. I will give it a thumbs up on the cinematography though."
1369,4,"Recycled eternally stretched superhero movies drama Finaly they got the CGI right... There were several spectacular CGI moments.. And thats about it..So this ONE planet was definitely worth saving, to stop an entire galaxy/ies? With hundreds? Of new worlds with zillions of inhabitants to be created ? That math makes sense..Makes senseAnd in Eternals 2 there will be a teist after they discover TikTok?"
1370,1,"Anyone watch for more than 20 minutes? Is anyone watching for more than 20 minutes?So I didn't know... Will it get better after that?Maybe it's made a ""B"" movie for the TV - who knows?Todays, I think you can see much better TV movies on TV without Class A stars...A worthy competitor to Wonder Woman 1984 in the ""Worst Movie in 2021"" category! The budget is more than ""plus"" - minimum double... Pfff...Don't waste Your time, watch something Better - randomly..."
1371,7,"I'd watch Eternals 2 I liked it because it was interesting to watch and hard to predict. First ten minutes is just waste of time. Without the first 50min the movie would be much better.These superhero's are weak. They can't even handle optimum prime.I didn't liked the two lead actors but others were ok. Especially Kingo and his valet are good.Everything feels little bit off because it's like watching superman, wonder woman and flash in a marvel Universe.A plea to all movie makers: Stop doing flashbacks or going back in time to tell a story. Also stop making prequels go forward in time not backwards. Tell something new."
1372,1,"This must have made Warner Bros day. I feel for the folk who paid to watch this trash. Basically a two and half hour united colours of Benetton advert. It's taken an obscure Kirby run and made it into something so irrelevant to the rest of the MCU it's unrecognisable. The plot,script and tone are juvenile, but with the actors and effects must have cost a fortune to make. An absolute waste of talent, money and time. If this is the direction Disney are taking Marvel it's sad for those who grew up reading Stans greatest."
1373,1,"Pathetic Chinese version. It should have been more fun, action packed like the other MCU movies. What in the hell director was thinking to make? A Chinese remake? This is even worse than Ironman 3 and Age of Ultron. I can't understand whether it is a romantic movie, action movie, sci fi, drama, horror? What the hell this garbage is?"
1374,3,Would rather read the epic of Gilgamesh than ever watch this again Just a weak movie overall. Long run time. Shang Chi and No Way Home are far superior movies in the MCU. Was interested at first and as the movie continued on it became a snooze fest.
1375,5,"Celestials, a history of pretty incompetent creators, and their overal stupidity. Apparently Celestials, the giga-brains of creation, who poses godlike technology, and power, are too incompetent, and stupid, to invent a different way of creating new Celestials other than killing almost immeasurable amount of intelligent life in the universe. **Even tho killing life, is not even a needed part of the process.**Idk, but maybe, just maybe, use that god-like technology, and power to create substitute planets, and relocate life, so it doesn't DIE?!Apparently creating stars, and spacetime travel in a blink of an eye is no biggie, but creating a ball of rock is beyond their capabilities.I guess it wouldn't be an interesting story, if Celestials were smart, lolSeriously, there are so many plot holes, and general inconsequential stupidity in Marvel universe that watching this movie simply hurts.5 starts for visuals.0 for story."
1376,10,"Top tier marvel movie Still can't understand why so many people don't like this movie. Besides having some of the best and more fun action I've seen, the fact that Zhao is capable of making you care for all 10 main characters in just a single movie is just proof of the amazing world building and storytelling she is able to bring to the table.Brutally underrated."
1377,8,So much better than other kids movies of marval I have no idea why so many people criticised about this movie and i had taken my expectations low as everyone else before watching this movie. But this movie turns out to be actually very good movie. So it's different than conventional marval movie specifically no silly jokes.Don't listen to the negative reviews. Watch yourself and decide.
1378,3,"Christ above what huge waste of time Long, booooooooring af over/under acted.Including EVERY SINGLE group is a horrible idea. 2:35 for absolutely nothing. One can't connect with any of the characters, I forgot who's who, who can do what. It's not even about the super powers, just horrible story telling dragged all the way to hell. Even the ""twist"" in this movie is unsurprisingly predictable and boring."
1379,1,"Another Snore Fest I was watching this on a streaming service, and fell asleep. Literally.Nothing good could be said about this other than as a cure for insomnia.Lifeless characters - no one to identify with - unless you're a hidden demigod.Ugly radio (aka ""shaky cam"" & ""wobble cam"" ).MCU should stick this behind ""the Inhumans"" and bury them both."
1380,3,"So boring. Should have been 90mins Ugh. What a waste of 2+ hrs. Boring bland characters, uninteresting story, visuals look decent, it's just impossible to care about any of these characters, or their plight.I'd rather just rewatch literally any other marvel film than this. I'd rather watch Green Lantern than this."
1381,9,6.7!???? This movie is so good that you don't need to have watched every other Marvel movie to enjoy it. People just love to hate on everything nowadays. Only reason I didn't give it a 10 was Icarus fate.
1382,3,"What a disaster The worst thing about this film is you can see the potential it could have had. All in all it was cast well - but the writing is unbearable. I don't know how they thought they could introduce 10 new characters and have the audience feel connected to them all in just one movie. Didn't they take a few tips from DC's Justice League as to what NOT to do? Evidently not. The constant desperate attempt at humour is exhausting to watch and not unlike a train wreck. Any character building that could have happened simply doesn't. The problems that do arise seem so easily fixed that the film seems pointless. And just when it's over and you're thanking your lucky stars you don't have to watch those talented actors struggle their way through a dire script and plot..... Harry Styles shows up. Words cannot express what a bad choice of casting this was. In the worst end credit scene that has ever been thought of.... Styles lack of experience and ability is shone a spotlight on next to the likes of amazing actors like Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, and Salma Hayek."
1383,5,"Boring, boring, boring I am watching this right now, it is so boring and dreadful that is absolutely painful to even stay awake. Acting is ok but the movie it self? Awful. Marvel is obviously running out of ideas. I am trying to find something interesting or hoping it will get better but it doesn't. Hopefully no one will create another episode. Enough is enough."
1384,4,"Wasteful and dull Where to start!The positives - a strong cast, inclusive.Sadly, that's about it.The excellent cast appear bored throughout, and I was wracking my brain trying to figure out why from around ten minutes in. I think it's the script. The feels incredibly formulaic, and I don't feel like the cast were remotely inspired. They perform the lines well, but their performances lack any kind of passion or enthusiasm.It could be the director was unable to motivate them, or it could be there were myriad execs and producers interfering with the process and rendering the project confused by the burden of foreshadowing and building phase 4.It's not a complete dud. The best performance for me was Kit Harrington, and the highlight was a little Pink Floyd at the beginning.I am left bored and very concerned for the future of the MCU."
1385,1,"Just, don't. Don't even know where to begin; There's not any explicit spoilers here, just generalizations:-1 for the terrible plot/story -1 for failing to integrate into the MCU (no cameos, no Tony Stark popping up suddenly going: wtf, peeps? Who's the big dude? Who you? What's all the gold stuffs? Who's the joovie? Does she like spiders?) -1 for Ikarus character & actor (just terrible - cringed everytime he appeared on-screen - graduate of the Steve Austin Acting Academy, wot?) -1 for blubberface McPlasticJolie (should have been paired with Ikarus and then dumped into a nuclear event at the beginning of the movie removing them both completely thus vastly improving the overall experience) -1 for insanely boring content and preachy memes -1 for pointless boink scene with Sersei/Ikarus -1 for yet-another CGI boss/villian -1 for the weirdest and weakest powers (Druig.) -1 for Sprite angst, ripped off from a certain New Orleans vampire author -1 for inequitable power distribution (Ikarus v. Everyone else) -1 for making me think someone owes me money after watching this drek.Gemma Chan's character, Sersei, was the most wishy-washy approval-seeking mealy-mouthed super hero I've seen to date. You'd think that several millenia of existence, coupled with some kick-ass super-powers would give the character more of a Wonder-Woman-like savoir-faire, no? No. Her character has all the self-assurance of a beaten-down high-school science teacher.I love the MCU - whatever this was, it was worse than even Dark Phoenix.Not even Salma Hayek could save this bomb, that's how bad it is."
1386,6,"Eternals Eternals comes across as a muddled standalone MCU film. There are four credited writers.The Eternals are immortal beings with superpowers. They came to Earth 7,000 years ago to kill the predatory Deviants, they are dragon like monsters.The Eternals were created by Celestial creator Arishem. They all have different powers and abilities. Since then they have been shaping civilisation on Earth.In modern day London. Eternal Sersi (Gemma Chan) comes across a Deviant attack, the first in hundreds of years.Sersi along with other Eternals, Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sprite go to South Dakota to find their leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek) has been killed.They reunite with the rest of the Eternals to fight the Deviants who seem to have evolved. Instead they learn their true purpose on Earth.The first part of the film has lots of exposition. I doubt a lot of the audience would be aware of the Eternals. Some of it is wrapped up in Greek mythology.There seems to be a more adult approach by Marvel here. There is even a love scene and a gay kiss. Director Chloé Zhao won a best Director Oscar by the time the film was released.Adult could also mean more po faced. The character of Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is on hand for comic relief. The movie also has the chutzpah to mention a couple of DC heroes including Superman.This might be as the film also explores the dark side of having superpowers.Eternals was a creative risk for Marvel. A break from the formula but not a radical one. Even then it has proved divisive with the audience.It is too long, the acting is wooden. Too many of the characters lacked charisma. Some of the dialogue was hackneyed.Still there was lot that was enjoyable, it dazzled in parts with a lot of money spent on special effects."
1387,3,"Well...that's all I have to say The MCU contains a ""mythology"" about the big bang and the coming into being with the Celestials and their minions the Eternals. But who got the idea to create a movie about that story???It's nice to see the arrival of ""extraterrestrials"" like the Eternals on earth in the Stoneage and to see their acting through the centuries. It's quite nice to see the battles of the Eternals with the supposed ""bad"" Deviants and finally the disillusion about their real reason of being created from Celestials. But who cares?In the post-trailer another Eternal called Starfox and Pipp the troll were pushed on scene.- Adam Warlock would've been better I think.Well...that's all I have to say."
1388,6,"ReWatch it at a 1.5x Speed If you increase the playback speed to 1.5x it takes away the dragged out slowness and it becomes a half decent movie.The actors speak relatively slow throughout so the voices at an increased speed sound normal.More importantly, the increased playback speed makes the action scenes look PHENOMENAL!!"
1389,8,"SECOND BEST MARVEL MOVIE OF 2021 This movie just came on disney plus and I loved it. I have no idea where the bad reviews came from when this movie launched. Please watch this movie if you can, it plays a major part in the mcu and the most heart felt team in the mcu yet."
1390,9,"Really well done Marvel now has made headlines and can irritate some people, but all the hate this movie gets is unfounded. Is it long yes but you can see that from the run time before you watch it. This movie is thought provoking and pushes marvel in a new way. It leaves the audience with a little more thought than just wow did you see all that action, which there is still a good amount of action in it. Please if you have a free afternoon or weekend that you made no plans give it a shot with an open mind. You may enjoy as much as I have."
1391,1,"lion king Theme song ?? This boring, lifeless movie which is not successful of delivering anything to audience, kinda used theme music of lion king. Search in youtube Hans Zimmer - Remember then skip forward to 0.40 and listen it for 20 sec. NOT FAMILIAR ??"
1392,10,I don't understand the hate🤷‍♀️ I loved it. I am 33 years old and have seen the Marvel universe expand so much. This made it bigger to me. Made is MORE. People complaining about the CGI and it being drawn out.. the story had alot to say!! I guess anyone can find something they don't like if they look hard enough😬
1393,10,"Just a word for all you 10 raters Guys this film is bad very bad definitely not a 10 bad, I think you had to have rated the wrong film cos this film is not a 10 maybe a 1, but even 1 is too much, some people just get film ratings wrong and this is one of them, now go and stand in the corner for a month."
1394,10,"Man this film is soooooooooooo boring It's like one of them crap sci fi rip offs of a top box office film, yeah it looks quite nice in areas but that's all it has going for it, god it's sooo boring, it had potential to be something but it ain't, yet another marvel film that's not marvellous, what is this film any way is it that live die repeat with to cruise or is it super man, or is it avatar I really don't know it's all mixed messages in this, my advise don't waist your time, definitely some sketchy acting as well."
1395,4,"formulaic dross Sorry but this is not for me. I am sure the CGI won many people over but what about some intelligence, some half decent dialogue would have been useful.How about some humour. Blimey it was long, long . Free humanity from this dross."
1396,1,"Cheap, poorly written Disappointing dialogue Sexual undertone much different from other marve films that betrays the family focus I knew this idea would be difficult to pull off trying to introduce a brand new concept and several unheard of plot-hole-ridden characters in a single film.They bit off more than they could chew and I'm not impressed."
1397,9,"It's well done...... It's a different take on a ""Hero"" I think it's a building block movie to take off from . I personally would like to see where they go next. The story is slower and it's has ""action"" this one makes you think outside the box. So is it the Avengers series, no it's not let's get to know the Eternals !!!"
1398,9,"Far, Far Better Than I Expected Just watched Eternals and was presently surprised. After watching the trailer months ago I thought the film looked dull so held off watching it until it's release on Disney+ today. How wrong was I! The film is really good and kept me interested all the way through. The characters are all good and the story is interesting and believable. After being disappointed with some of marvels latest films, especially End Game and Black Widow, I was not left disappointed with this. I would have to say this is one of the better marvel films I have seen and can't wait for the second film and how marvel will follow on from this film in its future movies."
1399,3,The film is bad and Salma is even worse. The film is plainly awful. Marvel films change a massive part of the original comics and characters but least you can giggle at them every now and again. This one is just a big mistake. I can't imagine where will they take the next star wars trilogy. Sad times for cinema.
1400,1,"I usually don't review but... I have been a fan of Marvel until now. What a bad film, it had very little content, the scenes were the same, effects with nothing inventive. The group of actors had no connection. Disappointed."
1401,9,"Pleasant surprise. My ratings are genre specific by the way.This is a 9 based upon the Marvel films. Not compared to others. Just my own system. For me Shawshank is also a 9 but obviously a better film.Anyway, I digress. Eternals is very good, genuinely interesting plot and not too generic as many Marvel films can be, plot twists and individual character development that really kept me interested. An ending that even though CGI heavy was not overwhelming mess as other Superhero movies have been.My only gripe was the repetitive clashes between heroes and creatures but not overly annoyed.Anyway, a definite above average entry into the MCU and compared to how I felt about future phases of MCU after Endgame having seen this and a very enjoyable Shanh-Chi I am keenly looking forward with optimism."
1402,4,"Eternal what? I don't read the comics. There's no answers in this movie. So it must be in the comics then..?Eternal means not eternal? Why not your enemy enemys is your best friend? Why more then 2 hours wasted time for (again) a movie without ending? Why not the first time do something, no wait 5 minutes till the end then.This movie is unsatisfying. And not worth for the money and time."
1403,2,"Just awful Felt I had to watch it because, you know, Marvel. Oh lord, I stopped it several times to do housework, because I did not care about these characters. The storyline was poor. The casting choices were wrong. Visuals and scenery were great. But that's it. The decision for them all to keep their accents? Such a bad decision. I seriously doubt there'll be a second installment."
1404,10,"Why so many negative reviews? I really liked this one , I actually enjoyed almost every moment of it and the thing is I think most people don't get how sarcastic the whole story is! Because it's not a superhero movie it's a movie about free will choice and love!Eternals are a race of immortals planned and placed in every planet with sentient life in them , they are led to believe that they are fighting to preserve the human (sentient) lives while in reality they're only fighting to make sure that humans and they themselves are sacrificed at the right moment ! The sad part is that just like every other soldier who is blindly following his /her superiors they are not excluded from carnage , and actually are worthless. Only after leading a normal life away from their mission ( army?) they begin to question their life's purpose and their mission. Did I have to fight and kill my enemies? Are they even my enemies? Did throw away every chance of happiness? Why am I following a leader with dubious methods? Why can't I have a normal life ?Seriously it's a really good movie yes it's a bit campy and yes it's filled with visuals.. but I think it's better than all the avengers movies combined."
1405,9,"LOVED THE FILM!!!!! This film was a breath of fresh air in the mcu which was becoming little predictable and cluttered with same choices. The scope of the film was good, the cinematography commendable as well as the music. The character motivations and conflicts were impressive and relatable, the world building and its exposition so good. Celestials, their purpose and the grand scheme of things was so good. Dealing with loyalty, mental health issues, commitment and self doubt. People are saying it felt wooden in acting but it felt natural to me as in other Chloe zhao films. The comedy was good too, nothing forced as in other mcu films. Druig, Kingo, Karun, Ikaris were so good. I dont know about others but hell this film was something new and beautiful. Yeah a couple downfalls sure but nothing major."
1406,6,"Very disappointing Eternal is without a doubt the worst movie in the MCU. It's long drawn, the script is bad and the casting is just wrong. The only positive thing to say about it is the visuals."
1407,4,"just watchable with a pinch of salt If you never ever read the good old eternal comics,and you like wokism, then you will enjoy this movie,not much ofc.Otherwise you will feel very very bitter."
1408,3,"Just didn't like... Felt this was just a plain bad movie, a waste when there are so many great stories in the Marvel universe yet to tell. Good effects though. But stupid all the same."
1409,1,"absurd I think this movie was an irreparable mistake in the Marvel movie series. Irrational, rhetorical, unrelated to previous films, a very superficial cliché."
1410,2,"Awful Imagine spending $200 million making this garbage. With an elite cast and a hundred ""million"" opportunities- at least that was what I expected. Instead I got bland performances, a badly written script, poorly made CGI and a too long story. None of it made me want to continue and the movie hasn't even a clear story or plot. Highly disappointing. I like movies with beautiful visuals, ""indie"", spiritual and far stretched. But this was trying too hard and didn't achieve anything by it. It didn't stick with me and I never thought about it again.Can the film industry stop spending this amount of cash by making USELESS GARBAGE. This money could've gone to important things- something the world needs. We don't need this movie."
1411,1,Why was the movie shot in the night? Almost 99% of the scenes in this movie were shot in the night . I strained my eyes trying to recognize the characters and strained my ears trying to understand what the eternals are speaking.Please don't make any movie like this.
1412,5,"Great if you need to: If you need to file your taxes, do some ironing, pay some bills, look no further, this is the perfect background movie for you! It's super slow paced so you don't have to pay attention 90% of the time and the plot is built up of tropes, so yeah, iron away!"
1413,5,"Not up to the mark One of the horrible movie of MARVEL. Some of the characters part was boaring. ""We want an MCU movie to be different from the formula!""*Marvel releases Eternals*Eternals review: It doesn't feel like an MCU movie..."
1414,1,"Wow, that was sad You can't do a Terrence Malik on a marvel super hero film. Can't be done, with all the good intentions of the world. Director hasn't really grasped the world she is trying to tell us. Great cinematography, but people staring in the distance in magic hour, for 2 hours and a half...would work great if you shoot a commercial like ""Volvo - moments"" but not on a feature... Not even going to mention the cast..."
1415,1,"Who could like this? When I saw the previews I thought this looked absolutely dreadful, I've never even heard of the Eternals and I was a Marvel fan all through the 70s and 80s. I did lean more towards Spider-Man and the Punisher. I did not go see this in the theater because I just couldn't care. When they released it for Disney+, I tried watching it, I made about 40 minutes before I turned it off. This was very confusing and I just could not care about any of the characters. And whatever was going on with the imagery, it was so dark I could not see the nighttime scenes nor the scenes that take place inside structures or whatever dark place the scene was in. I turned it off and I don't believe I missed anything."
1416,7,"So much better then expected I just caught this in Disney + and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a nice change to the standard marvel movie ensemble. It had great mix of humour and action! I enjoyed how it felt like an international movie with different eternals mixing into different cultures and it balanced it well without being to ""PC"" or preachy. It did feel to long and I must admit I was a little disappointed at how the Uber deviant story played out towards the end as they made one hell of a tense enemy. All in all this was a solid movie and i cannot see how it go such bad reviews. Its by fair not the worst! I found it better then black widow(but close). It would be a crying shame if we dont get a second one."
1417,3,"Should be called The Infernals Trite, overbearing and just plain pap.... Marvel pursuing the dollars. Sad sad sad sad and sad...soundtrack is wasted on this.I cannot believe this made it out of concepting; bit it's Disney."
1418,1,"Cringed Horrible , just Horrible !To MARVEL , WTF is THIS ???FIRE the screenwriters, directors & anyone who had any input on this movie. MARVEL, with ALL your resources at your disposal it's really embarrassing that you people release this kind of GARBAGE ! Do you care about your fans and costumers at all ? Or are you people just trying to make more money on top of all you have by slashing whatever you can to come up w/ this TRASH. From the beginning of the movie I was shaking my head from the NONSENSE I was seeing & in the hope that it will get better ! Sadly it just got worse and worse by the minute. Anyone w/ ANY kind of COMMON SENSE can see the stupidity of what they are seeing . A 10 year old can come up with a better STORY & DIALOG between the actors ! I do not blame the actors @ all, as they simply were doing their job. I honestly will stop here MARVEL... you people do not deserve a minute more of my time.Stopped watching the movie at the 16:55 minute mark !Try A LOT harder next time !"
1419,6,"too long...but a watchable mess... Maybe i need ADHD pills...so that, when everything changed every other minute, i could keep interested...i felt there was just too much information to ever settle into a storytelling groove that wasn't grabbing me and tossing me around as much as happened to the characters... it wasn't bad, though...just needed more focus and some cutting down on whatever fat could be excised...make it tighter..."
1420,10,"Answer to God: When I return I will judge all humanity. After all, we are all condemned, because throughout the history of humanity, human beings have always been violent.Great movie thanks to a great script very well worked."
1421,1,"Deleted Reviews Make This Site Irrelivant There is no way around saying this movies sucks. At every turn, not just the basics but the characters themselves. If it wasn't for the energy of Bill Skarsgård this movie would be a 0 instead of 1."
1422,10,"Harsh Reviews I really enjoyed this film. Drama and comedy just right. I dont know anything about Eternals in comics before so that kept me watching. Cinematics was great, acting was really good by most actors, storyline simple but interesting. I would say watch it before you judge it."
1423,7,"Its interesting. Not a bad movie, with all superhero movies, this one I know the less, so not sure why low scores, for me it was a very fun movie with a great story, and characters.Visuals like in every marvel movie is great."
1424,3,"I feel bad as a person of indian 😕 I appreciate that in this movie they show some indian culture and this is first time in marvel But too much drama , take good things from us not bad things This movie is below average."
1425,7,"Decent MCU entry with cool creatures and great fights/action! :-) Top-notch visual effects and action choreography! Great cast of actors, and some good character interactions :-). The plot was less relatable to me than other MCU entries :-("
1426,8,Very good movie Uh...well. I will say that I loved the movie ... I was going to rate it 10/10 but two thing made me rate 8/10 . Firstly - there is no villain in the movie and the eternals fight each other .. And why would some of 'em die and some of 'em leave their power . Secondly - marvel didn't did perfect research on the kjngo's character and his entrance dance . The song didn't sound like a Bollywood song and the cars which were standing outside the set were not looking Indian ... I mean the companies ...
1427,1,"Pathetic Casting & Poor Storytelling For the first 40 minutes I had no clue what, why, who, where and again what? The characters are written really badly and the story was a drag at times. The VFX was as good as any Marvels film but everything else was so bad that it doesn't deserve a watch especially the casting. Every single lead was bad. I can't digest Salma Hayek. She's the same person, talking like the same character for more than 2 decades with different clothes. Pathetic. Kunal nanjijkdjdhg should stop acting. I don't know if he is being realistic or sarcastic when he opens his mouth. I don't know if that little girl is actually little or a girl. There is no back story for the characters. I haven't read the comics, so I have no clue what I saw. Why not the next film have al chinese actors only because that's where marvels is headed to.Ikaris character taunts that he doesn't wear a cape when he is mistook for Superman but by watching this film it's clear that he isn't half as powerful as Superman. Why Kit Harrington? He had nothing to do in the entire film. 3-4 wasteful scenes and he was gone. He was better left at the Night's Watch. They could have introduced him in the sequel which I am not interested in. David Kaye's voice as Areshmi was horrible. I couldn't get the dialogues at all. Why hugely built or powerful characters need to have such thick voices? It's like they are grunting gibberish. As I said, pathetic casting. Anyway, Eternal means forever but these characters die like humans.If they could have written this as a series in mind, they could have explained each character and their back stories making us connect with them more, probably. Post Avengers, marvels looks like they are done and dusted.The problem for me began with my OTT - Disney+. The subtitles are either in Indonesian or Malay. Not in English. I had to switch the audio to two other languages at times to get the dialogue. Sometimes the BG music took over the dialogue and sometimes it's just not clear. There were no subtitles for what those non-English speakers were saying nor for that speech impaired girl's sign languages."
1428,8,"Surprised I had low expectations for this. I'm kinda shocked how much I enjoyed it. Kept me interested the whole way through. Good visual fx, not amazing but not super fake looking either. I loved the globe trotting and time spanning stories. A pleasant surprise. Don't understand all the hate for this."
1429,6,"I believe Angelina Joilie is at least a Demi Goddess.. With enough fan belief she can ascend.. Please do not make Madden the new Bond.. There is something insipid and troubling about all the characters he plays, which makes me think it may be his actual personality..That aside, film was worth a watch.. Druig was a standout."
1430,1,"Makes no sense So the celestials are basically gods and Eternals are programmable robots.. so why make them overweight, deaf and children? It makes no sense.Planets are eggs, witch celestials are born from.. why would the eternals ever be made aware of this? It makes no sense.Celestials store and learn from the eternals memories, still makes mistakes and create something flawed after millions of planets and maybe billions of years? Makes no sense.This movie makes no sense, it's just a confusing convoluting dumpsterfire that's 1h too long."
1431,2,"Eternals will return... Disney+ IMAX Enhanced VersionTonally and visually different than the previous MCU installments. As the lowest-rated MCU film in RT, Eternals had some problematic moments that I didn't expected from the Academy Award winning director. Some dialogues were too cheesy or amateurish. I didn't liked most of the performance or dialogue delivery. I think they should've cast actors that know how to act. Faux villains, unnecessarily long runtime about two and a half hours, lackluster direction and the confusing mid and post-credits scenes left me clueless and extremely dissatisfied."
1432,2,"Terrible Can't believe there are some applauding this film, this is a badly made, wooden performance. Two and a half hours long and characters seems disinterested, lifeless and stiff. Why???? That feeling as if you're suspended mid-air and waiting for a freefall but there's nothing, it's just empty.They've put a lot of effort to it, but it's just sad to see how wasteful this is. It's trying hard to be something but terribly failed...couldn't reach it. Why????"
1433,1,"Long, long, long, nonsensical and boring and...long I didn't see Eternals in the theater, but waited for it to stream on Disney+. The wooden performances, so-so CGI and purple dialog made a tedious film experience. The whole Surprise! The gods are really aliens! Thing was much better handles in ""Who Mourns for Adonis?"", a Star Trek episode more than 50 years ago. And it only took an hour."
1434,7,"Where were the Avengers? Where were the Eternals when Thanos attacked, you ask. But we ask: Where were the Avengers when a literal celestial is emerging from Earth?!Superhuman being were sent to Earth thousands of years ago by a god-like being to fulfill the mission of protecting humans against the so-called deviants. Those were destroyed but somehow some deviants were again discovered in present time. Eventually the group of individuals finally discover the true meaning of their mission and their team slowly gets into conflict...This could have been grand but unfortunately it was partly quite boring. The flashbacks were way too lengthy and there were too many scenes were just not much happened. In the end, the resolution was that they somehow - and not too spectacularly - freeze off the celestial. The action is solely provided by the fights against these deviants who really almost have no mind of their own and also do not contribute too much to the story, and by the fight against Superman. Well, not quite Superman, but he is basically Superman, let's be honest. While we're at it, the Flash is amongst the Eternals as well.Visually it was really quite nice and colorful. The post-credits scene was intriguing as they always are in Marvel movies! They have done so much setting up future movies, when will we finally get to the fun part?"
1435,3,"Very poor, boring film I don't enjoy being highly critical, and rarely write reviews - HOWEVER, I was compelled to offer my two cents here because I was blown away by how poorly written and executed this film is. Gifted with a talented cast of actors, it just fails to inspire any emotion in the viewer.In the end, you really just stop caring about what happens to the characters, and indeed the world as a whole in the film. After 30 minutes, I found myself checking how much film was left, in fervent anticipation of the end."
1436,7,Thanos meaning Only after watching the Eternals do i understand Thanos true path. Thanos only tried to safe planet Earth by snapping half of us away. Because it was his way of saving us from a Celestial being born out of our planet. Although I don't believe he understood his path. It was his calling.
1437,6,"Kinda liked it Wasn't expecting to to be honest. There was a some overly boring exposition, during which I was mostly zoning out, and the overall plot was silly and over the top, but a lot of it was in service of creating drama between the characters. And that's what I liked, the characters. I thought most the actors did a good job. Gemma Chan's character was in my opinion the weakest one, after Salma Hayek who I don't like at all as an actress but had a minor roll. Yeah there were giant beings called the celestials, which create and destroy galaxies/life and whatever, but the main conflict was between the Eternals themselves and their beliefs. Also I enjoyed some of the action, which is rare for me when there is so much cgi involved.Still, there are many things that took away from the experience. For example I was confused by Kit Harington and didn't understand why he was in the movie, but spoiler alert, the ending scene was a sequel bait, so I guess we may learn in a few years why this superfluous character was shoehorned in."
1438,7,"NOT THAT BAD. This movie is easily one of the best looking of the MCU. The sheer scope of the project and the backdrops are fiercely beautiful. The characters, while a little underdeveloped were still entertaining and clearly the actors playing them were having a blast. Is it the best Marvel movie? No. But it was a brave addition to the MCU. The saddest thing is the wasted potential. The main problem is that it's too complicated, too much character, too much is happening."
1439,8,"A start for the eternals. Dont rush with prejudgement It was touching and humane, which is good for a superhero movie for a change. The part 2 will bang, now that we now most of them and have a story to hold on to.I dont get why people dont like it, maybe not having big fancy fights for 2 hrs straight or not having the connection with the eternals beforehand, maybe a small 30 minute short movie before the release would have helped."
1440,1,"No thank you There's no if, ands or buts about it, this film was bad.Zhao was completely the wrong choice to direct IMO and as a whole felt just so disconnected. Don't be fooled but the fake 10 reviews."
1441,6,Alright but disappointed at the end Film was good but a bit predictable. Could see where the film was going and how it was setting up future films. But the clip of Harry style playing a character at the end makes me not want to watch any more of them. That's was a bad casting call famous music artists shouldn't be in marvel films it pulls you out of the movie like what the hell. Seriously not watching the next one if that's the direction these films are going in.
1442,1,"Huh.. It's like a horrible mash of marvel and power rangers... I guess this was meant to appeal to 5 year olds. Bad cast, with super powers only a 5 year old could dream up.Learn to write a good story BEFORE you make the movie.. I'm starting to think the movie industry is run by children.To be fair.. the movie wassss made by disney, so I guess it really was made for the underlings but my gosh... disney needs to stay out of making super hero movies, they are truely horrible at it."
1443,4,"What a waste Excellent cast , beautiful visuals, terrible character development , terrible dialogue, character relationships were forced and fake, the jokes weren't funny, the lead character had no depth no layers ... it's just bad."
1444,4,"Didn't like the concept. I didn't know about the comic before watching the movie, I didn't like the whole idea, and the concept that earth was created only to be eventually sacrificed for the birth of a celestial being, and the idea that inventions were a made of eternals not human development."
1445,6,"It was eh I am a long time fan of Marvel everything... this is probably the second worst marvel movie produced (first being captain marvel). This has an amazing cast but the storyline was just not fun/easy to follow. Also, when Gemma falls into a little pool with one of the deviants it looked as if it was a very deep pool, but then after the right she's standing up in it like it was only a foot deep.I'm also a huge fan of Brian Tyree Henry (being from the same city, yay for you man!) but I wish the movie was more fun to watch because he's such an awesome actor.Bill Skarsgaard should not have been the voice to use for the main deviant. Personally Christopher Judge would have been epic."
1446,1,"Uninspired, boring, cringey and dumb. This movie was unhurried, but in a very bad way. Two and a half hours to show what exactly? A story that can be delivered in a couple of sentences without even losing anything important?Every plot point of this movie was dumb as hell, most ""sudden plot twists"" were obvious from the start. Not like I ask much from a Marvel movie, but come on!Characters felt weird and had no chemistry at all. There were a lot of jokes, but I havent smiled once in a whole movie."
1447,3,"Disappointing I was waiting for so long for this movie I got to 43 minutes and stopped. Then an hour later, I decided I would give it a chance and finish it, hoping it was going to get better A waste of time. The actors looked bored and had no affect in their voice. Its longggg and has lots of emply space A 4 is kind on my part. I could have shut it down again, but my husband told me he wanted to see the end. Borrrrring."
1448,7,"7,5 actually, not bad at all.. I get now why people hated that movie and they still do BUT come on... It's something new, it was about time for marvel to try different characters. Nice visuals and acting, a little slow in the beginning but turns out well. 3,5/5 stars."
1449,4,"Only for the special effects. The special effects are brilliant as usual with anything Marvel. As for the movie. What was I watching. It wasn't fresh, it didn't appeal to the sole generation and it was a comic book movie. Just a mess of a script, poorly acted with the laziest writing of a script. This makes Captain Marvel look like a revelation. Also the superman reference. Just no point. This is bad. Really really bad. I've paused it at least five times to check my phone etc. Oh and the inappropriate sexual scene was just not what the MCU is about. So out of place. Story 1/10. Effects 5/10. Acting 2/10."
1450,1,"Worst MCU film till date. This film the WORST MCU film I've seen so far.It gives the most stupid reason for why The Eternals never interfere in human conflict, why they never fought in New York, never fought in Sokovia, didn't do anything when Thanos wiped out half the universe.Reason: They were secretly paving the way for the Emergence.Phastos paved the way for human innovation NOT HUMANS!This movie does a lot of explaining and shows very little. Also, the pacing of the film makes very boring to watch.The wedding of Sersi and Ikaris takes place in India during the Gupta Period. It's an Indian wedding and they are KISSING each other. This goes to show how little the writers actually thought about the culture, religion, and civilization as a whole.There is a scene in the film where Phastos's son calls Ikaris ""Superman"". So he reads DC Comics. According to that logic he must have read Marvel comics as well. Why would why read a comic that has characters who read comics? Why would I invest myself in a story that reminds me that I'm reading a story?And don't why marvel focuses so much on humor that even in the action sequences I don't feel scared for the characters at all.The CGI in the film is so bad I can easliy tell which sequence is real and which is fake. That's one of the problems with Marvel that it relies too much on Visual Effects. Everything is FAKE!"
1451,7,"Worth the wait...almost! Just finished watching on Disney+, and I enjoyed it but there's a but!Visually the film is stunning from start to finish. The CGI is brilliant, and come on Angelina Jolie whielding any weapon her imagination can conjure...amazing! The cast is fantastic too, and they all get their time to shine.Unfortunately the story is just slow, and there's too much having to be explained for you to feel anything for the characters.I think the biggest problem is that Marvel are trying to introduce a new ensemble cast without the audience having a chance to love the characters before (like we were able to with Iron Man, Thor, Cap, Black Widow etc. Before The Avengers). There's 11 new characters here being introduced in a 2.5 hour film!!I do think however now that we ""know"" the characters and some of the background it could make for an incredible series of films. ..especially as I'm a huge fan of the cosmic storylines (GOTG is still the best!).So 7 out of 10 as it gave us some good foundations for the future...just too much in 1 film!"
1452,9,"surprisingly amazing Much better then i expected. I hope it's Marvels true form. This is exactly what movie about Gods should look like. Love how they captured drama of Olimpian Gods and finally put it to cosimc scale. Yes there was no real characters to connect to, but in my book this is very close to perfect movie about Gods. Looked amazing ,loved the story ,what more do you want.Cast was a bit strange IMHO. Hard to even tell what exactly was off. But something was. On anaouncment was surprised with Jolie name, but after seing the character - perfect casting there. Really want more."
1453,1,"Iraq has no ocean! And no one spoke Arabic in Babel 5000 years ago!! The worst marvel movie ever! Actually one of the biggest disappointments in recent history!I'm not going to talk about the shallow characters, poor dialogue and useless looong scenes!I want to mention some very small points that proves no one even tried to do their job!1- Mr. Super god who made everything , really looks like a very big failure, since everything he designed got out of his control!2- The great scientist-eternal who ""helped us"" improve our technologies did think for 7000 years to compare his own body to human bodies or try know anything about his own nature...great scientific thinking!3- Why no one explained what Mr. Super God chooses to create an eternal who can't speak and another who is an eternal child!?4- There is no ocean in Iraq...not even a sea!5- 3000 BC the Egyptians were building pyramids but the movie focus on Babel as if it's the oldest city in the history... which is not true at all!This movie is so bad that doesn't deserve to be compared to anything other than a B-grade movie!"
1454,9,"One of the best movies I have seen recently! For me its pure ""documentary"" with great story, with very good visuals and thats it. I know, I feel and understand everything whats in the movie. I loved the pace, the story and visuals. Only downside is that it was too short."
1455,9,"Clever and representative First of all, pardon my English as it is not my first language.I found this movie really sapiosexual-friendly. It's really satisfying to see the director using the vast history of human activity as plot devices and they all fit into the story organically.The dynamics among the cast in this movie are also so rare to be found in other movies, not even in indie movies, let along a blockbuster.Really can't believe this is a superhero movie."
1456,5,"Eternals' strife An excellent start, but changes to a bore with behavior we've seen in humans, followed by action, but no satisfaction. Too long a movie with continuous disagreement throughout and what's it all about? To save the world or not. Just another Marvel movie, with good CGI, but otherwise a poor story."
1457,3,"Below any expectation I had. I was so looking forward to watching this movie only to be so disappointed, how they could mess up a movie with potential to be so good.Some acting choices where good with potential to have been great but Salma was a extremely poor choice as was the the Indian guy that was the worst choice of actor and character and should never have been cast in. This movie as a superhero nor comedian.Angelina could've made this movie with a better script and storyline even close to tomb raider.There is so much wrong with this movie and wish I didn't waste over two hours watching it (I actually wish I walked out after the first 15. Minutes).Extremely poor in everyday."
1458,10,Great movie! For me it is a great movie because it opened up more marvel stories. Fights may lack of action especially with deviant vs thena but the story was quite good.
1459,1,"Why does it have to be Earth everytime.... Like everyone else says, it has some interesting premise but pacing and story is just all over the place.In the end, it is a boring movie with some repeated scenes. How many times do they have to introduce the characters all over again...Maybe as an individual movie is alright but when combined with the same universe as iron man, it gets bit too much."
1460,1,"What utter rubbish I missed this on the big screen as it had mixed reviews and finally watched it yesterday and wow what a terrible film, slow, rubbish characters, rubbish plot, just very uninteresting and for a marvel film it's the worse by a huge distance."
1461,9,"It's awesome ignore criticizers Everyone is saying that it's worst movie but ignore them have your own experience. This movies has many unexpected twists, few are disappointing but overall this movie is nice."
1462,3,"Big nope for me I've never rooted for the bad guys to win so much while watching this 2,5 hour monster of a movie.Some actors seem out of place in this movie. The story is all over the place. Special effects are sometimes really well and sometimes just plain awful.The title is spot on though. It felt like an eternity."
1463,10,"Loved It What can I say about this movie It was fantastic everything about it was great, if you enjoy marvel you'll absolutely love this it's a ride. The acting is good the story is great the special effects mind blowing the costumes amazing each actor played there part with authenticity, I'd definitely watch it again, you won't be disappointed."
1464,6,"So disappointing The visuals were great, the action was epic and the casting looks fun. For me this one of the most beautiful looking MCU movie ever made. Now there are a lot of awful problems in this film. The story about the family reunion felt too long, too many characters, confusing plot, the villain was bland and the heroes doesn't even act like a hero at all. There are some great moments in this film but some of the moments felt flat. This is an example of where this project could've turn into a mini series instead.Verdict: 6.9/10."
1465,3,"a mess Uninteresting characters and sub par acting. This was a movie where I felt truely bored. Maybe this movie was in production hell, but man this was pretty bad.3/10: bad."
1466,3,"Lacking Fair to say this is a direct entry into the bottom three in my list of MCU films because it's ultimately just... bleh.It does have some nice touches and the usual bits (CGI and Cinematography) that are fantastic but it's just a bit too self aware and stuck in a Twenty-First Century American morality for its own good. There are jokes, not good ones and not many of them but they are there albeit you need to know why its amusing to see Kit Harrington and Richard Madden constantly saying ""I love you"" to a character called Sersi, although constantly using her name to drive it home does make it less and less amusing with each iteration to the point that it's less of a joke and more of a justification for why both of them got their roles that's up there with Ed Sheeran's appearance in Red Notice.You may be asking yourself why the better actor got the smaller of the two roles, I was until the Ebon Blade was artlessly dropped into conversation late on in the film and then made the connection but I really dont see the standalone film coming to make either choice a worthwhile one.For everyone else except Gemma Chan, they were all just delighted to get into the MCU either for the money or the prestige but part of the conditions for such a deal is signing up before you read the script which explains Angelina Jolie's completely phoned in performance for her small amount of screen time.The story is fractured more than suffering from holes, it's trying to be set in history while completely ignoring the values and natures of those times. The most glaring of these is embodied in Sprite, played really very well by Lia McHugh. Even if she was as described on wikipedia, as having the appearance of a 12 year old girl, her frustration at not being able to find love would only have been an issue for the last century and even then only in the West, barely the blink of an eye to a 7000 year old celestial being especially when you consider she's one that can, as seen in the opening scene, project an aged appearance when needed. If after all this time she still has the emotional maturity of a preteen, making her human is not going to make her grow up except physically and losing all that power, and facing mortality is going to make her a basket case before she finds anyone to murder in their shared bed.Then you have the climate change denial by dint of explaining it away as the planet heating up from the inside, murder justified by belief in Gods plan that's never actually called out as wrong, mental illness being treated by moving the person suffering away from everyone and not even attempting to understand or do anything actually helpful, and why would an all powerful being create a super soldier that can only receive orders and give information when they have a clear line of sight?I honestly cant tell if the film was written by a right wing committee or one from the left, maybe both were involved and then some poor bugger had to fill in the gaps and failed so that after almost three hours you come out with a story that feels unfinished and disjointed, you can look to individual aspects like the performances by GC and LMcH, the expertly choreographed fight sequences and the grand scale of it but as a combined unit it just falls flat, it's not even average overall, just a bit rubbish, and for a studio like Marvel, that's just not good enough."
1467,1,"Worst Marvel Movie so far (and that from a fan) 1 A actress visibly NOT enjoying her job, a hand full of B actors, story waaaaay off reality ( I liked that about Marvels Flicks, the right distance to reality not to be absurd) and the somewhat futile attempt to connect to the MU by mentioning the Avengers and Thanos once or twice aren't enough to make for an entertaining film. Forced myself to watch half of it, then I jumped forward with 10 min steps to see an unsatisfactory end. Please Marvel, we've seen you guys doing A LOT better. FYI: First time ever I wrote a review. Felt somehow compelled to do so in this case. It was really, really bad..."
1468,10,"What a masterpiece! Truth about Religion! Don't pay attention to anyone with low rates reviews, I am sure they are religion overzealous. Besides the cinematic and special effects this movie is a philosophy of religion and how was formed or invented. This movie has a subtle way to send specific message about those self made Gods and how it's possible all began and run through history. This movie, without spelling directly, shows what religion and worshipping meant. This movie is a masterpiece by exactly showing that message. We see the influence of so called Gods in human history in so many cultures and civilizations. This movie represents the prove we needed for why and how we believe in a superior being. This movie its, by itself, an affront for all those ignorants who believe blindly in something far more advanced that human civilization. It defines God in another way."
1469,7,"Not flawless, but it's enjoyable. Although it has some confusion and I didn't understand some parts, it's not that bad. At least it's kind of enjoyable and I have completely enjoyed.Can't wait to see the next film."
1470,1,"Trash The whole film sempt rushed, heavily re edited, and downright bad, the writing in this film is absolutely garbage, I'd sooner watch Tommy Wiseaus ""The Room"" 10x over, before re watching this Trash.The only good part about this movie is how they accurately approached the speed girls CGI, and Running fluid through scenes. The Speed Running in this film does it 10 times better than DC ever did with any Flash project. Shame, that's all I enjoyed about this film."
1471,1,"One of the worst Marvel movies I have ever watched Huge Marvel fan but this movie outright sucked. Horrible writing, and directing. Unnecessary flashbacks and funny skits when not needed.P.s. You know a film is bad when the dialogue literally explains everything that's happening or is about to happen.I wish I could give this a 0/10. Give me my time back."
1472,10,"Fantastic movie This movie is fantastic its VFX,storyline,characters and enemy. This movie has some kissing scenes so marvel has not involve in this but accept this all things is epic."
1473,5,"What can you say?? Waste of talent and money There's a huge effort gone into making this movie, millions and millions and millions of dollars. But for what? Another deeply unsatisfying CGI monster movie about 'super heroes'? Take that money and go cure a disease or two, solve world hunger and really do something super heroic.Someone somewhere at Marvel/Disney needs to say STOP. Stop until there's something actually worth making as opposed to what just seems to be a mandate to get more 'product' out the door. This movie is all flash and little substance. I feel it adds little or nothing to the MCU.I watched this movie with subtitles (because it was night time and I didn't want to disturb the rest of the house). When you read the dialogue it's really not well written (sorry script writers!). There's a lot of extraneous talk, and I don't know if anyone else noticed (or were too bothered tbh) the beatification of 'primitive' cultures with many scenes of costumed 'superheroes' appearing to be angelic while braiding little urchins hair or doling out magic crystals. Or something like that.It's just a poor movie from storyline perspective and I was very disappointed with the outcome here. It's an extremely saccharine messaged plot line with no real substance.One day Feige and his crew will (like the first Iron Man) put their non Avenger superhero stable into a good - reality based - detective story and get rid of fire monsters and supreme cosmic entities. We've had enough."
1474,8,"Fresh start and can't wait for the end. Enjoyed this very much, got a bit slow in the beginning but picked the pace and was exiting through out. The post credit scenes made me wish for more sequels. Graphics effects and CGIs were beautiful, fighting sequences were beautiful and introduced new elements. Performances though with few dialogues were great with perfect cinematographies. Highly recommended and can't wait to see how the story develops from the sequels."
1475,6,"Terrible Casting I had to watch this 3 separate times , I usually can watch any movie on one sitting. I suppose I just had to not give up even tho Salma Hyak is one of the most annoying actresses of all time and not even a good one either. And Don't get me started on Angelina Jolie. Both of them are definitely DC mistake characters but come on MCU. I suppose they are running out of actors."
1476,7,"Good, But could be great Interested to see them return, but this move falls short on explaining and showing their relationships with humans in the past. Was hoping to see them befriending someone important to our history. Also feel the love dynamic was extremely confusing and shallow only meaning sersi and ikari's relationship and why she was so quick to not care about the other dude. Lmao he looked like a complete simp, but the visuals were great. It just felt a little empty in the beginning, but definitely something to give another go."
1477,7,It was interesting Maybe if angelina jolly had more dialogue and directing was beter.I hope they change director for next movie.Actors could do better.But it was good for first episode.
1478,1,"Couldn't get through it Paid to see it in cinema... (myself + teenager + tween). Have seen every other Marvel movie, generally a huge fan... but this one was so boring we left 3/4 of the way through. 😴"
1479,7,"Not bad really Overall its not a bad movie in anyway esp if you have never even read the comics. But its far from the best no doubt. The score and the visuals on display were great as was majority of the fightscenes. It heavily suffers from the lack of a solid lead character but the supporting cast does their job to cover it the best they can. A decent setup for the future and a commendable introduction of the Celestials, Deviants and the Eternals to the MCU.Far from the worst the MCU has to offer but not top10 material either. A little more color, soul and respect for its source could've really helped the movie stand out.RATING: 6.5/10 (obviously deducting points for not honoring the creation and vision of Jack Kirby)"
1480,1,Seriously... why? Why would anyone finance this garbage? This is pure failure on every front. If you had anything to do with producing this road apple please just stop and find yourself another profession.
1481,7,"Not best of mcu but nice flick I personally refused to bother to accept all the negative opinions i've heared but after all i liked it ,no doubt it is not the best of mcu but it is nice and enjoyable specially the acting of casts really kept me in line to this flick it is actually in different gener to those of mcu movies released before besides of its super hero gener it also brings epic fantasy and adventures moments to the audience i personally liked it i recommend it don't think about the unfair rating it already got on other sites and judge by ur own perspective and am glad asequel is on the way ,"
1482,10,One of the most versatile movies of MCU There is a mix of different cultures from all around the globe. A nice hidden villain of the plot you might say who is hiding in the plain sight as the Hero. That was a good twist to the plot. And how each individual eternal stick to their belief. This is a nice creative movie in my opinion. Was great fun watching.
1483,5,"The worst Marvel film I've seen The production is fine, but it's a long, tough and frustrating watch because of the number of plot holes and legitimate questions that won't go away. If the Eternals aren't permitted to interfere with human development, what exactly was their job for thousands of years? They don't DO anything except fight the Deviants (whose origin and purpose is as unclear as everything else). With a timeline of millennia, the writers could have gone deep, gothic or prophetic and linked the Eternals with characters or events from Egyptian, Greek or biblical mythology. If the 'emergence' is directly related to global population numbers, they could have made Thanos' 'snap' THE event that interrupted this process and forced the Eternals into action. Instead of any of this, we are presented with a group of weak, unknown characters who just seem to be aimlessly floating alongside humanity (and the MCU) with no clear, grounded purpose. Add to this lots of dialogue, clunky exposition with only a couple of jokes that land and Eternals is a flat, static wasted opportunity. I could write something more interesting than this using only a set of Tarot cards for inspiration."
1484,9,"A lot of ppl are spoiled by marvel I dont know why so manjy ppl are giving bad reviews, i gues cause Marvel made so high scale and expectation, and i gues those who doesnt know marvels stories, and just watch their movies cause they are good, gave bad reviews to this one.Very good movie, its true its a lot to put in this movie, but overall they did a good job."
1485,1,Horrible from the first second to the last LMAO should have spent the money you wasted on these has been actors and the CG to make them look like they can do a flip in the air on better writers. Would have been better to have no named actors with some actual talent have a shot at those roles instead of these clowns who prolly paid to be in a marvel movie so they could try to stay relevant in popularity. It wasn't even worth watching for free.
1486,3,"It's like watching a computer game... I should have expected this when I saw the word 'Marvel' at the beginning.It was like watching a VERY long Unreal engine 5 demo. Everything was obviously done in front of a green screen. I am not entirely sure whether the actors were even wearing costumes as their heads just didn't seem to connect convincingly. I.e. Their heads seemed super-imposed on computer generated costumes.Where was the real story? You need time to create a background/foundation the story, not a couple of paragraphs at the beginning, that is just lazy. Like all Marvel films there was no real character development with endless patchy fight scenes and explosions leaving plenty opportunities to go to the toilet without missing anything important, exciting or relevant.When will Marvel realise that a good film has one maybe two protagonists, not 10+. The more you have the more 'diluted' the story becomes.Definitely one for the very young children who like to imagine it is them with super-powers. I want 2hrs 40mins of my life back!"
1487,4,Eternal rubbish Marvel - What where you thinking??? By far the worst Marvel film I have seen... Poor plot trying too hard to use too many special effects. Bring back the Avengers PLEASE!!!
1488,5,"Watchable but nothing to brag about! Honestly, watch this once to satisfy your curiosity but don't expect much in return. Like an ex lover, you made the mistake once and once is enough to learn from your mistakes and move onto greener pastures. Same same but different!For starters, they (Eternals) were given instructions not to interfere in human conflict, simply get rid of this alien pest thats eating humans! Yet their very existence on earth and making themselves known to humans is an interference on its own. Especially the fact they arrived in a space ship and these cave dwellers hadnt even invented or discovered a knife it seems. Hmmmmm not strange at all."
1489,2,Scattered. Boring AF. Way too long. Why? Who likes this crap? When did we forget how to make a movie with characters who mean something...or plots that make sense? This is TOTAL CRAP.You have been warned.
1490,2,"Can I help you get under the desk? !!! Yep ... When that line ( and its not much worse than the others ) comes out of a teacher / superheroes mouth, you know a writer wasn't involved in this flop ... Its just a sprawling mess that jumps around through time and narrative with no rhyme or reason ... The cast look about as engaged as if they were at a wedding they had to be at, so as to not upset their parents ... There's monsters and explosions but nothing new or interesting ... And what a waste of Ma Dong-seok who has been one of my favourite actors in the last few years Who on earth thought Chloe Zhao would be a good idea to direct a superhero film should be fired immediately ... Of course she also has her name top of the writers credits so she is very much responsible for this rubbish ... ""Nomadland"" was nice little film ... Its BIG ( slightly over sized ) heart was in the right place, which is rare in american films ... But it was not a ""good"" film ... It was rather flat ... The only reason it won prizes was due to another great performance from Frances McDormand ... The directing lacked flair and style, which was what the film needed admittedly, but showed no great flair ... To put the director of that on to a film like this was supposed to be is insane ... But that's hollywood... If you manage to sit through this garbage, I can guarantee you won't bother a second time ... Bottom of the barrel money and time waster."
1491,4,"boring irrelevant drama Plagiarism mixed with cringe. Most scenes unnecessary had to convince myself a few times to carry on watching. Script fit for a child's viewing only.. do t question anything, its magic, they ain't gotta explain sheet. Don't waste your time, unless you're incredibly bored and have taken acid."
1492,3,"Was really nice....., .....,to see Famke Janssen back? On her stomach cream for ice scream. Swear this movie took a piece from everything else and crammed into a two....,hmm? Jolie B-List sting, now? Anywhat? Great for the fat family.....,"
1493,3,"Saving the world again... You know, when every single Marvel movie seems to be about saving the earth from certain destruction. And you know that the good guys are going to do it, because what? They aren't? Its hard to care.Add to that, that Disney has sunk its mediocre claws into the Marvel ecosystem and you get The Eternals. Immaculate production values surrounding a weak, weak story.Oh, and they all the good guys hate each other and hardly come across as any kind of team. You know, until the very end. Haven't seen that before. Having to go through an hour plus of them squabbling with each other, or geting all moon eyed at one another. Its just too much.As well, I wasn't very impressed with the talent that they got for this production. 10 out of 10 for diversity in all fields. But does that help tell a good story? Or does it keep producers from getting pilloried on Twitter? Go through the Trivia section of this page and look at all the A-listers that they considered for roles and then look at who they chose instead. They saved a bundle on salaries I guess.The only super hero movie I've enjoyed lately was Thor: Ragnorok, and that's because it makes fun of itself and the whole genre. It doesn't take itself so seriously.Superhero movies are played out. Stick a fork in them, they're done."
1494,3,"Boring This movie has to be one of the most boring movies I have seen for ages. The plot is dull, very little humour, and the characters basically have no story arc.I could not care less in the end."
1495,1,Bad The movie just sucks in every way but visuals. The characters are wired and it had a +18 scene while it's a pg13 movie like wtf.and everything else is bad.
1496,2,"Eternals ...Meh A torturous mess , too much monkey business and too long, not enough empathy for anyone with a brain, all the other negative reviews lean toward not so good as the Hype for this production...still maybe like other Disney Turkeys it will become a classic for the next generation."
1497,9,"Don't listen to anyone that didn't Like this movie It was beautifully done. Excellent acting, brilliant theological thoughts and ideas, great CGI effects, wonderful story.Great directing, and if I am honest, I was so involved with the story, I didn't realize the music, which says something, it enhanced but didn't overpower.I will look forward to anything directed by Chloe in the future."
1498,1,"Best Marvel movie Eh-VAh! It has got to win Best Picture at the Oscars!Swooshing glowing alien golden crop circles galore, human eating monsters, elves, and Bollywood dance scenes intermissions in one picture! A dream comes true. Kit Harington (Jon Snow) and Richard Madden (Robb Stark) back on screen together! I am totally floored. It even has Harish Patel, umm, yeah...anyway. Ma Dong-seok too, uhh, errr, moving along. Salma Hayek does a great impression of a green planking Jalapeno, that's talent. Angelina Jolie as the mentally unstable warrior kicking butt, so what if she attacks her own crew.Can't wait to see the 94th Academy Awards ceremonies, WooHoo!Seriously, the mouse is really finger-snapping Thanos."
1499,1,"Disappointing, very weak indeed... Poor, boring plot. A poor performance for Marvel. I expected more, but unfortunately it didn't meet my expectations. Disappointing, nothing like Marvel movies."
1500,5,"Dont waste your time Wow...30mins in and am still wondering if I will wakeup. Totally boring, over hyped Disney production as per Disney star wars movies. It's so slow, dreary, and to pull this off it appears they need a have GOT cast lineup."
1501,9,"Lore-packed MCU blockbuster This movie is for you, if you like reading wikia and fandom pages more than playing through an action game, simply because you're only interested in the lore. There's a lot of world building going on, much more so than in other MCU movies, and on par with the likes of Loki. The visuals are very, very bare. Most of the movie takes place in deserts and volcanic islands, with no background actors in sight. The superhero visuals are also minimalistic, take the Flash from DC and his different representations in cinematography, you'll find the speedster here blends into the surroundings a lot more, which is a very interesting take on a speedster, arguably more believable. The shortfall of Eternals was the treatment of Deviants, they were never more important to the plot than the buzzing of flies in your ear.The main conflict, as with many of the phase 4 media, lies between morally ambiguous choices, and the protagonist has to pay a price for either of those choices, only the future can tell if it was worth it. There are only a few connections to current or previous MCU releases, so you might want to start with this, if you want to enter the MCU."
1502,6,"Eternally long Nothing particularly bad here, but also nothing particularly compelling. A movie based on a comic book that was not overly successful. Could have easily cut 40 minutes with good editing.After an interesting build up with the deviants that entire subplot ends in a hurry as if the writers didn't know what to do with it.I suppose the premise is that fabricated externals become more human as they live amongst humans but the director took a long time to get there repeatedly beating it into the audience.Some Marvel movies just don't bear a second viewing and this is one of them."
1503,6,"ReWatch it at 1.6x Speed!! The movie is so slow and drawn out that when you change the playback speed to 1.6x, it makes a terrible movie actually watchable.They speak so slow in the movie that increasing the playback speed makes it sound normal!And increasing the playback speed takes the fight scene way up and they actually look like superheros!!"
1504,5,"Visually Pleasing, but felt like a Disney movie Put this one with Captain Marvel and Dark Phoenix. The visuals were nice. Wasn't a fan of the villain monsters. Didn't connect with any characters. Movie felt like it was made for 11-14 year olds."
1505,3,"""Eternals will return""..... Please for the love of MCU, don't. Poor writing, worse editing, horrible directing.Actings decent given the pile of menour they had to work with.CGI good until credit scene No1. An you all know what i mean.This we (atleast i) do not need in the MCU.I want to erase it from my mind. Where a man in black when you need one?"
1506,4,"wasted potential Lol it made no sense.. they do not interfere in mortal issues ok.. but when Thanos came they did not interfere because humans needed to fend for themselves... what? And like some mentioned... thanos offing half the universe would go 100% against what arishan wanted for this planet lol... a planet full of people to give birth to a celestial.. so very weak reasoning to make them come out of nowhere..should have gone with Iron man finger snap killing thanos and reviving people that maybe got killed by him centuries ago for example..anyway, story was slow paced by a mile.. could have done everything in90 minutes.But that is what you get when you try to fit too many characters.. do you guys remember all their names? I already forgot.. indian dude, jolie, ikaris and the japanese girl would have been enough, ok the black dude to create the tools... the mind controling and the flash were not necessary.Make them feel like they were protectors.. give the plot twist and of course fight to save the world... ikaris as a traitor... nah.. that was lame at least they did not kill all the male dudes and make the females invincible war machines."
1507,10,"It really is a family drama with superheroes as a backdrop It's refreshing to see a superhero movie not all about sci fi background, more about a family struggle and conflict in their ideology, something that very real these days."
1508,4,"what a let down I'm writing this as I watch the film as its so fasr failed to hold much of my attention, the story just seems to be made up as it goes along with very little main plot and a majority of the actors/actresses are so flat even they seem to have given up.I read in the trivia this is a ""perfect transition"" ....really! Transitioning from what?.. ok, they try by mentioning Thanos and the blip a few times and always come back with ""we can not interfere"" yet most of the movie seems to be them interfering, make your mind up Marvel!Some of the graphics and fight scenes are pretty good and the fight choreography from Angelina Jolie is amazing, this had some great potential and just let its self down in my opinion, i belive there will be a sequel so hopefully they can improve.One last thing, just got to the end and now its totally ruined... Harry Styles! WTF! Marvel have a great pedigree of proper actors and new comers, then they put him in i, there has to be better options!"
1509,8,"Beautifully shot and very entertaining Yes, it has some clichés and I'd loved to have seen some characters explored in other ways. But I think it fulfills the premise and it's a very well done deliverance on loss, love and free will. Hopefully there will be a sequel."
1510,10,TERRIBLY UNDERRATED! After all the fan bickering about this movie I'll be honest I didn't go in with much hope in this movie but it turned out to be quite a surprise.the visuals are unlike anything seen previously in the mcu.
1511,5,"Different Not Marvels best, but certainly not the worst. The biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. This is worth watching and has some redeeming elements but is up there with Captain Marvel as one of the worst films from the Marvel universe in some time."
1512,9,just watched I thought the story line was great Cant wait too see were this goes from here has a great spoiler for whats to come at the end with harry stylesWell done marvel.Watched with the family great movie.
1513,9,"What's with the bad reviews? I am quite surprised finding so many bad reviews. Certainly the movie has a few flaws - sometimes with the special effects, sometimes with the acting of certain actor, sometimes with the dialog. - they are few and can easily be ignored. Still its far better than many other marvel movies. It has quite an intriguing storyline, some strong character building, a very nice emotional touch, also gravity. This could be better of course - but still i loved it and will be among my favorite marvel movies.Personally, I always feel adding unnecessary humor and jokes completely destroys the urgency of a situation - ultimately the movie. Movies like shang-chi, aquaman have great action sequence. But what they mostly lack is that i cannot 'feel' those movies. Completely losing oneself inside the story is what a movie should be. There are many marvel and dc (except snyder's) movies that i never watch more than once bcz they dont offer nothing but cgi and pointless jokes. Eternals tried to be much different in that aspect.And those who complaining about the runtime, when u're introducing 10 characters in a single movie - u should expect that would take time do it properly. And chloe jhao did it nicely. Loving and understanding the characters is what gives a movie a 'memory'."
1514,3,"What The Hell Was That About?? Bad characters chosen, bad dialogues, bad acting, bad Creatures and on the top of that a bollywood song? Really? I have nothing against bollywood but in a millions of dollars movie so much bad factors. Sorry marvel but it is a disappointment."
1515,1,"Worse Marvel's movie ever Hope is my new TV, but this movie is indeed an absolutely crap.It's the worse Marvel's movie ever made. Even famous actors are as expressive as zombie in some very low budget movie.Only credible part is the Bollywood scene..."
1516,6,"Not all MCU movies can be top The six stars are due to the battle scenes and to Makkari and Druig.I liked how a famous star who plays only leading roles in movies like Angelina Jolie doesn't have as many lines and only her struggle with memories is focused.I love Salma Hayek, but not only were there a few lines here, but I also felt superfluous in her role.Still, it hurt when they killed Ajak and Gilgamesh (Don Lee), who, by the way, somehow felt he was properly connected to Tina.About Sprite, why she had to be in love with Ikaris, who annoyed me throughout the movie, and not because he supported the plan.Phastos was well made, Kingo could have three ideas more fun, Sersi had to be more confident.The main love affair was wrong, Ikaris and Sersi were annoying, it was awkward to watch their love scenes.And I don't want to offend, but Harry Styles' choice is a bit strange, it seems more like Marvel's marketing strategy to make the film more popular because they know the script is flat and feels unfinished. Still, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for him to develop it better than the other characters here.As for them, I think it means that Marvel has to bring back the slain Eternal, because we want to see a team of superheroes saving the world, not a group of robots with forces obtained from a big red giant, who are fighting each other. And in addition to the idea, develop more Ajak, Kingo and the relationship between Makkari and Druig, show the new life of Sprite, but keep Angelina's character the same, because among all these passions of the characters, I think Jolie provides a pretty balanced relationship in the ""team"".I would like to point out that there is a mixture of quite different characters. Different points of view, etc.In general, this is not a superhero film, but a film about misunderstandings, conflicts, values and understandings on a topic (even if it is saving the world).As soon as the Eternals return, they need more comedy (which they are trying to put in here, but they didn't succeed) (for the record, many of the characters have the potential to make better jokes)), more battles that they already, get good and better script FOR GOD!"
1517,1,"So average Something just isn't right with this film not sure what or maybe it's everything. The acting was way below the standard I'd expect it's was truly wooden times. Casting was just a joke, cgi was amateur at times. Writing was sooo basic and predictable. Should have let eternals stay out of MCU. Please don't make another."
1518,1,"One of the worst Marvel movie ever I find this very poor movie and the way it started and when it started to be a little bit interested is one hour later. But still the director of this movie need to find a new job. And also for Metascore, I follow you many times but sometimes I don't unders stand the score. 52 points I find it first it will reach 30 points. Sing 2 is more fun, more story and wonderful story from the beginning till the end and you give it a lower score than this movie, unbelievable."
1519,4,"Yet another Disney Movie! They did seem to make something of an effort, albeit a small one, to show they don't just do stuff for kids now... it may also have had something to do with the MCU.Couldn't quite get myself to sit through the whole thing, I may try again in the future, what I saw might be worth 4 stars.I am holding out hope for a couple of the other upcoming titles under Disney but that hope is tenuous at best."
1520,3,"Stop using a Dead Cat The fact that this film was review bombed before it even came out was more than enough proof that sifting through public opinion would be a nightmare.The film isin't bad because it has a lot of diversity. Let's just get that out the way right out the gate.The film is bad for soooo many reasons, and none of them have anything to do with the gender, race, sexuality and creed of the cast and crew. But whenever you try and criticise this film, suddenly all logical reason is thrown out the window to scream ""You hate diversity"". No, I hate this film.It is poorly written, poorly paced, full of vapid characters and bland cgi. The visuals are so fake and computerised that you feel like your watching a camera demo and not a film. The villains are lack luster and bland (introduced in a text block in the opening scene) and killed off with 0 credence, there are so many characters who don't get any development or time to shine and yet the film IS TWO HOURS AND FOURTY MINUTES LONG. How does a film have too much and not enough time. Bad writing, that's why. And the humour... oh god. Marvels attempts at humour are hit and miss. Sometimes they are good for a chuckle or two, and sometimes they fall flat on their face (at the best of times) and at the worst of times, completely undercut any tension in the scene. They have branded the technique of packing so many into a film that at least some will land, but this film... is just so horrendously unfunny.And why wasn't this a series? 1 episode for each eternal being introduced and than a big finale with all of them. You can't cram that many characters into a bland generic plot and expect people to give a hoot.And the after credit scenes. Don't even bother.It's a pointless entry into the series that contributes so very little and is so mind numbling boring that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Do not watch this film.And once again, it has nothing to do with the cast's race or sexuality. Stop using that dead cat tactic to avoid real critisism. It's a bad film. End of."
1521,2,"This was rough Feels like it was written by children. Actual children, I'm not even trying to be hyperbolic. Marvel spent years making me invested in the MCU and now it has come to this. I don't think I have it in me to continue this ride anymore."
1522,2,"Easily the worst part of the MCU I never thought they would make an MCU movie I never want to see more than once but here it is. This isn't entertainingly bad but is so meh you'll wonder why it was ever made. This was the first time during a movie I actually saw people walk out of the theater in the middle and never return.What did eternals do right? The cg was gorgeous, some of the outer space shots were some of the nicest cg I've ever seen...... and that's it.What did eternals do wrong? The Story, nothing exceptional and told poorly. The eternals first come across as basically rat catchers fighting really big rats. The twists in the story really don't improve on this level of blandness. The main characters were mostly flat and lifeless, even the two love interests felt as if they had no affection or attraction for each other. The side characters came across as the most interesting parts of the story and they only showed up briefly. Character growth was both forced (character thinks a in flashback, now thinks b but no reason given) and non-existent (both a and b are basically the same thing anyways) at the same time. I've heard people say this would do better as a series, maybe it would, but it wasn't. The choreography was also pretty boring, feeling more like watching two old men with flashlights shining them at each other until one of them falls down with just enough variety to show that the characters have different skills, not a single fight felt entertaining or strategic, just sort of there to sandwich the parts where the characters have to speak in an attempt to stop you from realizing how boring everything they said was.It reminded me most of the inhumans tv series, but the inhumans was still better than this in that it had stronger overall cast. Eternals was not quite crap but if it wasn't mcu there would be no one really wanting to see it, not the worst thing I saw in 2021, just the second worst. Even Aquaman was more interesting to watch. There was no sense of fun anywhere in the movie and I hope they will just let the eternals disappear and put their resources towards better projects."
1523,1,This movie is boring The main characters defining trait is thats she's kind. That's it. We're never given any other information about her other than that she's kind. The plot is unfocused and boring.
1524,1,"This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. This movie did not have good pacing. It has way too many flashbacks that spoon feed us a story that doesn't have a point. There's way so many characters that the movie doesn't have enough time to flesh out... any of them. At no point do you believe these characters have spent thousands of years together, they lack chemistry. That's due to stale dialogue but also bad writing. A lot of the characters are so bland or absent for a lot of the movie that i literally dont care if the villains win when they fight. Plus it's a marvel movie so the pending doom feels saturday morning cartoonish and inconsequential. The premise of the movie is interesting but its bogged down by two other plots that dont need to be in the movie. The whole plot of the movie revolves around the characters moral struggle with their role as protectors of the earth, but some of the most interesting characters in the movie... dissappear for 70% of the movie. Some of the characters dissapear and theres never an explanation for why they chose to sit out. This movie shoulda stayed on disney +. This movie tries to do too many things at once. It's trying to be an origin story, fit in multiple seperate villains all with separate motivations, the individual stories of EIGHT eternals and tries to make it all a part of the mcu and a story about morality and an action movie. And it doesn't do ANY of those things well. This is an unfocused, badly written movie that doesn't know what it wants to be, let alone how to execute that. This movie is 2 and half hours long but it feels like 6."
1525,8,"Gorgeous film, with some flaws It is indeed visually pleasing, and it has concepts that would keep most invested till the end. Only for them to realize by that end that not all thet hoped for had been explored. Yet still, they enjoyed it."
1526,6,"Sad and Dissapointing Chloe Zhao promised the grandest MCU film to date, and what was delivered was exposition that never delivered on its visuals or its story. The film tried its best to ask questions about morality and human nature without enough time to explore them deeply enough."
1527,7,"Confusing but aesthetic movie. It's certainly ridiculous to expect Chloé Zhao to radically reimagine the superhero film with Eternals. However, the depth of emotion helps to balance out the jagged storytelling in this new tangent in the MCU narrative. The focus on character, group relationships, and emotional complexity brings the film to life.They are Earth's protectors from a distant planet who have lived among humanity for millennia. They do, however, make repeated references to Thanos's destruction of half of all life in the universe.The Eternals are everlasting beings from Olympia. The Celestials sent them to Earth to protect humanity against marauding alien predators. The opening crawl of the film traces them all the way back to the beginning of time. There are hints as to how existing plotlines may progress.Sersi, an ancient antiquities specialist at London's Natural History Museum, is played by Gemma Chan. Richard Madden plays Ikaris, a fighter with the ability to fly and eyes that fire destroyer beams. Salma Hayek plays Ajak, a spiritual guide who can create a golden sphere through which she can interact directly with their Celestial creator, Arishem (voiced by David Kaye). The script, written by Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo, merely uses the comic as a starting point.Kumail Nanjiani plays Kingo, a man who can shape firebombs with his own hands and throw them in battle. There's much to keep you interested in the Eternals' blend of companionship, conflict, and rivalry. The straightforward depiction of a loving LGBT family marks a watershed moment for Marvel. Jolie plays Thena, a warrior with the ability to create and transform filigreed golden swords and spears at will. Ikaris, Sersi, and Sprite, who stand in for Peter, Wendy, and Tinkerbell, have an important relationship. The film benefits greatly in terms of texture from the diverse location work.The images have an enormous sweep and depict the Eternals as inhabitants of a familiar world. The action is often performed against physically imposing backdrops, with little reliance on greenscreen trickery. There's no getting around the traditional flaws of a long run length or a dense oversupply of plot. At the very least, the film ranks among the most interesting and creative chapters in the MCU canon."
1528,4,Meh This movie was a really good idea but i think it is probable the worst marvel movie. I don't necessarily think it was horrible but it lacked in the comedic scenes that make marvel movies enjoyable. I recommend that you do watch it but if you don't you won't be missing much.
1529,4,"What a long runtime mess of a movie! There are movies where you wish it were longer like Avengers or TLOR. Eternals was no doubt an ambitious project with top tier talent but it felt like none of them really wanted to be there.The movie is boring, doesn't get you hooked, and the action is average at best.If the movie was around 1H30M or 1H45M maybe it would be tolerable but with its current length and a lifeless performance, it falls short to other Marvel projects badly."
1530,7,Okay This was the first movie I've seen in theaters in months and I had a pretty good time with it. I think the idea was fine but the way Chloe Zhao develop the story wasn't good. And i also think that she should learn more about visual storytelling because this movie has so many lengthy dialogues.
1531,1,"Godawful Generic. Awful. Pointless. Boring. A waste of film. If you can make it past the utterly pointless, self gratifying opening, then *you* have superpowers. Thank God I streamed this because I would have walked out of the theater in the first 10 minutes. I'm happy I could just close the window and watch something else. It is *that* bad."
1532,7,"Underrated. I enjoyed very much . Its one of the movies that ,although the plot is nothing phenomenal ,the development of the idea was great. There was character building and the action was great. It was a classic Marvel movie. Its not a basic movie. I hope People will change their minds."
1533,6,Good but didn't seem like Marvel I enjoyed it in its own right but lacked some Marvel trademarks. The humor was lacking and I didn't feel any emotional attachment to the characters. Tried to introduce too much too soon.
1534,1,"omg never a marvel movie, is this for children? Is this movie for children? What's with just taking famous actors and packing them into one movie? And what's with cartoonized charachters? Definetly not a movie for adults and not going to watch marvel again. I can understand that the characters have super powers, but why bring already non-action actors for the majority. Also what's with the children movies looking charachters. Also no story, no goal, no logic in anything, just scenes put together to make a movie."
1535,10,"Fun movie, good origin story It took me a while to get to a cinema, but I enjoyed this movie just fine. There are several features that I enjoyed:* that blindly following a selfish 'God' is the wrong thing to do;* that the American military is notably absent;* that the best fighter is a beautiful woman;* that the strongman dies;* that love wins.How many superhero films have a plot resolution where love is the key factor? Not since Winter Soldier, eh...Yes, I enjoyed this film. Two fingers up to all the Reddit boyz who can't abide strong women in their films!"
1536,3,"Fell asleep Twice in the Theater This movie sucks on another dimension type level. Clearly the critics have gotten some type of Marvel check to big up the film. I'm not sure if the monotone acting is on purpose or nobody in this film has ANY energy besides Kingo. This is by far the worst Marvel movie. The CGi is HORRIFIC, the creatures look like they came from a B movie that went straight to DVD. It's a slow pace that builds up to NOTHING. They never really show any emotion for humanity as they go through conquering, death, and famine. Clearly this was a diversity/lgbtq cash grab...and it failed horribly. No pun intended I'm black but when you force things it just doesn't end up good. The fight scenes were sooooo bad. The director tried to turn a super hero movie into a weird Oscar film and she failed miserably. They should never let her direct another Marvel movie again. How the one hero AJAK died on the ice was horrible and not explained how she died so easily. Salmas acting was horrible also. Bad casting. Nobody seemed liked they wanted to act besides Kingos character, the guy who could mind control, and the black gay superhero. Everybody else just power walked through the film."
1537,1,OMG what a baaad movie ! Don't waste your time watching it. It is bad and boring and stupid. Marvel gave us enough good movies but this one is ewwwwww. And Salma Hayek is playing with her typical accent even as an alien leader ?! Pleaseeee....
1538,9,"Bad approach, but decent outcome First things first - it should have been a disney+ show, not a theatrical release.Introducing so many new characters in one movie was going to be hard to appeal to fans from the start. For some reason we don't get to see any characters from the MCU that we've seen before, just seems weird. But given how many characters are already in the movie - it's understandable.We do get a lot of action at some point, which is amazing. Thena, Druig and Makkari were absolutely amazing, enjoyed watching then fight so much.Celestials should have made a bigger impression. But seeing a half of an unborn Celestial getting out of Earth was amazing.Worst thing about this movie? Madden as Ikaris. Didn't work for me at all."
1539,7,"A different feel in a good way Eternals forges a new path different from previous superhero movies. Eternals is not perfect, but presents something fresh and different. It is an emotional sci-fi drama with superhero elements. If you expect the usual Marvel fireworks, you may be disappointed. This film is dense, heartfelt, and spontaneous in ways not seen in the MCU before, which is a good thing."
1540,6,"Would have been better as a standalone film. I have some pretty mixed feelings when it comes to Eternals.Pros:CGI: The CGI was spectacular, I enjoyed watching all of the fights.Acting: Acting was also very good imo.Vision: This movie took risks, which I applaud Marvel for doing.Cons:Pacing: Where to begin, this movie was all over the place. I think they tried fitting in way too many subplots into way too little screen time.Characters: Too many characters with too little screen time to develop, see my previous comment on pacing.Story: There is no good reason this movie should have been in the MCU, they spent way too long talking about why the characters were not involved in the events of the MCU.Overall I felt disappointed because I think this movie could have been so much more. I think it would have been better suited as a T. V. series or a three part saga."
1541,2,"Useless, poor Chloe Zhao... Empty movie, no story, ugly photo, stupid scenario: 7000 years of ignorance cannot remain believable, don't waste your time and money. Chloe has so much talent, this peace shall be forgotten from her work."
1542,1,"Marvel worst movie . The events were not connected and the story was lame and silly .So many charecters that everyone of them must have a movie because it is so big like the avengers, they have a big world and a lot to tell anout them .Despite all of this, truth must be told .This movie it didn't care about the story .it's just about races and agendas . I mean we don't have to like it forcibly, some people gonna like it, some not .Stop making agenda movies .Make a great movie .With great story comes great movie."
1543,6,"Had a lot of wasted potential I am an avid Marvel fan and I genuinely think this movie was good... in theory. The story and worldbuilding of how it relates to the wider MCU was decent but sometimes unclear and often scenes felt rushed. While I like a lot of actors that were in it I was underwhelmed by the characters.Overall, worth watching if only for Icarus to fly into the sun."
1544,3,It's just not it Worst and most boring movie ever. Sorry marvel but this time it didn't work for you! Spider Man No Way Home and Shang chi are just amazing ! Spiderman No Way Home Is now for me the best Marvel and best Movie ever!
1545,4,"Not enough Expected a lot, received a handful. Didn't like the casting of many roles and 2,5 hours were too long for this movie. Maybe it is because of choosing the wrong director gor this kind of movie."
1546,7,"A Good Fun Film After what feels like forever, Marvel Studios newest characters The Eternals have come to the big screen and I have watched the film today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film documents the story of thousand year old powered individuals and their fight against their sworn enemies The Deviants.Main Character Gemma Chan plays Sersi and she is the main character here and she is fine. Chan does an effective job in the role and she is just a decent character. She is by no means the best Marvel lead protagonist but considering this is a real ensemble cast she fits in very effectively. Richard Madden plays Ikaris and I thought he was great, it took me time to get on board with his character but he really starts to thrive as the film progresses and you learn more about him and his motivations makes him stand out from the rest of The Eternals.Supporting Characters Angelina Jolie plays Thena and I thought she was effective here. She is basically the films Wonder Woman and thus has some good action scenes but she has an interesting character that is somewhat developed and obviously Jolie can pull this off well. Kumail Nanjiani and Brian Tyree Henry are more of the comic relief and they are really good at it and they are just fun additions to the cast. Lauren Ridloff is really good too and she is really important as the first deaf actress to play a superhero and it feels like an important moment here. Barry Keoghan as Druig is a really effective character, he plays it really well and I really liked the twists and turns that were given to his character. Salma Hayek & Kit Harrington are also good in their smaller roles here and I kind of wish we could have spent more time with Harrington in particular.Story The individual stories for each member of The Eternals are well done, Ikaris, Thena and Druig in particular have really good arcs and make them interesting characters. The whole romance dynamic between Ikaris and Sersi is also really well done too and made it a romance that I actually cared about in The MCU. It has nuance in its storytelling and the motivations of different groups and people is well handled and made me care. But this film has a few too many characters in it and it does slow down the story telling, I also thought the whole ending sequence was a bit lacklustre and fails to deliver completely on the epic levels it should have.Script The script has some chuckle worthy moments and some complexity too it when it comes to a few of its characters. But it falls short of doing enough to really make you care about the overall situation, it seems so large scale but at times the dialogue is rigid and it digs its heels in, especially in the past scenes.Style The film looks brilliant. The CGI is breathtaking and the action scenes are fantastically made and flow incredibly well. The film is 2 and a half hours and it didn't feel too long for me and it felt like an appropriate length. But the pacing of the film gets let down due to its editing of the plot, it jumps all over time periods and it feels very choppy which did make the film feel disjointed with its feeling.Overall Overall, Eternals is a good film. It has a hard job of introducing so many new characters and story elements to an established universe, it has issues but overall I saw this as a pretty positive experience.Overall - 7/10."
1547,4,"Not for everyone If it's not broke... Like others have mentioned, the MCU has a formula and it works. But the director wanted to break the mold. Why? A sex scene, why? What did that add to the story? What's next? There's a reason why the MCU is so successful. Unfortunately this movie tried to push the boundaries and it's lack of success shows that not everyone is on board. The few stars in the cast didn't help much either. I've enjoyed almost all the MCU films so far, but this one isn't for me. Disappointing."
1548,1,Marvel studios officially dead! As a huge fan of Sci fi and past Marvel movies and series I can say with a sad heart that since the takeover by Disney and the sad passing of the late legend Stan Lee every production under the Marvel name has been Dreadful and this latest offering is no exception!When looking at the cast it is very obvious where they stuck all their money as I am sure the bill for the cast was humongous and maybe they had little left to pay for a good writer hence why the story and script is painful to watch!If Disney continue to not seek out a good/ great even writer and keep throwing money at hiring big names in the hope it will work they will annihilate the once great name of Marvel into nothing!I will have to be content with watching all the old Marvel shows when they produced great Sci fi not the trash on offer now.
1549,4,"Humanity has its flaws but... ...they care for each other and they love so they are worth saving.... I mean how many times is that storyline going to be regurgitated? And as an eternal it took you 7000 years to figure that one out?It's a typical MCU movie but this is one of the worse. The story doesn't make any sense. You create deviants. The experiment goes wrong so you create human robots with some random powers to exterminate them? You're a thousands of miles tall being, you could wipe them of the face of the earth in a blink of an eye but you create these insecure and weak robots to combat them. Makes sense. Why not make one giant robot with all those powers combined? They are called eternals but actually they are not because they can get killed and be hurt with a simple knife. And then at the end of the movie there's a robot more powerful than the others. So what's the point of having the others around? And of course the most insecure of the bunch becomes the leader. You have had thousands of years to get to know yourself and just before the celestial rises you figure things out.There is so much wrong with the story and whole plot that this just isn't it."
1550,4,"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! REALLY?! Again I am a REAL reviewer. If you look at my reviews, I pull not punches.I am a HUGE comic guy, 10,000 plus comics in my collections. I know storylines. I read A LOT.THE GOOD: ICARIS AND THENA WERE AMAZING. The BEST two things about a completely disastrous movie overall. They NEED to be brought back to be part of Guardians or Avengers or whatever.That being said:This movie was trash trying to be a steak dinner. At best.I LOVED the casting when I first saw it. I loved the inclusivity and I thought this was a great way to do it.Then I watched the movie and saw the issue wasn't the cast for me - IT WAS THE STORYLINE. WHAT?!Let's get something straight. It took Marvel 10 years of build up to get from THE KING - TONY STARK AKA RDJ - allllll they way to THANOS - but here you have a 120 lbs (beautiful) eternal KILL A COSMIC BEING. AHAHAHHAHHAHHAHHAHAH - Click never put this on again.I am scratching it from Marvels timeline. Completely. Garbage.You took a good idea and somehow managed to destroy it. Good job!"
1551,7,"Good Movie, Bottom Tier MCU Eternals may be the worst rated MCU film to date, but it is far from terrible. It's a modest attempt at shaking up the old MCU formula that admittedly has gotten stale as of late. It tries to be different, and it succeeds in that respect. Up until the very last minutes of the film, it didn't feel like an MCU movie at all. Which was refreshing, but it felt disconnected with the other MCU films. It tries to do too much. Essentially it's a poor mans Avengers. The story is rushed and since the characters are all new to us, it's hard to connect with them. The film does have good moments. There are fragments of a great movie in Eternals. Ultimately it just didn't quite fit together well enough. That being said it was entertaining enough to warrant a watch in the theater, and it does have large MCU implications. It's final post credit scene was the first one in a long time that got me excited. Overall it's a bottom tier MCU film, which makes it a pretty good superhero movie all things considered."
1552,6,"The most boring mcu movie Great visuals, great acting, bad story. A movie that has 10 main characters, all being introduced at once, needs to focus a lot of time of its runtime in character development, and with that much character development, it becomes boring."
1553,5,"Not much more than visual effects Several big names (actors) contracted for this movie ... not sure did worth it. The Celestials look like the Titan Kronos, from the movie of ""Wrath of the Titans"". The ""Emergence"", i.e. The process of growing up the human population to a proper size, which allows a new Celestial to be born (and that ""consumes"" the whole population, and even the planet itself) sounds very similar to the ""harvesting"" idea, from the movie of ""Jupiter Ascending"". The two ""Stark"" boys loving the same (Lannister Cersei) Sersi is a bad joke for those who loved the ""Game of Thrones"". The ""deviants"" look very similar to the blue Mimic from the movie of ""Edge of Tomorrow"". The way how Kingo shoots cosmic energy ""bullets"" with his hand, like a late John Wayne, is ridiculously embarrassing. The visual effects are OK; in fact this is the best part of the movie."
1554,5,"A perfect average film. I don't think I've seen a film this meh in a very long time. Like it is impressive how much a 5/10 this is. Story is boring and doesn't make sense if you think about it, the acting is serviceable I guess, visuals and sound are marvel level so decent. I just don't remember anything meaningful about this film. Has to be the most boring movie experience I have had in a long while. Congrats Marvel."
1555,5,"Not what I expected,SPOILER ALERT Maybe I expected too much from Marvel but this movie wasn't as good as Endgame. They killed off to many heros and it dragged on. If they make another movie I hope it's better than this one."
1556,5,"Not quite the film I was expecting... I went in with an open mind regarding the new direction the MCU is finally taking with its movies.I am all for the tonal shift from the campy, safe, formulaic, popcorn superhero movies to MCU movies that are more original in thought and execution. But this movie had trouble finding exactly what type of movie it wanted to be from the beginning. And unless you're a MCU super fan some of the story beats are just too convoluted to wrap your head around. Outside of some cool action sequences there's not really much here for your average movie goer."
1557,1,"No escapism. I watch fiction, SyFi or otherwise, for the escapism it gives me for an hour or so. I do not want reminding of all the misery of today's life but want to be taken away on an adventure, entertained and leave the theatre feeling warm and fussy inside and thinking - wow that was a great movie.Not this movie, don't waste your time."
1558,9,"EPIC !!!!! I dont get why this movie had a bad review , everything about this movie was just epic!! But one thing i noticed Angelina jolie role as Thena & Don lee as galgamesh were my favourite: their characters were just epicable & sory gemma chan but your character as Sersi was overpowerd by Thena:"
1559,3,"MARVELS ETERNALS: AMBITIOUS, UNIQUE & BORING The Eternals, a race of immortal beings with superhuman powers who have secretly lived on Earth for thousands of years, reunite to battle the evil Deviants.The Chloe Zhao directed MCU flick is a lengthy epic that is all about the creation of life , humanity, the progress and conflicts and the eventual destruction of it all for the inevitable creation of something new and thus the cycle shall repeats. The Eternals has a lot of ambition and unique stories to tell, which leads to Zhao using exposition whenever possible including an opening crawl that gives you further insight into the world.We follow the Eternals from Mesopotamia and before to modern day as we see their impacts throughout history and how they shaped human existence and advancement throughout. The first half of the film is spent hopping from one timeline to another, with jarring stops in the present day where a neccessary armageddon is steadily approaching.In the flashbacks, Zhao hurriedly takes us through the Eternals' arrival on Earth, how a few instantly fell in love with humans while others were frustrated by their greed and violence.The characters are mostly half-written, inspiring barely any affection and emotion from our side. But at least it looks beautiful as the vast story unfolds in front of your eyes. For Eternals, Zhao brought on board cinematographer Ben Davis, who has previously worked in five other MCU films. She also brings in her own love for the golden hour, dusk and landscape shots, wedging in the setting sun wherever she can.The film looks gorgeous, packs in a ton of interesting ideas, character introspections and the general superhero gist. But despite all of its flamboyance and grandeuer, its weak character development, stoic performances from most of the cast,unfunny humour, and the obvious pandering to DIVERSE audiences lets the Eternals completely down especially by the end.Zhao seems uninterested in action and thus the sequences come across flat as well, Angelina Jolie is easily the best actress but has little to do and Salma Hayek as Ajak is wasted. The most screen time goes to Gemma Chan who plays Sersi. She is perhaps the most one note actress I have seen which is really detrimental as the film relies on her and Ikaris's(another Eternal) romance, her eventual hero's journey as in the end she is the one who carries out justice.Their romance which even includes a sex scene(first in the MCU) but their general lack of chemistry renders it all emotionally hollow, devoid of uniqueness and personality.There are a few other Eternals(Phastos,Druig,Sprite and Kingo) and all of them have great ideas for their characters which are just cruised past without exploring their depths and meaning.Thus we are left with a film which has too much to offer for its own good. For it sacrifices its characters and glosses past them by the end of the film to hurriedly remind you with its credits sequences that the next one will be great.This is perhaps a notch above or two above the last MCU release, Black Widow. Unlike that lazy, uninspired snoozefest, Eternals did aim for a lot, however was very unsuccessful in delivering on most of the fronts. A lot could have been better but I guess it isn't the worst.At the end Eternals is watchable and yet perhaps skippable, for its lenghty runtime and uninspiring characters don't warrant anything precious from our side."
1560,1,The worst movie of mu Not as expected rubbish story eternals movie is not at the standard of marvel studio movie i think hero aloms movie is better than it all old actresses whom are expired.
1561,1,"Worst movie of the decade!!!! I don't know what movie these other people watched, but it must have been a different one then I. This movie was sooooo bad. It was boring, and most of the characters just wined all the time about oh poor me, blah blah blah. The pacing in this movie was horrible and routinely went on long tangents that frankly I didn't care about. Theres like two or three old GOT cast members and to make things worse one of the main protagonists is called Sirci so it made it even more muddled. I kept muttering, ""You know nothing Jon Snow"". For the longest time I thought Gilgamesh was the guy from Dr. Strange.Please for the love of god don't believe these 6 or high ratings, there lies...."
1562,6,Not what we waited an eternity for Another Phase 4 release that fails to hit the high water mark of previous phases. Average at best but likely worse for many.The Good+ Some good ideas that were either let down by plot holes or by not being fully explored+ Apart from the typical Marvel superhero story beats it didn't look and feel like a typical Marvel film+ Some of the comedy worked well+ The movie was representative from a D&I perspective which was nice to see :) though it felt as if it was the last film on the calendar before the annual D&I review so they packed in as many D&I characters and moments as possible.The Bad
1563,3,"Disappointing The comic version of the eternals were vastly more powerful than the down played film version, also what was up with Angelina...her portrayal of her character was that she was weak and frail. The producers departure from the comic was very FOX fix like."
1564,2,"Yikes I tried to go into this film with an open mind, but wow is it bad. The appealing visuals and need for MCU set up will give this movie 2 stars instead of 1.As many will say, this movie brings in way too many characters and tries to get the viewer to invest in each of them. There is a clear protagonist, but she is not given enough of a spotlight to stand out. The main antagonist is lame as well with a motivation that is explained but the viewer will probably not resonate with. The movie is also way too long and trying to tackle way too many conflicts. This feels like a knock off, less funny Guardians of the Galaxy and I did not like it at all. The plot was both predictable and unexciting. This felt like one of those obligatory set up films rather than an impactful story/experienceAll in all, this film is an absolute bust and its a shame to see such an interesting concept get thrown away. I really didn't think it could get worse than Thor the Dark World or Captain Marvel, but they found a way."
1565,1,"Waste of time Where do I begin to explain just how terrible this movie was? Zero chemistry with the characters, terrible story line and underwhelming action scenes pretty much sum it up. It's unfortunate that a movie that had such diversity and representation had to be such a stinker. Comic readers like myself will be annoyed at the resiculous origin reveal. The only saving grace was some funny parts with the Bollywood actor and his assistant. This movie was atotal waste of time and didn't further the Marvel plotline in any positive way."
1566,2,"Sleepy I was never truly engaged in the movie, there was nearly never a part where I was excited or could keep my eyes on the screen for more than 2 mins, truly a disappointing marvel film, I hope they learn from this and improve from this disaster of a movie."
1567,8,More serious tone is not for everyone Just got out the theater and don't understand the hate for this film. This movie doesn't feel like an MCU movie and to me that is very refreshing. Takes on more of a serious tone without a cheesy joke to remind you it's an MCU film. The action sequences I thought were well done with the type of enemies they were fighting. Good cast and even scenes with good acting that felt like realistic raw emotion. I think this film gets dislikes because certain things are shown and some people probably aren't that open minded or prepared for it. It's 2021 grow up. For the length of the film I think they crammed in as much as they could but I wouldn't have minded maybe another half hour since we were just introduced to these characters. That might be the biggest gripe on the film but then again once you watch it you'll realize it's not really necessary either. Go watch it and gather your own opinion. Not all people enjoy the same things.
1568,9,"Not a typical Marvel movie Don't go into this expecting a movie like The Avengers. Go into it with an open mind, and you'll be pleasantly surprised! Its gorgeous to look at, the characters feel real, and you truly feel what's going on on screen."
1569,1,"Great CGI, not so great plot Recent Marvel movies make you understand why comic books were for kids.The plot is garbage, full of stupid ideas ... the CGI is good, but for today's standards, not enough to justify a movie."
1570,9,"Marvel fanboys need to get a life. I'm not normally the biggest fan of Marvel films but this was so refreshing""""It's not the biggest and best film ever but it certainly trumps Avengers. I'm upset that people are ranking this poorly, but I'm pretty sure anyone could guess why. Especially considering how poor the first two avengers films are and people defend them.This film is nice, it shows lots of new and interesting characters, you really get a feel for the world and it's pretty funny. Zhao is an amazing director and the visuals are spectacular. Even if you don't like superhero films, I still highly recommend.Probably my favourite film of the year so far!"
1571,4,"Interesting Concept, Terrible Execution This series has many interesting concepts, which, unfortunately, Marvel could not properly give time to grow due to it being a movie. Honestly, if made as a series, this could have had the potential to grow to something truly great. I still don't understand why they are so afraid of that. Though another alternative, this could have done well if only Marvel lessened the characters, as some of them could be removed and have no drastic effect on the plot whatsoever, such as Kingo, Sprite, and Druig.Anyway, now the special effects and CGI. Most of them look downright clean and perfect, but some, for some strange reason, look like they came out of a low-budget sci-fi movie. I, nor anyone else I know, understand how this is possible considering the massive budget this movie has; 200 million USD.Not to mention how boring this is. Sure, the fights kept me engaged, the scenes with the Celestials kept me engaged, but other than that, the movie is drowned by talking and talking and talking, most of which have mediocre dialogue."
1572,7,"Alright, could be better Eternals is a film about a group of heroes that attempt to save the world from monsters; known as deviants. The movie twists are well done and pretty hard to predict (Icarus' betrayal and the Celestial's true plan). It is well acted and has a very diverse cast, The post credits scenes are very exciting and are good for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.In Conclusion Eternals could be better however some of the major plot points are skipped over and seem like empty plot holes. The special effects/CGI are well done, there is little humour which can make the film (occasionally) a bit of a drag."
1573,7,"Marvel's most perplexing film Eternals wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be a cool indie film while also maintaining its MCU comedy-blockbuster sensibilities. I will say that this works in many spots throughout the film, but there are also plenty where big philosophical debates detour into typical CGI action with jarring effect.The cast is massive and feels somewhat underutilized. Salma Hayek is very miscast and Angelina Jolie's casting feels wasted as she isn't given much to do. Gemma Chan is fine, but I'm not sure she's blockbuster-leading material. Part of it is her character, which is not super interesting and has things just happen around her. There are simply too many characters and actors for everyone to get their shine. This probably would've worked better as a Disney+ show given the overwhelming amount of new world-building.Another issue is most of the movie is them just getting the band back together. With an already long film, devoting a large chunk of it to reintroducing characters is confounding. The story does have some real intrigue and thoughtful moments though. I found myself fairly engaged throughout, only occasionally looking at the time.Eternals is a big swing from Marvel and while this doesn't have homerun power, they make some decent contact."
1574,10,"Eternals This movie was amazing and I really enjoyed everything. This wasn't your typical ""Hulk smash"". It was a masterpiece of a movie that I think deserves more credit. People probably did not like it because there wasn't much action, but that was the whole point. The eternals had to live normal lives and had to fit in. The people that did not like the movie probably did not understand the plot."
1575,8,"Eternals is a good movie Chloé Zao, with increasing importance in this industry, has brought us great projects such as Nomadland, awarded at the Oscars and, in 2021, Eternals, for many one of the best films of the UCM.Without knowing anything about the history (and going on the list of films by Avengers) I have to say that I am surprised, nothing to do with what Marvel does, of that I am sure.I like the cast, there are great emotional moments and good humor.I fell in love with the colors, choreography and of course the locations. A good movie, grateful to have seen it in the cinema."
1576,5,"Too much threat ! There are too many villains in the story-line. I believe that the writers should have focused on one particular menace, because it felt like watching two movies in a row. As a result, none of the characters got a fair chance to be fully developed neither the eternals nor the deviants or the celestials. The deviant Kro is basically another instance of Ultron mixed with DBZ's Cell which absorbs other cyborgs to evolve but never gets to implement his revenge satisfactorily. Ikaris's treason and love affair with the heroin is totally cliché. And the celestials back story poses more issues, more questions and no answers. Though perfect in her role, Angelina Jolie (as Thena) can't redeem this parody of a movie which resembles Ms Marvel's first installment."
1577,1,"Disgusting It had a few fun scenes, but this movie is so bad and disgusting, I was about to throw up a few times . I would've left the theater if I wasn't there with my friends."
1578,5,It's a wonderful movie This is a good movie action fight scenes is very good and this is not good movie more than avengers and game and other movies of Marvel Studios it but I think this movie is very amazing in blockbuster movie and when I watched this movie and I enjoy.
1579,3,"A visually spectacular film with no plot. Many people enjoy turning their brain off for some good special effects. This film may work well for those individuals. The effects are spectacular. The plot is stretched so thin that I believe even the special effects crowd will get bored.On the positive side, the film includes someone from every possible ethnicity from any geographical point in the universe. So much diversity is included in the film it is distracting from the absent plot. (Wait why are these people together?) On a final note, MCU throws in a dance scene in order to cater to the billion individuals in India. It has some cool dancing, but again has nothing to do with the absent plot."
1580,10,A MUST WATCH! The cast was amazing! Everyone did a spectacular job. And I really appreciated the diversity of the cast. The movie was very action-packed from start to finish. Also if you are a lover of history or mythology then this is a movie for you.
1581,8,"Epic and excellently staged superhero film, but using the usual MCU scheme does more harm than good Positive:gripping action scenesimpressive backdrops and breathtaking imagesimmediately emotional despite numerous new heroesrefreshing dramaturgy with clever twists and no typical CGI orgy as a finaleNegative:the integration of MCU-typical humour and all sorts of allusions feels forced and wrong in addition to the epic narrative and spherical style. As a standalone film ""Eternals"" would have been more rounded."
1582,6,"I agree it's the worst This is ranked as the least critically acclaimed MCU movie ever made and boy, can I see why. Having not liked ""Black Widow"" as much as I thought I would, I can easily say it's still better than this. This movie features the Eternals who were created thousands of years ago to protect the Earth from monsters called the Deviants. Halfway through, it's revealed their creators, the Celestials were planting seeds in the Earth as they must destroy planets to create a new Celestial. A planet must have a certain population before the Celestial seed can grow. Why didn't they intervene when Thanos destroyed half the Universe, seeing as how a reduced population would greatly hinder their plans?Much of this movie consists of them meeting each other with no action. I can now say that Scarlett Johansson is hotter than Angelina Jolie. While the special effects are breathtaking and the premise is interesting, it just doesn't amount to much. It could have easily been trimmed by a half hour and nobody would ever know. It's just okay as it does have a nice diverse cast and even the first gay couple in an MCU film! I'm sorry to say we've got the first of these films I didn't like, but it's still at least watchable. **1/2."
1583,3,"Too Long and Too Much Awkward Dialogue Trying to be fair here, but I have to point out a few things that irked me.I. Too many side-stories happening.Side characters initiating dialogues with each other about ""you left me alone 1,000 years ago blah blah blah.."" very generic with little depth of character. The side romance stories and the side atory with the sword-lady's mental health deteriorating could all have just been left out. To fix this the movie could have focused more on developing a single character, it would have made it less awkward because no one really cares about some unspoken rift between characters that supposedly happened and now there's a grudge.II. Rehashed powers.Seeing the same generic magic powers again and again. Yes I know it's a Marvel movie, but adding gold streams doesn't make super speed or super fist or eye-lasers cool again. It's all been done.III. Too much gloss.Fancy fighting moves and powerups and dance-fighting is just played out.In the end, the move could have been better if more main characters were killed, to give it a darker feeling."
1584,5,"Not so Marvelous Eternals takes place in present day in the MCU. It is about an immortal alien race that has been living among humans for centuries without interfering in their conflict. Their main enemy as they know are Deviants which can exterminate humanity and even kill the seemingly immortal Eternals. One Eternal, Sersi lives in London with another fellow Eternal Sprite as they try to enjoy what human life has to offer. Once the Deviants return however, they along with Ikaris stop it from destroying London. They decide to search for the other Eternals around the globe to stop the Deviants' return and await Arishem's return.Eternals was a movie I was excited for the moment I heard about it. The more I learned about it, the more I was looking forward to it. It just seemed so different from all of the other Marvel films that I wanted to see how the story would unfold. Also, I loved Chloe Zhao' as last film, Nomadland. There was a lot for this movie to deliver on. Does it deliver on the story and material?I don't know how Eternals fares as an adaptation to the comics so my review is solely based on how this movie operates as a movie. As a movie, it is a huge mixed bag. Let's talk about the good stuff. First of all, the cast is terrific. This is one of the most diverse casts I have ever seen in a blockbuster and I appreciate how Chloe Zhao makes sure every single character gets some limelight throughout the film. Some characters are more developed than others, but they all feel like they have at least some hidden depths and chemistry. Some particular standouts are Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo who is as charismatic as he is funny, Angelina Jolie as Thena, Salma Hayek as Ajak, Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Don Lee as Gilgamesh and Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos. They brought their characters to life and made them feel like people with conflicting emotions rather than just soulless robots of an alien race. Another standout for me is Harish Patel as Karun. He made for an amusing comic relief, but when he had serious scenes, he executed them perfectly. He knew when the tone got more serious and he has some great emotional moments in the film. Finally, I liked Richard Madden's performance as Ikaris. He plays the stoic character with some insecurities very well. This is a great ensemble cast and they deliver some great performances.I also thought the movie was great on a technical level. The cinematography is solid, the visuals are stunning and the action scenes are outstanding. They flow so well and the camerawork is some of the best in the MCU. The final battle features this camera work in action. It uses the powers of all of the Eternals at the scene. I thought the costumes were pretty good as well. However, this is where things start to go south for this movie...My biggest problem with Eternals is the script. It's a hot mess. This is easily one of Marvel's most ambitious films because of the huge cast and the themes of humanity, pleasures and compassion, but the movie has a lot more exposition than it should have. It also has some jarring tonal inconsistencies. This film has many out-of-place comedic moments that kind of fall flat for the most part. I did get a chuckle here and there, but I think this had the worst humor in an MCU film. A lot of it has to do with the timing. There were so many times I feel like the movie was starting to take a serious direction and then a gag randomly pops up and spoils the mood. When the film tries to be dramatic and intense with the Eternals reflecting on how they can influence and impact humanity, it comes off as melodramatic. The scene in Hiroshima particularly standouts as does the scene right before they split up.The pacing is what really frustrates me. The movie is two and half hours long. While that is a long runtime, it makes sense for a movie like this that has a lot of material to cover. The problem is that it feels like the story progresses so slowly. It takes forever to move from one country to another and some of the flashbacks can be pretty confusing. I feel like there were a lot of scenes that could have been sped up such as Arishem's conversation with Sersi or one of the dinner scenes with Gilgamesh.While I liked most of the characters in the film, I do think they could have been better developed in some areas. Particularly, Sersi ends up being the most vanilla character in the movie despite being the focus. She has very little personality traits or depth aside from being an all-loving and altruistic hero and being fascinated with iPhones. Every other character in the film has more interesting traits than her. Ikaris could have also been more interesting as well, but there is a twist that helps him. Sersi on the other hand? No offense to Gemma Chan who does her best with what she is given, but Sersi is probably one of my least favorite protagonists in a comic book movie. I just never got attached to her at any point.Eternals has its ups and downs, but ultimately, it is a letdown. I think it could have been overhyped after Chloe Zhao won Best Director at the Academy Awards but even then, there are too many problems with this film. There is a lot of good in here and I was always curious to see what would happen in each scene, but it is not enough to save the movie entirely. I hate to say it because it is clear Chloe Zhao and everyone else who worked on this film were trying to create something truly special and unique from Marvel and in some ways they did. However, this movie shows why ambition alone does not make an amazing film.Despite all my problems with this film, I am happy that I saw it. It helped me clear my mind of stress and rebuild my excitement for films.Just like any Marvel film, stay through the credits."
1585,2,So boring. A 2-hour constipation ad. Effects are fantastic. Too bad the story and the script are mediocre. The narrative doesn't connect. It's just a random slide show.
1586,3,"One of the worse Film ratings are very strange I find. Take this as an example. It got a really high rating yet for me I almost walked out if the cinema I was so bored. This is the same with Black Widow. I'm not sure what made this film popular. The story weak. The special effects mediocre and actually lacking. Even the supposed funny bits, not funny. Generally speaking Marvel films are getting worse and not better in my opinion. It could be they're spending less because the films still attracts an audience bu5 I can see there's less money being spent, special effects lacking and poor."
1587,1,"So bad that it failed to fail I really don't know what happened with this movie. I've seen better CGI in movies made before 2010. Dialogues, character building and story structure is better in any Michael Bay movie but he at least compensates for it in action, suspense and epic scenes and shots.I have no idea about what message or ideology this movie was suppose to the audience consider. I've seen deeper social criticism in Michael and Webb ""are we the baddies"" comedy scene. Was this movie a comedy, adventure or sci fi? I don't know and frankly I don't care.Who were the characters? What was their purpose and drive? I don't know. I never connected to any character or got any interest in the story. This movie just moved from one McGuffin quest to another. I've seen better story structure in 80's video games.What bothered me the most was how much of a nothing this movie was. It was bad indeed but it wasn't bad enough for me to enjoy how bad it was. Everything was bad, don't get me wrong, but not epic bad so it's good like Cats or The Room. The movie failed to fail.Please Marvel, you have many good movies, please don't repeat anything like this ever again. Black Panther and Captain Marvel weren't perfect but compared to The Eternals they were like Shawshank Redemption and Godfather."
1588,10,"Great Movie! I am a big fan of Marvel Universe, and I must say that it really impresses me!Amazing performance, interesting story, and characters, beautiful fight scenes.This movie is deeper and more profound than other Marvel movies.And I think it brings fresh air to the universe Definitely recommend watching."
1589,10,"Love it or hate it Bringing the celestial side of Marvel's comics, Eternals is different from everything we've seen in MCU. Every character of the group is well developed and explored, we can connect with which one. Visually, this is one of the most beautiful movie I've ever seem. There's a feeling of magnitude, caused by the scales used.Although, even if it's different, they felt like they need to use some of the ""classic way"" and some jokes were totally out of place. This was kind of a mood breaking."

1592,3,"Dire. I've read several critical reviews applauding this film, however having sat through it twice I have to point out that this is a very poor film.Almost two and a half hours long, and every single minute of this film was an effort. How on Earth did they think this would appeal?It's a lifeless watch, it rambles along at a torturous pace, and sadly half the cast seem totally disinterested, giving very wooden performances.Special effects vary, some look good, some look very poor, when you look at the budget this film had, it should have looked flawless, it doesn't.I love Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but neither of them look totally at home here, I only hope this turkey of a movie doesn't halt either career.I don't think a second will follow somehow.Awful sadly, I did give it a second watch to be sure, but there you are, it's a shocker, 3/10."
1593,9,"I was expecting worse I really enjoyed this film, I was expecting worse, but it was really good, sod the fools that give bad reviews, bring on a second Eternals, I will pay to see it."
1594,4,"That was... At first, it was confusing with all these time jumps. In the end, it was the standard Marvel formula with a lot of CGI effects and non-explainable character developments. In addition, the film is 30 Minutes too long, at least."
1595,9,"Not sure what movie everyone else saw I am a little late to the party. I would directly compare this film to Man of Steel. The action, direction and tone were similar. Much like Man of Steel audiences have been divided and I fall into the category that loved both films. Dont listen to reviews and see this for yourself, on the big screen if possible."
1596,10,"Great movie! Fantastic characters, all well done and introduced for such a large cast. Interesting story. Great effects and visuals. Definitely different and awesome addition to the MCU."
1597,1,Flat like milk carton I can't believe it was so boring that I was too bored to even fall asleep and eventually we walked out half way through. What was I watching? Why did Angie agree to this?Cons: carton board characters. Too many characters and each of them is flat like recycled milk carton.Monsters - unoriginal Effects- nothing new.Story - it was so confusing and the dialogue was so childish and cliché that I had lost interest in the actual story. At some point it was like half Matrix illustration discovery that made no sense.Pros: don't know what to say. My sit was comfortable.
1598,4,"A Miss for the MCU I love the MCU, but for me, this one fell flat. Origin stories tend to be the weaker movies, but even in that context its near, if not at, the bottom of the list.The story is rather weak and predictable and the action sequences give us nothing new or interesting that we haven't seen numerous times before. There are several characters (Dane & Kro for example) that truly served no purpose whatsoever as far as furthering the story and all these flaws are magnified by the run time that should have been cut by 45 minutes."
1599,10,"A Step Up, A New Level A superhero movie with an original concept and plot...where writers and actors get to explore characters in scenes that last more than 30 seconds and every line isn't delivered in a staccato burst between cgi trapeze acts. Rather than people being overwhelmed by their own powers we see gods brought to the level of humans in someplace that isn't New York and a story that revolves around something other than megalomaniac madmen. Marvel perfected the genre and now takes it to another level, one with more depth and a lot less of the expected. Even superheroes (not to mention writers who want to write and actors that want to act) get tired of the same old formulas."
1600,6,"weird movie to say the least I love this movie the first time I watched it but the more I think about it the more I realized how stupid it is. First of all the first hour is hard to sit through with clumsy editing and terrible pacing but then it picks up surprisingly well after Druig forest fight.Exposition is definitely the worse part of this movie and adding new villain just 40 mins before the movie ends didn't help the pacing either. One of the villain was sidelined (and I'm pretty sure the writers don't even bother giving him a name) for the sake of having another villain makes you wonder why they even bother with having multiple villains in the first place. And that's just the villains problem. There's still 10 new main characters that makes everything much worse.But still I think it have a great ending and against all odds, makes me excited to see what they have in store for a sequel. It's a weird movie but I'm glad marvel actually tried something different this time despite the results."
1601,9,"Great movie If you just know how deep is the MCU or rather the comics, you might like the movie as it shows supremeness of some characters and the roles they play in the universe."
1602,8,"A great film with some missteps along the way! I went into Eternals with an open mind after seeing & hearing the diverse response to this film & I did like the film.Unfortunately, there were a few problems with the film. The biggest problem for me was the utilization of Richard Madden & Kit Harrington in this film & it especially annoys me as a big fan of Game of Thrones.Overall, I would recommend that you go into the film with an open mind & you can decide what your opinion will be with this film."
1603,10,"Can't understand the bad reviews In short it is a very beautiful film; visually, audibly, incredible acting and a unique approach for marvel to approach story telling.If you're familiar Chloé Zhao's work it's a great experience- the ideal of exploring the person in the picture rather than typical marvel jigsaw board. My only feedback is that I wanted more and the development was too quick at times as there felt to be so much more to know in around half of the cast.I think if this film didn't have the typical expectations from marvel abs the trailers showed that this was more abstract (think like the joker movie and how he fits into DC) it would've been better understood.All round totally worth the cinema experience, great cast and a tase of the world Zhao envisioned."
1604,1,"Worst Comic book movie ever made Very Boring.Firstly the characters are so week, in addition to that there are no chemistry between the team.Movie was too long and too many characters were introduced and you don't love these characters much.The movie was very slow paced and felt that it doesn't fit within the Marvel Universe, Shang-Chi was a really great movie starting the Phase 4 of Marvel. But Eternals fails to deliver on all aspects.."
1605,6,"Too much but too little at the same time I was really looking forward to this movie. I really like the direction Marvel is going with the MCU end I really like the Eternals in the comics. And in this particular case I really like the movie to0. It opens the ""bigger"" world behind the earth and the avengers, really introducing the celestials and a whole new universe (or multiverse).But I really didn't like the execution of ""Eternals"". Too many characters introduced in too little time with too much conversation between two characters. Therefore the characters are so superficial with no depth.The dialogues are nonsense and are only there to explain something to the audience. I know it is a commen tool to explain difficult things within dialogues in movies, but NOT when the characters know each other for hundrets and thousands of years. They don't need to explain each other something. And 2/3 of the movie is only this.The Deviants are superficial ""monsters"", not interesting and just there so the Eternals have something to do until they can fight the ""endboss"" and to have action between the nonsense dialogues.And the big fight in the end is so unspectecular that I was really disappointed. That was it? This was the fight againt a damn celestial?I liked that they used the Uni-mind and of cause it is difficult to introduce so many characters in only one movie. And the costumes, the set and the music were preety nice too.So in the end my review sounds pretty hard because I was a disappointed about the poor execution. Nevertheless I was really happy to see this movie and glad that Marvel made this movie. I'm excited about the direction all of this is going and ""Eternals"" was only the beginning."
1606,1,"Nope... Nope...Nope...Nope...Nope...Nope... Nope!!! The most eternally boring MCU movie to date! Please disney and marvel, just stop. You have already bled this thing dry, It has nothing left to give. This movie added nothing to further the MCU, and was completely unnecessary and pointless, making absolutely zero sense. Acting was sorry, writing was sloppy and directing was amateur at best! You're not winning anyone over, so please stop trying!P. S. The good reviews have to be FAKE!"
1607,2,"No no no, this movie should never have happened Weak story, bad writing, cringy jokes, shallow conversation with no chemistry among the crew, and superman!!! Not to mention the accents. Did accents come before languages, or did languages come before accents? This riddle makes me vomit!"
1608,10,"A Controversially Unique Masterpiece This is one of the best movies I have seen in the last decade. It features so many things done amazingly from technical wizardry such as astonishing cinematography and mind blowing visual effects to the core elements such as triumphant acting, a (mostly) clever script, an intriguing story and subtle direction. I you want a movie that features the wildness and unpredictability of Quentin Tarintino mixed with Scorsese's exploration of life and humanity, you get Chloe Zhao's controversial masterpiece. Particularly Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Richard Madden and Barry Keoghan stood out as actors who thus portrayed interesting, complex and fragile characters. Chloe Zhao gives her best work (after Nomadland) yet and the script-writing duo made quite a good story, albeit the story could have been more... perfect. Ben Davis' Cinematography is naturalistic and looks real, the score is fitting and the soundtrack just right. I am not too much of a fan regarding superhero movies but this doesn't feel like one. It does not feel like part of the MCU. Why the nativity then?Well, it is quite risky and you can expect some shocking conclusions to certain characters which was completely shocking to me. Some say the story is weak and yeah... that's all the criticism I could really define... Also, this might seem like a coincidence but the fact that a woman directed it and critics calling it a ""messy production"" (that's as vague as it goes:/). So go see it for yourself, it might just be on the best movies you'll see... or not great at all... Either way, in my opinion this is a true cinematic triumph that encompasses all parts of the medium to bring out the best in this genre."
1609,7,"Eternals (2021, Chloe Zhao) While there are story and thematic issues this is a bold, new chapter in the MCU 'Eternals' is a superhero film from the Marvel/Disney juggernaut that is the MCU. This is the 26th film in the interconnected universe, but really only the second film in phase 4 which is attempting to push the MCU in a new direction following the end of the Infinity Saga. It began with the introduction of Shang-Chi and now we get a bunch of new, relatively unknown heroes in 'Eternals'. In a very interesting selection they procured Academy award winning director Chloe Zhao to direct and co-write the film. Zhao does not immediately leap off the page as an MCU style director with her recent success coming from the critically acclaimed drama 'Nomadland'. 'Eternals' is an ensemble piece and introduces a full cast of characters never before seen in the MCU and stars Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Brian Tyree Henry and Angelina Jolie among others. It has quite a beefy run time clocking in at over two and half hours.The film starts with some pretty hefty exposition and explaining which typically is never a good start to a film. It gives a crash course on who the Eternals are and their purpose. They are nigh immortal beings created by a Celestial which is akin to a god for the express purpose of killing monsters known as deviants. They are sent to Earth around 5,000 B. C. and live immortal lives among the humans hunting and killing deviants throughout the ages. In 1521 the last of the deviants on Earth are killed and the group drifts apart awaiting direction until in present day it appears that the deviants have returned and thus the Eternals must come together once again to fight them. There are 10 Eternals and Ajak, played by Salma Hayek, leads as the Prime Eternal and is the only one who can directly communicate with the Celestial Arishem who created them. While she is the leader Gemma Chan, who plays Sersi, is ostensibly the main character. As they attempt to reconvene the group Ajak is found dead and she chose Sersi as her successor for reasons unknown as she did not exactly seem like the obvious choice. Sersi subsequently communicates with Arishem and discovers a ground shattering truth, literally and figuratively that will split the team and put them at odds with one another as they pick sides. When it boils down the decision is between their mission or protecting the Earth once they learn their true mission does not really concern itself with the protection of the people or the planet. Of course the film wraps up on a cliffhanger of sorts leaving itself practically demanding a sequel, and introduces even more new characters in multiple end credit scenes.This film is a lot to take in. The premise is a bit wonky and the twist, while interesting, almost raises more questions than it answers. There is a lot in the way of new characters and material to absorb here. First and foremost this doesn't really feel like other MCU films. It just seems to be lacking that spark that even the average MCU films all possessed. One of the best MCU traits was that balance of humor, action and drama in a pretty super hero package and this film isn't very action heavy and humor is not as on point as it usually is. I am not sure if that is just the nature of the story or is due to Zhao as writer/director, and I am not saying they should just keep making the same thing, but they have done a great job of creating new content while hewing close to an always winning formula and this film certainly is attempting something different. This film is certainly the most diverse we have seen in the MCU to date which is a good thing. I just wish the diversity felt more organic and not like someone was going down a checklist to include everyone under the sun. One of the big hurdles I keep coming back to in this film is how these beings fall in love with Earth and its inhabitants to point they want to save us all. I am not sure I ever buy that. It is easy to believe if you look at these beings as human, and as portrayed most of these characters seem to want to be human, but they are not. They are immortal beings from space that have been built and programmed and we are just supposed to believe out of all the planets they have been to we are so special and privileged as to merit intervention and deviance from their assigned purpose? I understand how we have to be that special in order for the story to work I just don't think it would ever actually work that way and thus the story never really worked for me as constructed. For the most part though I found the acting throughout quite good as well as the direction overall. I very much wish this would have had more action in it. There also is a prime deviant character who evolves throughout, but a big showdown with that bad guy is cut rather short quite literally. I will admit though that by the end, when the credits rolled, I did want to see the continuation of these characters and what happens next. It is very much a slow burn and while I am critical of a lot overall I did think this is a decent film and worth exploring. It is just not in that upper echelon of what the MCU has accomplished to date. The MCU still struggles to find footing with post Avengers heroes, but as always I am along for the ride, and Marvel's ride is still better than the vast majority of films out there these days.Eric's Grade: B-"
1610,1,"Worst Marvel movie all times Worst Marvel movie all times.This movie is one of the worst marvel movies I've ever seen. The movie had a complicated plot that was all over the place. There were flashbacks in weird moments that contradict ideas that have already been introduced. Save your time and don't see this movie. Trust me, I'm a huge huge marvel fan but this movie is not worth it."
1611,7,"I appreciate the commitment to backstory To balance 7000 years of existence and ten team members, Chloe Zhao does the job well. I've seen comments and reviews saying it's messy and a PowerPoint presentation but rarely felt like that was the case. It didn't treat the audience as idiots which can be the case with how exposition is handled in many other films. It's unfortunate that many ideas that make a lot of sense here have already been overused in many films before such as intricate holograms and sky battles.The acting is great. The natural source of the jokes means they land more effectively than the usual MCU 'quips' and a good part of this is down to Kingo and Karun. Set, costume and special effects are gorgeous. Wish we had a little more time with Evolved Kro."
1612,7,"Decent entertainment, a little loose storyline I don't think it was a bad movie, I just think expectations were a little high. Good director, good actors, and a lot of advertising as the shiny new addition to the MCU got everyone hyped up about it. I enjoyed parts of the movie, hence my rating of 7. The execution, however, didn't end up loving up to its full potential. I think they tried to tell too many stories and ended up not focusing well on the main plot. I do hope that they utilize the actors such as Angelina Jolie in future in a better way. Having these characters in MCU gives me hope. Maybe that hope is misplaced, only time will tell."
1613,1,Wast of time and money This movie is the worst marvel movie ever made even worse than the bad marvel series It was a total waste of money and time Don't watch it.Nothing else to say.

1616,3,"Boring awful garbage Everything wrong with movies today; poorly told second rate storytelling farted out by a committee. Gaiman source material has rarely been adapted well and this no outlier sadly. At least I know why it's called the Eternals, cos I thought it would never end."

1618,8,Pretty inspiring Amazing cast. From human emotion to conflicts between hero's there is no shortage of heartfelt ideas including the ability to be a hero with disability.
1619,8,"Finally, a superhero movie with decent drama Great scenery, huge amount of HEAVY & DEEP emotions, the first one in MCU after Iron Man's death. Not even Black Widow's death was processed this long.But it was a nice change of pace. I'd want to see a sequel."
1620,7,"Interesting Premise; A Bit Too Much One of the more interesting movies in the MCU, conceptually, ""Eternals"" struggles a bit with the large cast of characters presented, the large time-span of the story, and a lackluster final act. All said, while it is perhaps one of the most interesting movies in the franchise, it falls flat in presenting its story as fully fledged as it could have. There are concepts here that are very refreshing for a superhero movie to cover: the price of having god-like powers, the toll of destiny, and self-sacrifice and rebellion against a cause that is unjust.I really love the concept of the story. The Eternals are a group of beings that were created and sent to Earth with the task of protecting humans from another race known as the Deviants. We are given more exposition and backstory as the film goes on. There's some great mythological and cosmological story-telling that is unusual to see in the Marvel universe, and it's honestly refreshing to see the franchise go in this bold new philosophical direction. It leans a lot more heavily on science-fiction than the typical superhero genre. Which might be an explanation for the mixed fan reaction. This isn't your typical Marvel movie.The issue that I have with ""Eternals"" is that it seems to barely scrape the surface on any of these topics. It's mostly given to us through expository dialogue. They aren't running themes throughout the movie. The cast also seems too large at times. A two and a half hour run time isn't enough to give all ten Eternals enough time to shine. What's worse is that the main character of the movie, Sersi (Gemma Chan), is cardboard as well. She has nothing of a character, other than her relationship with Ikaris (Richard Madden). My favorite character is probably Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani). He's got some pretty funny jokes with his sidekick Karun (Harish Patel). It's a shame because he just dips out of the movie at some point.This whole movie is both very interesting and very disappointing at the same time. It had a lot of potential but it just doesn't deliver on some of the cool ideas that it floats around. The special effects and the cinematography are both excellent. It's got a high level of polish that you'd expect from a Marvel movie. I'd recommend this one more to science-fiction fans than fans of the traditional crime-fighting superhero."
1621,8,"Eternals 2021 12A Director: Chloe Zhao starring: Gemma Chan, Lauren Ridloff, Angeline Jolie, Barry Keoghan, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Ma Dong Seok, Bryan Tyree Henry, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Kit Harrington, Bill Skarsgard, Harish Patel etcFollowing the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants. This film proves that rotten tomatoes isn't always right, and people should make their own opinion. As I really loved this.My first few positives would be the fantastic cinematography and action. As well as fantastic powers and representation. And finally, the fantastic performances and chemistry between the cast. Eternals for me is one of the most visually stunning movies I have seen. And especially from the MCU. The cinematography was unique and large in scope. But also having that rich grounded appeal of an arthouse film, with Chloe Zhao finding the perfect balance between them both. I also thought the action in this film was excellent. It wasn't overused and balanced well with the rich and detailed plot. But it was always entertaining and felt different and unique to other MCU movies. This is mostly because of the variety of amazing powers by the characters. All the characters had their own distinct set of powers, that were both visually stunning and interesting as a concept to use. I also thought the representation in the film was fantastic. The MCU is finally starting to bring some more diversity into its movies which is amazing. The LGBTQ+ representation was great and the deaf representation with Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) was particularly excellent with the use of sign language. Finally, I thought the performances and the chemistry between the cast was fantastic. The performances from the whole cast were excellent and some of the strongest I have seen in a superhero movie. Particularly from Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden who all did particularly fantastic especially with their more emotional scenes. The whole cast also worked well together and had fantastic chemistry, there relationships with each other just felt very natural and believable. Whether it was comedic or emotional they all worked brilliantly together. Kumail Nanjiani had great comedic chemistry with everyone.My next few positives would be the great character designs. The amazing set up and explanation to the plot. As well as the amazing humour, and excellent worldbuilding and themes. I thought the general design of the eternals with their different coloured suits was really interesting and distinguished the different characters well, also making them more God like which fitted with the aesthetic of the film. And the design of the deviants was also particularly strong as they resembled different creatures. I also thought the set up was strong. Establishing the characters normal lives as humans was an interesting way to start. It made me connect with the characters on a more human and personal level which is rare with superhero movies. And introducing the deviants was an effective way to break the norm and set up the rest of the film. I also thought the explanation to the plot and the worldbuilding was fantastic. There wasn't one detail that was left out of the movie as it was written excellently. With some of the most outstanding and fascinating lore and worldbuilding I have seen in the MCU. Introducing us to a whole new part of the superhero genre. I also thought the humour in the film was particularly strong. It wasn't overused like some MCU projects. It had just the right amount and the humour worked. With some great gags between Kingo (Kumail Nunjiani) and Karun (Harish Patel). Finally, the film tackled a lot of deep themes. Chloe Zhao really added her artistic touch to the superhero genre, and I loved it. The film was moving and thought provoking and tackled issues that haven't really been used in superhero movies before. Highlighting the greed and cruelness of humanity as it has grown and how horrible the violence and hatred has become. Which tied in with a lot of the characters morals and powers excellently.This film was not perfect though, and I did have some issues. There was lack of character background to certain relationships. As well as a lack of emotional connection in parts. Also, some of the film was very exposition heavy therefore impacting the pacing. And some characters were underused. I would have liked some more background into certain characters relationships before the set up. Particularly between Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Dan (Kit Harrington) as their relationship felt a bit rushed to me. I also found myself emotionally disconnected in parts. Particularly with the death of Ajak (Salma Hayek) it was very oddly places right near the beginning, and considering she was such an important eternal, and her role was big I found it hard to be emotionally connected to the death. It was oddly placed within the structure of the film and felt out of place. Some of the film was very exposition heavy, explaining every detail is great. But it also impacted the films pacing in parts when there wasn't a lot going on with the characters. I also thought the deviants were underused and needed to play more of a role within the film. The villain was strong, but I felt like it needed to be in the film more to add more impact.My final few positives would be the interesting elements. As well as the fantastic plot twists and development to the plot. As well as the great character conflict and structure. Finally, the fantastic script and final act. I thought there was a lot of interesting and unique elements added to the film. Particularly with the powers of the deviants taking eternals different abilities and the mythology surrounding them as a race was really fascinating to me and it was well explored. I also thought the plot twists were excellent and developed the plot excellently. They weren't just used for shock factor, it had relevance to the plot and motivated the characters to change the way they were living. I also thought the character conflict was excellent, not only did it help split the group up more easily. It raised a lot of interesting questions with the films themes and the morals of the characters. I also thought the structure of the film was fantastic. I liked the switches in time and how they were structured within the film. They held a lot of importance to the film and its characters and filled in any plot holes that were created in the present. The script for this film was fantastic. Chloe Zhao did such a good job at adding her intelligence and depth to a superhero movie and a lot of the issues tackled really made me think and it was a great reflection of society. The final act was also excellent, the stakes and the action were incredibly strong, and it ended in a satisfying and conclusive way, whilst also setting up a lot of great new things with the excellent end credit scenes.Overall, despite all the pieces not fulling meshing together. Eternals is a visually captivating and ambitious movie. That takes the MCU in an amazing new direction. Further solidifying Chloe Zhao as a fantastic director. I applaud Marvel for creating something so different and going against the formula.Overall score 86/100."
1622,1,"Probably the worst MCU offering so far... The Eternals are represented by a 2.5 hour runtime, which feels even longer while watching. This was probably my companion's favourite part as she had a nice nap.They are fighting the Deviants which are the brilliant hodgepodge of accents from the UK, US and Korea, which blend together like haggis and kimchi.It does end with a Celestial though - that heavenly feeling when the credits roll and you head for the exit!"
1623,6,"It wants to show so much emotion, but it feels the contrary The visuals are so beautiful, we can't deny that. I absolutely loved the cast variety and the chemistry some of the characters have.Sad to say that the relationship between Sersi and Ikaris felt son plain, the main protagonist felt plain and boring. It was difficult to empathize with them. Like i didn't care about their storylines and wanted to know more about the other characters.There were really off place and weird scenes happening, like i do not know if they were for the laughs but it felt very anticlimatic.I think that eternals could have been better as a series."
1624,4,"Subpar - shouldn't be a part 2 Somewhat hard to follow; although, could be because the film was so long. The main reason the film was so long is because they had the burden of introducing an entirely new concept and it took time.Somewhat disappointed with the addition of a sexual act, not sure it was necessary. They also found it necessary to introduce other lifestyle choices... that was disappointing for a super hero movie; won't be taking my young children to see this movie - sad.Overall, I do not see this particular concept having sustainability. Definitely not Spiderman, Ironman, or even Captain America worthy.Let's go Marvel."
1625,2,"Definitely different but maybe just too different This movie just tried too hard. Where Shang-Chi rose with introducing a cast of new characters with relatable qualities and motives with endearing goals, this movie should take back it's invitation to being a Marvel movie.Unrelatable plot of finding out the Celestials are the pawns living in an android or synthetic what have you body yet lived comfortably for thousands of years some more quietly than the others. What compels them to truly fight and risk all for humanity (minus Kingo)? While Kingo brought small moments of laughter, it's not enough to be a saving grace."
1626,4,"Really? If this was made with the same seriousness as i.e. Dune or even Superman it would have been a Great film - but instead, it's all over the place. It's as if the writers and director were just making their first film with the biggest budget ever and decided to have 'fun' with it and messed it up, big time. I honestly had cringe moments. Angelina Jolie - the biggest star in this film has the least lines, less than 1 page of script!If a second Eternals film gets the go ahead - I hope they pin it down give it the professionalism it badly needs."
1627,6,"Good but not impressive Eternals was a decent movie. I really liked the storyline and most of the action scenes were very nice. Although i think Angelina Jolie's role was a little bit useless without purpose. I think her role was more for promotion of the movie rather than for the actual plot. Also i don't understand all these DC ""jokes"" and references. For me some spots were obvious DC copies."
1628,1,"Worste Marvel movie, hands down Despite the many well known actors in this movie, the characters, plot, and heart of this movie fell completely flat. It was the opposite of inspiring, and had no true heart or hope in it. It was boring, difficult to relate to, and was the first movie I've ever asked for my money back. I'm pretty sure the only reason its gotten any good reviews is because of the popular actors and fact that it is supposed to be a marvel movie in the marvel universe. Gross error in a line of fantastic and inspiring movies and stories. It will soon be forgotten about because there was nothing significant in it, just fancy attempts to put seemingly strange agendas in a highly expensive production."
1629,8,"Cosmic Powers And Weapons Eternals: Ever wonder about different groups of Meta-Humans, Demi-Gods etc who inhabit the MCU yet don't seem to impact on each other until it's time for a new film complicating the timeline and Canon? Never mind, just sit back, relax and enjoy the fun. The Eternals are sent to Earth to protect humans against the Deviants, predatory monsters. Arriving in Mesopotamia in 5000 BC they battle the Deviants using killer eye-beams, super strength etc. The locals are a plucky bunch though and menace the Eternals with spears so Druig (Barry Keoghan) has to control their minds, those minds and hearts are soon won with gifts. Throughout history the Eternals battle the monsters, we them in Babylon (complete with hanging gardens) in 575 BC, in Gupta, 400AD. They have a sort of Prime Directive not to interfere in human conflicts and this especially causes problems for Druig when he sees the Conquistadors slaughtering Aztecs in 1521. But they do nudge technological development along with inventions by Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), I'm not saying it's Aliens but... Anyway after a 500 hiatus the Deviants return so the Eternals must assemble once more. I'm always expecting Ikaris (Richard Madden) to say See You Jimmy in his Scottish accent as he headbutts a monster. Thena (Angelina Jolie) forms weapons from cosmic energy but (like a Limerickian) is likely to stab anyone due to her demented state (Mahd Wy'ry). There are ten Eternals in total with numerous other characters. A coupe of interesting plot twists add to the intrigue. An action drama with a fine vein of humour. Directed and Co-written by Chloé Zhao. 8/10."
1630,8,"Very entertaining I watched this movie without any former knowledge of the film and was pleasantly suprised!The film has its faults, the casting feels a bit forced, but overall the story, script and acting were on point. Great editing and directing resulted in a very entertaining movie."
1631,7,"Better than the typical Marvel stuff I was surprised to see the low rating and critic this movie had received. I watch all Marvel movies mostly they are decent, funny, enjoyable but very predictable. I would say this was better than the typical Shang-Chi hero stuff. A sollid 7/10 like most Marvel movies."
1632,2,Movie was trash!!!!! I was generous and gave it 2 stars. Very long and boring. I found the eternals a huge waste of my time. A lot of talk. Bad jokes maybe 1 or 2 decent characters but in the bulk of it. Don't waste you're money or time unless you have absolutely nothing to do for 3 hours and see a big marvel fan.
1633,1,"Literally the worst movie ever The plot, writing, characters, and acting were terrible. I considered leaving the theatre twice during the movie.I was excited to see another MCU movie and was disappointed."
1634,6,No clue- it was ok Ok the good bits were the costumes and the monsters. Richard Madden voice was monotone throughout.and he wasn't acting at all. Angelina Jolie played herself. I struggled to follow all the back and forward in time and changes of allegence.
1635,7,"Very ""high-concept"" for the MCU God i'm so conflicted with this movie ... definitely understood the pacing issues mentioned by many. But it gave me thena x gilgamesh and druig x makkari so 7 stars it is."
1636,10,"It's better than what you think. This is something new and different, with an excellent story. Most people have Avengers stuck in their head and you have to throw that memory aside. This film is so much better than what people give a credit for. Watch it a second time if you have to but give it the credit it deserves."
1637,3,"Disappointingly Boring What a load! Limited acting, spurious time line and scattered story. How this complements the rest of the Marvel universe is to be seen. Angelena Jolene must be hard up for a role these days and yet still phoned this one in and Selma Hyack could act her way out if a paper bag in the trope filled pile. In my view this a straight to DVD movie with no redeeming factors or anything new to add. Waste of my $15."
1638,7,"The Eternals Question I fail to understand the negativity around this movie. I read some of the critics' reviews and thought them to be too abstract - as if they entered ""Eternals"" not even with a notion of what they personally want it to be, but knowing full well what they'll think about the movie even before it started. In honor of the Eternals' 10, here are 8 big things I liked, 2 small I didn't:1. Apart from one solution I won't spoil for those that still have not seen the movie, I thought that the movie successfully resisted the temptation of being sucked into the PC vortex.2. Kit Harington aside - who, truth to be told, was just as annoying as expected, so no surprise there - the characters are well-developed, as are the relationships. Zhao introduced them who they are through what they do, not what they say they should be. When things start to unravel, there is a real sense of tragedy, loss and grief and it's all because Zhao precedes it by treating her subjects not like senseless, but sentient beings.3. Unlike ""Shang-Chi"", the comic relief here isn't forced and Nanjiani (Kingo) is an actual superhero that we don't have to ask ourselves how on Earth he keeps on staying in the story's mise-en-scene (unlike Awkwafina, who in my mind overshadows almost everything from ""Shang-Chi"" whenever I try to remember something, anything about that movie, and, needless to say, ruins it). Also, no one needs to remind me Nanjiani is funny, because he actually is.4. I don't remember the last time I caught myself thinking about Jolie's acting chops.5. The OST is great (the GoT composer Djawadi), but I can't say my broadest smile didn't happen when I heard Pink Floyd's ""Time"".6. The trailer certainly deceived me how well the movie's going to look, because the visuals did not seem particularly promising and the art direction felt lacking substance and depth.7.""Eternals"" can exist outside the MCU, which, in 2021, is no small feat (the info it shares about Thanos is practically all you need to know so it doesn't mess with your understanding the plot). Having said this, I don't see why there'd be difficulties to incorporate its heroes in the Disney's monstrosity of a money-making machine.8. I found the costumes grand, simultaneously Earth-bound and not of this world (the blue colour on Ajak and Ikaris makes them look particular).Here are a couple of nitpicks (someone might find them to be spoilers, so you can depart here):1. There's a fight between Ikaris and one of the Deviants that reminded both me and my friend of DiCaprio's ""The Revenant"" bear fight (the creature's moves, camera's angle, everything). Nothing special, just felt like a leftover of something that was reused. I am also not sure about the Deviants and their treatment here.2. The so much hyped sex scene is, of course, underwhelming. Yes, the moment is intimate and we don't need von Trier or Noe here, but it's nevertheless a reminder that this movie is American and you are still more likely to see a toddler's top being blown off by a shotgun than a couple of bare behinds enjoying themselves."
1639,8,"Quite a unique MCU movie...... The thing about the movie which was really unique and impressive was the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the attractive Gemma chan and Salma Haye as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Angelina Jolie,who has portrayed the character of Thena,was incredible ""at her age"". Another thing I liked about the movie was its shooting across a varieties of locations around the globe including Spain, England , the US,Fuertaventura and Lanzarote. Moreover the action and VFX scenes were thrilling and fascianting. Another thing I particularly liked about the movie being an Indian is its showcasing of the ancient Gupta aempire and tradition. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I recommend this movie if u r a MCU fan. The movie won't disappoint u."
1640,6,"Ehhh The visuals are really amazing, eye catching and the CGI for the powers is some of the best i've seen BUT the lines are really..how do you say..cringy. Some of the line delivery and acting as well was lacking and it threw me off at times. They also threw that random Ikaris(Richard Madden) and Sersi(Gemma Chan) sex scene in there which was as unnecessary as all the other sex scenes in films. I enjoyed it but it was a decent film. Oh yeah, Druig was sexy."
1641,4,"Possibly the ""worst"" MCU film. Okay, bear with me since this will be a difficult review. I don't particularly think this was ruined by too many characters as Endgame had 31+ characters, but suffered from poor pacing, runtime, and the lack of character development. I have to say that I did not enjoy this film as I am not into mythology stuff. The first and second acts were painfully boring with a bit decent third act. Ajak was given nothing to her character. Sersi. I almost have no idea what to say about her, but her personality should have been interesting. For Ikaris, I was not interested in the romance between him and Sersi. The sex scene wasn't needed at all, although I am surprised that have gotten away from that in a PG-13 movie. He does have a few fun scenes where he speculates a table to be made out of vibranium, slams it which turned out it isn't. ""I don't wear a cape."" Kingo was a decent and fun character that I mostly enjoyed throughout the movie. He had an interesting character setting where he has a fondness for movies and modern technology as he is a famous Bollywood movie star, dancer, and director who has fun with humans. Karun was also a fun presence with great chemistry with Kingo. The stuff about him and filming a documentary was hilarious. For Sprite. Oh my god. I think she has to be my least favorite character in this movie, there isn't anything interesting about her, and she always whines. Phastos was not bad, but a decent character. I have to say that the 1945 scene was mentally heartbreaking commenting on how advancing technology can have brutal consequences. Druig. I do have big mixed feelings about him. He does somewhat have a character arc where he doesn't want the humans to have a conflict so he uses his powers to stop them, but is stopped by the group. Eventually, in the third act, he learns to not interfere with conflicts, but still, I don't like him either way. Makkari wasn't annoying like the others as she has a likable personality, lack of ability to speak. She's fun and has a great dynamic with the team. Also, I liked how they treated her speed ability. Thena does actually have somewhat of an interesting character arc where she can have episodes that make her go rogue against the team which leads her to go with Gilgamesh in order to make anything to not go worse. The scenes of her fighting with her weapons are quite entertaining. Overall, this is just meh.4/10."
1642,7,"As I said to my girlfriend in the third act - ""This is very good, but still disappointing. I wouldn't go as far to say I'm bored but can they hurry up and do something?"" Pros- Spectacular visuals.Feels different to anything else we have seen in the MCU, and does it well.Well cast and acted, with an interesting group of characters.Great CGI.Solid and emotionally intense final battle.A few suprising turns in the story telling, more so early on.Cons- Padded run time which doesn't prioritise character building.Disappointing lack of Kit Harrington's Dane Whitman.Ineffective major character death in the final act.Overarching narrative predictable."
1643,2,"Eternal... The film is coherent with its name, it seems Eternal, i was wishing to end from half of the movie. And wishing to see the end credit scenes to go, because the movie was so slow and boring, compared with this one, Black widow is a masterpiece. For me this is the worst Marvel movie."
1644,8,Definitely a must watch movie!!! This is really a good movie. I don't see where the hatred is coming from. Of course it is not the typical MCU type movie. This movie started a new era and new dimension in MCU... I personally enjoyed the movie!! Some great drama is shown. The jokes were also okay ( I know that the jokes in Shang Chi was much better but that doesn't mean the jokes in eternals are dull) and there were some scenes in the middle and in the end part of the movie where I literally cried watching.If any of you reading this review and trying to decide whether to watch this or not then I will say if you just want to watch a action MCU type movie then don't watch it but if you really want to invest yourself in the MCU universe and want to show some new dimensions then it is a must watch movie.Bonus tip : Dont miss the mid credit and the end credit scene.
1645,9,"Everyone needs to chill, it's really not that bad I am so tired of people comparing this movie to a Zach Snyder film when it's a completely different format. I honestly really loved this movie, probably my favorite marvel movie yet. There was some stuff at the end that didn't quite make sense to me, but it didn't take away from a wonderful viewing experience!"
1646,10,"LOVE IT! I was so glad to see this opening night. I loved every character, and memorized all of the names after the movie. It brought great emotion and action. I saw this with my dad and I can tell he liked it, even though my family isn't really into marvel!! I would watch this over and over again!"
1647,7,"Still don't know if I like it or hated it?! I'm writing this review a week after I saw it. Sometimes you have these movies, and you go outside and it feels like you enjoyed something, but also not really. It was all clear that the whole cast was pulled together to tick all the boxes of different kind of humans and representations out there (+ Angelina Jolie, she is a representation on her own)... I did like the fact it was not a typical Marvel movie... it had character developments, and typical human stories with jealousy and stubbornness in it... but it took away as well from the whole superhero magic. I'm very curious who this is going to turn out further... and how they will get introduced within the Marvel Universe, as they are all stubborn characters with their own will. The end of the movie... the end credit... that cameo? I mean?? People started to laugh in the cinema even. Let's not do this please! Eternals is a well made movie, but... do I wanna see it again like all the Other Marvel movies? I don't know yet honestly. I think I'm good."
1648,1,Worst marvel movie Worst marvel movie. I can't think of a worse movie than this. Very disappointed. I wish they don't continue the series .Just don't watch it it had no humour very cold movie with too many Greek things and like boring effects and plot. Also it looks a bit copied (the film) like from dc.
1649,1,"Painful Watch After initial reading prior to launch i was sceptical in deciding to watch this, in the end i watched it with friends who had invited me. Probably one of the worse movies ive watched its been a huge flop and I am suprised its even manage to reach 6 starts here. Save your money and time. Massive flop."
1650,9,"Refreshing take on a Marvel superhero film Pleasantly surprised by this film! After watching Shang Chi which I thought was one of the worst Marvel movies ever, I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly impressed by Eternals. This movie reminded and showed me what an absolute treat the cinematic theatre experience is. This show should absolutely be watched on the big screen. I laughed, cried and was surprised at many points.Yes there were too many themes and the film would benefit from narrowing down what they wanted to focus on. But I think the commentary about humanity and relationships between the characters are what makes this a refreshing take and introduction to these characters. I can't wait to see more of them. Angelina Jolie was an absolute treat to have on this movie!"
1651,5,"Just like Icarus... Got too close to the sun & burnt up before it got to it's preferred destination I enjoyed the spectacular special effects but, unlike Shang Chi, the storyline played second fiddle to the aesthetics. It focuses too much on (Harry) style, but with little to inadequate substance. It had a star studded cast from whom I expected or at least hoped for better than what was delivered.It had 2 actors from Games of Thorn series Rob Stark (Richard Madden) & Jon Snow (Kit Harrington) & is similar to the last series of GoT in that they both left me disappointed. They had established actors such as Angelina Jolie & Salma Hayek to show off their acting chops as well as up & coming star Bill Skarsgard (penny-wise)... Plus Gemma Chan (Sersi) is a decent lead protagonist, who also starred in a minor role in Captain Marvel. It reminds me of 300 but the storyline was not compelling enough for me. The twist I saw a mile ahead. It does look really fantastic & marvel never seems to fail with the choreography fight scenes. DC films seem to be playing catch up on this department & storyline thus far...It had such a diverse cast but maybe they spread the material too thin & the film suffered as a consequence. I hope the sequel addresses the shortfalls & make a better storyline driven film with the improved special effects."
1652,6,"Boring It has the starcast, the visuals but also the same old boring superhero storyline that feels too long at 2.5 hrs.Marvel needs to relook at their strategy because it's getting tiring.Shang chi was such a breath of fresh air."
1653,5,"Pfffff Watching this film in the cinema is disappointed with such nuances as the disclosure of the characters, story, plot, impressions! The film was made for the sake of a tick. It seemed as though Chloé Zhao was sitting on the back desk. Apart from the history of Sersi, Thena, Phastos, nothing else is mentioned. By the way, the story of Phastos in general was very impressive, although it is clear about someone in this film. It seems to me that Director Chloé Zhao was not the right decision. I hope Marvel will draw the right conclusions."
1654,5,"Not Marvel's Best Eternals definitely did not feel like a Marvel movie. In short, there was a lack of action scenes, and the back-and-forth between the Eternals' past and the present day made it feel like I was watching a documentary about the history of the world. I enjoyed that, but I wanted a Marvel movie.As a whole, the film was entirely too slow and convoluted. Chloe Zhao seems to have a knack for dragging conversations out against stunning backdrops. That being said, the cinematography was gorgeous; Zhao's mark certainly did not go unnoticed. It was the script that was lacklustre, and it seemed that no one really knew what to do with it. There was too much going on-the Eternals having to find each other, the multiple romantic relationships, the Deviants, the Celestials, the different relationships between the characters, the backstabbing...there was a lot to keep up with.Kumail Nanjiani, Brain Tyree Henry, Don Lee, Barry Keoghan and Harish Patel had the best performances, and those are only four of the ten Eternals plus a side character who got brought along for the ride. Aside from Patel, who was mostly comedic relief, those characters brought the most depth to their performance and had the most interesting stories. It seems fitting that they had the least amount of screen time. Angelina Jolie seemed like wasted potential, and there were some scenes where it was very clear that she was acting; her performance didn't seem entirely natural. Salma Hayek also delivered an okay performance, and Lia McHugh wasn't too bad.Gemma Chan was the worst of the bunch. There was something off about her performance, like she wasn't all there or wasn't really paying attention to what was going on around her. She and Richard Madden are not a good pairing. I couldn't understand how they were supposed to have this epic love with such a huge backstory, because neither of them brought that intensity. Actually, to be fair, Madden brought intensity albeit in other aspects of the performance. The entire history of their relationship was told in a five minute montage that resounded in an extremely awkward sex on the beach scene, which was completely misplaced in a Marvel film. The failure of this relationship's portrayal says more about Marvel's inability to integrate good relationships into their films. Black Widow and Hulk was very out of left field, Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter never had enough screen time together to be entirely believable as ""soulmates"", and as much as I adore WandaVision, I'm still unclear on how those two ended up together aside from the fact that they were a couple in the comics and that carried over.If anything, Keoghan and Lauren Ridloff played Druig and Makkari's romance far better, because it wasn't explicit. The subtleties made it far more interesting because I wanted to know more about them and how they ended up together. The fact that there was no backstory provided to their relationship only added to the intrigue.As for the villains: lately, it appears that Marvel may be going down the multiple ambiguous villains route, but there were too many in Eternals. The Deviant that became an Ultron look-a-like felt like an afterthought. It delivered a monologue, ran off, and was quickly killed in the final battle. That character really wasn't necessary, because then there was the Celestial coming out of the Earth, which seemed like a much bigger issue. I don't think the remaining Deviants were even acknowledged in the end. Then, to top it off, there was Madden's Ikaris double crossing the team, which wasn't all that surprising considering the very obvious foreshadowing provided leading up to the reveal.As for the post credits, Kit Harrington as Dane Whitman seems to have an interesting future ahead of him, which I for one am looking forward to. Harry Styles as Eros, Thanos' brother...well, I'm not too sure about that. Knowing Eros' character, Styles' appearance makes sense. Only time will tell if his performance will match.Overall, this movie fell flat. When I watch a Marvel movie, it's because I want to watch a Marvel movie. Eternals was slow, convoluted, and there wasn't enough action. This film was a very mediocre introduction to who the Eternals are and I'm sure they will become more interesting and developed as time goes on, but this just doesn't compare to Marvel's phase one stand-alone films."
1655,8,"So Much to See, One Viewing Is Not Enough It took me a while to process the whole experience of Eternals--partially due to two lousy theater presentations that caused me to miss key moments. But everything came together brilliantly in the third viewing, and I have to say, Chloe Zhao achieved something special here.The film begins with an opening crawl that the audience will distrust as the plot is revealed. We meet the Eternals on their spaceship as they arrive on Earth in 5000 BC to combat the Deviants, a race of monstrous predators that have begun killing humans. The ten Eternals arrive and start their mission of protecting humanity over centuries from Deviant's, vowing never to interfere in humanity's conflicts under strict orders. It's a smartly addressed question posed to them early on by Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) when he learns his girlfriend Sersei is an Eternal, and he wonders why they never helped fight Thanos.Having gone their separate ways after their final mission during the Aztec War, they find themselves reuniting to combat the Deviants who have suddenly emerged once more. But this time, they're different, capable of absorbing the powers of the Eternals. It's a small detail that's glossed over, but it a savvy MCU viewer will know this is a setup for a bigger story later.The story progresses by showing you The Eternal's past failings over the years and how they ended up where they are now. They need each other to ward off an even more significant threat: an event known as The Immergence.There is so much to explore here as Zhao uses every scene to plant seeds about this new world while deconstructing these gods. In many ways, they are as weak as humans, flawed beings who have also been fed lies to further the agenda of the powerful. Zhao uses her settings and camera work to create the most epic-looking visuals ever seen in a Marvel film. And nothing plays out as you expect it to play out in this genre. The decisions each of these ten Eternals make are profoundly different than what we've come to expect from superheroes. Yet, there is still that element of heroism that makes Marvel characters feel as though they care about the worlds they inhabit.The performances are sedated to some degree, and at first, it felt a bit off for Marvel's usual cast of energetic, quippy heroes. But once I learned their true origins, it made more sense for them to behave as they did. Each Eternal is gifted with a unique ability such as super strength, healing abilities, illusions, mind control, and super speed. The later power is one of the best on-screen presentations of a speedster I've ever seen, and Lauren Ridloff's Makkari, a sticky-fingered speedster, is easily my new favorite Marvel character.The Eternals is a film that has already divided the Marvel community as it doesn't feel like any other film in the universe: it's more methodical and heavy on exposition. But that's what I love about this film. There is some intense world-building at play here, and while some of it may have been best served in a Disney+ series, the visuals demand a big-screen presentation. This is one of those Marvel films that viewers will go back to years later and realize how much it matters to the broader arc of Marvel films and make them wonder how they missed all that was seeded here."
1656,9,"New Beginnings A lot of the previous reviews are complaining about run time and the slowness of the film. I think fair enough, this is the second longest MCU film and it has some pretty slow scenes, but I like that about this film. This is the a new beginning for the MCU, they bet a lot of money on this film and they're going to win because they took their time on telling such a massive story. This was the most stylish and beautiful MCU movie I've seen, and I cannot wait to see more of that. The devastating twist of the film is something I enjoyed, and I didn't see it coming. These Eternals has been on earth long enough to see humanity at its best and worst and it was their job to save us from the Deviants. Throughout the movie, it felt so little like a MCU movie and more like I was there watching and waiting at their dinner table or I was in the fight with them. I felt their pain and their happiness and their chemistry because these actors and actresses did one very good job. If this is the direction the MCU will going in, in the future, then you can have my tickets pre-booked."
1657,5,"It was good but.. This really should have been a mini series on Disney +. There were just too many main characters and too much to learn throughout the story. Having said that, I enjoyed how Marvel approached this in their not so typical fashion. You could see the characters become more and more human along the way until the final conflict where they truly struggled between following their mission or protecting humanity which, to them, was an impossible task. The internal conflit even continued once they had achieved their goal."
1658,7,"It's not the best mcu film, but not the worst, either Honestly, this film has a few downsides. It is a pretty good film. I like it a lot. But I feel like they pushed a few characters to the side. I really liked the story, plot twist, and action. It was a really good movie, just I feel like they had too many characters."
1659,9,Yes! Very good movie about the Marvel universe in which the story is fascinating but also the action scenes or the special effects are excellent and the music grandiose.
1660,1,"Boring. This movie is long and boring. The characters are not developed well, and when they are put into bad situations we (the audience) have very little invested in them - that leads to our indifference when they start dying off.The film provides a backstory, that these characters are cranked out for several different worlds - so when they die, they can easily be replaced by a clone.Really - there is no character development. Maybe that's because there are so many new characters to develop, there just isn't time.The movie is just bad. No reason to watch it a second time. No reason to buy it on DVD.Disney - please do not make another Eternals movie."
1661,2,"The decline of the MCU continues... First, the visuals. This by far the most gorgeous MCU movie. However, there are a number of CGI effects that are rough for a Marvel movie, which shouldn't happen as often as it does considering the enormous budget Disney typically pours into its large action superhero movies. Second, the characters. It has 10 characters, which is an absurd number to care about, but is comic accurate. It is for this reason that Eternals should've been a TV show or two-part movie. However, considering that the movie is 2 hours and 37 minutes long, the characterization should be more developed than it is. Some of the characters do have interesting motivations, but not enough to save the movie. The writers' attempts to forge a bond between the characters become a copied and pasted version of the dynamic we've seen in other Marvel movies. They attempt to create this bond through jokes (which do land), banter, and tender moments (some of which land), but unfortunately these are not used effectively enough to guide the audience into feeling anything beyond basic surface emotions for the characters. Third, the MCU has its first sex scene. It is brief and not explicit, but completely unnecessary to the plot and characters and was avoidable. Fourth, the pace. This movie rushes forward, then slows down, then rushes forward, and so on. It typically goes between fight scenes with Deviants and philosophical discussions. This is very annoying because, while entertaining, the fights with the Deviants begin to feel repetitive and like they are there to fill the runtime. It is as if the movie cannot decide where it's trying to go, so it lurches back and forth. Fifth, the story. I loved the high concepts and backstory this movie introduced. Thev were certainly the strongest part of the movie. They made me excited for the future of the MCU. However, this movie feels more like a setup movie than an actual movie we are supposed to care about. It is forgettable, except for the things it sets up. As mentioned before, the Deviants seem to be there to entertain and fill the runtime, not to meaningfully contribute to the story. By the end of the film they almost feel like wasted villains. The story becomes interesting when the high-concept philosophical issues are being explored. Finally, the movie is mostly well-acted, as would be expected with a cast of this caliber. However, some of the actors seem to be bored with the material they've been given. I would be too. The two post-credits scenes are worth the wait.If you're looking for an entertaining Marvel(ish) movie, this is for you. If you're looking for unique concepts, complex characters, and outstanding execution, then very specific parts of this are for you. Sometimes Eternals doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, and that's a good thing because it indicates Marvel could break free of its standard formula. Unfortunately, the concepts are much better than the execution. Eternals had the tools it needed to be successful, and it isn't a bad movie, it just wasn't put together right. Even if it's not particularly rewatchable it is worth seeing for the sake of understanding the future of Phase Four."
1662,7,"Better Than I Thought It Would Be Eternals is a weaker film when it comes to the overall scheme of the MCU, clearly I've seen better, but for what I got as a stand-alone, it was better than I thought, still mediocre in many ways. I appreciate the attempt at being a slower, more melodramatic compared to the other MCU films. Lots of time characters are just sitting or standing around and talking and lots of it. The only thing that kept me from getting really bored was the occasional fight sequences they'd throw in. I'm not saying I need all action and no substance, but the dialog between the characters was uninteresting, and nothing was really grabbing me emotionally. That brings me to my next issue, I personally know nothing about the Eternals, I went into this film completely blind hoping that maybe the film can help introduce these new characters to me. Unfortunately, that also failed in my eyes. I left the movie knowing only what each character's abilities are, and a few of their names. I was driving home from the theater and I couldn't remember all of their names. That's how forgettable the characters and character development was for me. Also, there was no need for this film to be almost three hours long. Why does every Marvel film have to be near three hours long, some actually reach three hours, but that was the Avengers film which I can understand because they have to cram so much story, characters, and information in such a short period of time, however the Russo brothers did a much better job at delivering and executing those things. Chloe Zhao has shown she is a very gifted filmmaker with Nomadland, but apparently she had plenty of creative control, so I have to criticize Zhao for the overall execution of the character development, and too much exposition. However, I do really appreciate the execution of the action and fighting sequences especially having to do with the Deviants. There was one in particular towards the middle of the film that I was having a good time with. Some of the background shots are absolutely breathtaking, and the cinematography was beautiful as well. These things are so strongly executed that they almost outweigh the negatives I mentioned earlier. But as it stands, it is a mediocre film with bad character development, uninteresting interaction between characters, too much exposition, and too long of a running time; but also has exceptional fight sequences, breathtaking backgrounds, beautiful cinematography, and the score are all that make this film what it is. Therefore I reward it with a solid 7.2/10."
1663,7,Better than expected. I went to the movies with low expectations but thanks to critics I was surprised. The movie is by far much better than others MCU movies praised by critics. Go to watch the movie and enjoy!!!
1664,6,"Too ambitious to connect with the audience Marvel gives us two and a half hours to catch-up on thousands of years of history, introduce nine lead characters, understand the threat and feel afraid of the present danger. They have forgotten the success of introducing The Avengers a layer at a time so we could embrace them, understand them, and love their strengths and flaws. They have forgotten how the ensemble introduction of the Fantastic Four bombed - twice. We cannot decide who to trust, who we want to succeed and who we should mourn when we are faced with so many choices with so little screen-time.Such an incredible pool of acting talent that could produce nothing deep with the Eternals. The very nature of being alive for thousands of years means losing the element of urgency, and apparently chemistry. We weren't able to identify with being eternal and the couple of humans we meet were so accepting (probably to save time) that they were also void of emotion and intensity. It was visually stunning, so therefore deserving of six stars just for the VFX team, but sadly did not connect with me on any level."
1665,1,"Boring, boring and boring This was the worst movie I've seen in recent memory. There is no character development at all so there's no emotional connection to the story. The plotline is also confusing- talk of Deviants, Eternals, Celestials, etc. Combine that with the jumping back and forth in time, and you're left with nothing but special effects. I can appreciate that the movie focuses on inclusivity (at least I can to some degree) , but that doesn't make up for a boring, confusing movie. Even my 16 year old son was extremely disappointed in the movie."
1666,2,"Three boring hours What a terrible movie. Stan Lee would be turning in his grave over how Marvel movies have lost direction. This movie was disjointed, badly acted, poorly scripted, over long and overbearing in its attempts to include every conceivable minority. It was tedious & boring."
1667,4,"Slowwwww To state the good--- it could have been great, but they incorporated way to much wondering about for no good reasons.... This movie is way to long and boring .... Concierges walking out of the theatre but my partner was napping lol. Actors were really fantastic though, they all did a fantastic job it's just the story line and dull."
1668,8,I can see why people don't like it I get some of the arguments for why it isn't good but it didn't feel that long. All the people mad that gay people exist in the MCU should really evaluate their life if their mad at seeing gay people. I didn't think the movie was too dark it isn't as colorful as the Guardian movies but it has enough color. Kro should've been the big bad or shouldn't be in the movie. Most of the hate the movie is receiving is because of how hyped up it was.
1669,6,"It was too dark to matter whether it was good or bad I could write a massive spiel about the pros and cons of this film. Overall it was an okay watch with some good bits and bad bits.The one and only pertinent factor to me was that any scene that wasn't set in a place bathed in sunlight was too dark. Even if it was taking place in the middle of the day, sometimes you couldn't even make peoples faces out.Thor: Dark World was also far too dark, and yet I think this one takes the cake. Supremely unprofessional filmmaking where they used all budget on big names and flashy effects but couldn't be bothered to check the brightness levels on 70% of the scenes."
1670,4,"Definitely the MCU's weakest movie Eternals had the potential to be a real standout film from the crowd, but it missed out on breaking ranks from its franchise's long-held cliches like 'action scene then funny one-liner' moments that don't feel like character moments anymore, but 'creative mandates' imposed by the studio.It's a BIG movie, so big that it's got too many stories for it's single-movie outline and all these brand-spanking-new characters who desperately needed more character development outside Eternal's 2 and ½ hour runtime. This movie is a 'beautifully made mess': and it's bound to be 'retconned' with a throwaway line of dialogue (or with some jokes) in one of the next Avengers movies like Thor 2 was in Ragnarok.Eternals gets 2/5 stars. It tries to stand out, but it's ultimately more of the same."
1671,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed it Best Marvel movie...no. But we knew that going in. But it has me excited for the future of the MCU. And Angie...still got it. Story was not dull, and action was good. Makes me wanna be a better person."
1672,2,"Just so bad If this indicates things to come from Marvel, then it's all downhill from here. Like below sea level downhill. It was rambling and pointless and couldn't make up its mind what it wants to be. Drama? Comedy? Romance? Doesn't matter- it wasn't successful at any of them. Preachy, scolding, aimless and so boring. Utter waste of time. I really didn't care about any of the characters and found myself actually rooting for the one who was supposed to be the bad guy. Two stars only because I though the Scottish guy playing Ikarus was pretty good."
1673,10,"straight whites stop being babies We all know that if the cast was mostly male, straight and white, this movie would have a 100%, 5 star rating. Those complaining about the ""forced diversity"" and ""wokeness"" of this film don't like seeing portrayals of people who do not look like them on the big screen. Hey, lgbt poc exist! I know it's surprising seeing them lead a marvel film since marvel has not bothered to do it before, but I'd like to ask, will you ever stop complaining about diversity? What does a good diverse movie cast look like to you? Or does that just not exist. This movie, cast aside, was phenomenal and has me and many others excited to see what is in store for phase 4 of the MCU. By all means, if you do not like what you are seeing, feel free to leave, do us all a favor and never buy a ticket to another MCU film ever again. More room in the theater for the rest of us."
1674,10,"Such fun For so many reasons I expected not to enjoy this movie and how wrong I was. Great pacing, great acting, good story, action scenes were spot on and some really emotional scenes which felt real, which for a marvel movie that was an achievement.Fair play."
1675,7,"Feels fresh, if nothing else There are definitely problems here - Lots of characters introduced at once, resulting in most of them being under-developed. The visuals are hit and miss, occasionally being so dark and colorless it feels like a Zack Snyder film, but being really gorgeous at other times. The plot has some holes and some weird decisions by characters that don't seem to make any sense. None of the action scenes are particularly memorable. The pacing is too slow, but at the same time it feels like we don't spend enough time with the characters.But it does have something that all the other Marvel origin-stories don't - the courage to move away from the formula.The story simply develops in ways that are different to previous MCU origin stories. The pacing was different, the plot points were different, the entire style of storytelling was different - and while drifting away from the tried-and-proven formula definitely adds a whole lot of flaws, it also finally gives us a Marvel movie that feels fresh and different.For me - and especially after watching Shang Chi - seeing a Marvel movie where I genuinely don't know for certain what's gonna happen next was really fun, and that's enough for me to give it a positive score."
1676,7,"Superheros on a Grander Scale Marvel has realized that they have to keep things fresh and interesting in the MCU. There has to be new ideas, because as good as everything has been, it will eventually get old. 'Eternals' was a bit risky, but the MCU is so established now it can afford to take that risk, and it continually pays off.The whole concept of the film and it's characters is something different, and on another level when compared to the Avengers. Yes, the movie is long, but not boring; it takes the time it needs to establish this story. 'Eternals' is definitely more catered towards adults, and is actually a sign of Marvel maturing.I suspect why some people may have not liked it, but to each their own. The movie was very diverse, and it makes sense. If you're going to have a group of people living on a planet for 7000 years, you might as well try to fit in everywhere."
1677,7,"A bit long winded It was at least 30 minutes too long, but not as bad a some reviews would have you believe, the main issue I had with it was most of the characters weren't interesting enough."
1678,10,"This is my new favorite marvel movie This movies is absolutely fantatic. But really only for one reason, the movie is great in general but it would be nothing absolutely nothing without the characters, who really drive the plot and story and make it an enjoyable watch. The did a great job giving them all distinct personalities and traits, something I fell marvel has stuggled with in the path. With characters out of the way, the story is good and engaging it makes you want to watch and always wanting to know what comes next . The questions brought up in the movie really make you think and there really is no right answer. To some people the hero's might be villains. And everyone will have there favorite enternall, all in all it was a great film my personal favorite marvel movie, nearly my favorite in general. I highly advise a watch."
1679,4,"Started strong, became a plot mess The beginning had me so hopeful and it just morphed into this cobbled together plot that stopped making any sense. The ending makes no sense in ""the grand concept"" of the universe.It's just ""Rah Rah, we saved earth!! (At the cost of billions of other lives, but hey: Earth is #1) Ugh, really bad. I had no emotional investment in any of these characters. The writers sprinkled in a couple references to the greater MCU, but it seemed forced and out of place. Badly written, bad story, too much current U. S. center social pandering. Not a rewatchable movie for me."
1680,4,"A bit too... much. The Eternals tries breaking MCU ranks whilst suffering from sequel-teasing and not enough narrative breathing room to let the screenplay really shine through the film's many inconsistencies (be it Icarus' arc and the logic of the alien-super-race as the antagonists). This film claims to be more diverse than the rest of the canon, but it's more of the same action-then-punchline stuff some weary viewers just can't shake off any longer. The formula's starting to show its cracks and can't be used to introduce characters for uninitiated viewers like they did with The Avengers or Spider-Man (characters we now have collective knowledge on).The action's nice and big, but the characters don't change, the story feels like it needs 6-7 movies to play out properly, and the in-world logic kind of clashes with everything that happened before (these space-Gods can change little human conflicts in Mesopotamia' but not stop the Snap, Hiroshima or 9/11 because 'natural progress'). So yeah: the spectacle was nice but it didn't make up for the story being an overcooked yet wanting for further development outside of a lone 2 and ½ hour movie introducing too many characters all at once.Eternals: doesn't feel like it's gonna have everlasting appeal in spite of the title. 2/5 stars."
1681,4,"Worst MCU movie so far... I thought Marvel movies could not get worse than Captain Marvel, but sure they did. I am not sure if this was a romcom or a superhero movie. First of all the story does not make sense. What was the point of showing us 30 mins of Ikaris and Sersi's love? And what about Ajak's death? It was all like yeah whatever, she died, lets look for the others...and what about Kingo walking out on everybody, not helping at all in the battle and then appearing again as the bff of everybody? And the biggest question of all: what was the point of showing off the Eternals if you are not going to add Thanos origins to the story? Worst of all, really."
1682,7,"More ""Snyder Cut"" than ""Justice League"" Is this the best MCU movie yet? Not by a long shot. But they manage to establish the Eternals, Celestial, Eros, Black Knight, and Blade and still make it work."
1683,2,Insert huge yawn here Something to fall asleep to or to get rid of the kids. All those pretty ladies and pffft! Nada one shows any skin to make this worth watching. Heck even the old B rated horror movies gave you something to keep you watching.
1684,6,"Hard to get over It was entertaining, but it was hard to get past Ikarus and Jon Snow saying that they loved Sersi. The plot felt a little rushed and overloaded. But still entertaining. Going to be interesting to see where the next movie takes them."
1685,7,"Not a heroe movie The people go in the cinema thinking to find a mind blow experience in terms of heroes movies.But here's where this movie is so different within the MCU, it tells an story more focus in a journey of the characters present in there, and show us how they grow and find themselves in situations where they'll have to make decisions that are simply not in tune with what they think of life.I like to believe this movie it's the beginning of a new dynamic into the MCU, that will give to us, the fans, the chance to watch more complex stories and better argumentative arcs for each character and the upcoming movies."
1686,8,"It definitely falls outside the Marvel formula It feels like a movie with a different and much more mature tone without childish jokes, although it is still funny and will make you laugh several times. It is normal to forget that you are watching something from Marvel, it happened to me several times lol. It may not be to everyone's taste, but at least me and friends who saw it did like that different format."
1687,6,"A mixed bag, not the revolution I was promised by some reviews Sure, there's the great change of tone and scale that's the big good thing here (though there's still a lot of goofing-off type humor, and only half of it lands), but there are so many problems beyond that that I just can't put it up at a 7/10, I have to go lower.Most actors are good here, but casting Hayek as the ""wise leader"" was a catastrophe, she was completely wrong for this role and her acting took me out of the story. Then Nanjiani and Ma were also pretty 'meh' for skill.Beyond the acting, the story had two big blemishes that degraded this movie: pretty much everything with Kingo in it, from his stupid humor to his stupid superpower, and the totally cringe and unconvincing love story between Sersi and Ikaris. I swear I could notice Gemma Chan trying to resist or pull back when Richard was pulling her closer to initiate intimacy, it was horrible to watch.The general ""universe-scale"" events were pretty good though, for those alone I would watch a sequel, but I did not come out of this satisfied that I spent cinema ticket money on it, I'm definitely skipping the cinema next time and waiting for the sequel to get on streaming platforms.Hey, at least now we know of a second way (after GoT) to misspell the name of Greek goddess Circe."
1688,9,"I liked it! I know some people would disagree. But, I thought it was a good movie. I saw it in 3D twice. The action was pretty good. I loved the ending. And I liked how they're introducing characters that are apart of the Marvel Universe."
1689,3,"Boring and nothing like other Marvel movies Eternals is the first movie I watched in cinema during the pandemic. I have been a fan of MCU since Ironman 1, but I've never seen a boring movie as this one. It's like never ending patho story with lot of glue scenes and same scenes with different visuals. I am disappointed with this movie and hope I don't see another boring movie from MCU. FYI, I do read Marvel comics which is much much better!"
1690,1,Give me back my 2 and half hours A totally wasted two and half hours. I want my money back. Boring as heck. You won't get what you would normally expect from an mcu movie. Would not recommend anyone to waste their precious time on this movie.
1691,2,"What a mess !!!!! Usually i am not into writing movie reviews but Eternals made me to create an account on IMDb just to share my sheer disappointment 😞 and this review is from a normal audience's POV, not a comic book lover's.First of all, no disrespect to Chloe but from the beginning to the end, the only credible thing from her direction is the documentation of the locations like we see in National Geography. Other than that i didn't find her pace of direction for a Superhero Movie anything mention worthy 😞 since 2008 we have been associated with the MCU through Iron Man and we have seen how the stories have been building with each movie. But for Eternals, till the end i wasn't sure what was their purpose and what Ikeris was trying to do and why he just flew to the sun 🙄 the screenplay was just rip off of X-Men, Transformers. Arishem's monologues were just like what Optimus Prime used to sprout about humanity, planet and bla bla bla but more monotonous that made you just skip it just because they were that boring.The pace of the movie was like a turtle learning to walk. Chloe could have done a lot more in the time she wasted just on Ikeris and Sersi, could have given the others some more screentime to establish their stories but no, she wasted footage on Ikeris walking behind Sersi like a lovesick puppy, a love story of ancient times which was quite unnecessary because of the slow pace.Let's talk about the acting. This movie is the proof that not all movies with A list cast are the absolute best. The only persons who showed some personality were Kit, Lauren and Kumail. Rest of them including Angelina Jolie spent majority of their screentime crying. A superhero movie with crying Superheros, i couldn't digest it. When Loki and Iron Man died there wasn't a single person without tears in the theater, could hear the gasp and cleaning runny noses. But for Eternals, when Ajak/Gilgamesh died no reaction, why? Because people were already fade up with the on goings. I still cannot believe Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie agreed to this script where the writers themselves didn't know what the hell they were doing including the director. Salma's role was of no impact on screen because she died in the beginning and the flashbacks didn't give enough justification to her character as a leader. Same goes for Angelina, all she did either cry or fight, that too in brief scenes. Lauren was the most efficient in her role and the little screentime she got, she shined. Same for Kumail but his Bollywood number was the worst thing that could be described as a Bollywood number, that too with 4 months of practice 😴. Throughout the movie all Gemma Chang did was put on worried expressions and cry. And Richard Madden's Ikeris was awesome when fighting but that's the only likable part of that character. Sprite was also there for comic relief but it didn't happen much. Druid somehow was at least given some justification for his behavior and all Gilgamesh did was punching Deviants. Then comes the most controversial character as per the MCU people, Phastos who is the first ever black and gay superhero. Marvel made such a spectacle over this and bam...in the movie there's nothing of that spectacle. People are already pretty used to gay couples so they haven't seen something new. This is something pretty normal. But the actors portraying that gay couple have made such a huge deal out of it that you gonna feel something monumental has happened.Now let's talk bout the Deviants. Till date i haven't understood what they wanted to do. And how they were able to go to all the locations the Eternals were going. And they just looked like the dragon from Shang Chi, and one exactly looked like Toothless from how to train ur Dragon, and the boss deviant just looked like Voldemort. So the CGI team just took some characters from other movies, added brunches to their features and gave them the name of Deviants, that's it.And the only mentionable fight scene is when Makkari was beating the hell out of Ikeris. Rest of the fights even the fighting with Deviants are so forgettable. And that UniMind thing, at that point of the movie, it looked more bullshitty. What a rubbish final showdown.Another mention, the ancient peoples. They way Chloe captured all those scenes were like they were doing theaters as background actors, the people showed no emotions, i guess they were told just be there and do nothing.The saddest part is that when i watched their press, none of the actors were even remotely aware about their characters, they only knew text book versions of their powers, didn't do any character study and after watching the movie, i realized why would they invest themselves into deep study when their script is rubbish. Only the name MCU and the title of superhero along with the paycheck was important than character developing. Also Kumail and Salma did most of the press because they could make comedy out of everything when it should have been Gemma and Richard. But every interview they did, all same, so boring. And their overpraise for Chloe Zhao now seems so shallow cause no one who knows good scripts would be praising this script.I could go on ranting more and that shows how disappointed i am over this movie,"
1692,4,"A long movie with too many plot holes I'm not sure what insults the viewer more, the nonsense plot or asking us to believe in a ""superhero"" created by the hand of what is essentially God, and yet can't speak. A superhero forced to use sign language because the producers of this film thought forced diversity was a better direction to go than telling a good story."
1693,5,"Unimpressed Don't get me wrong, I love when a film has people of all walks of life in its story, but this movie felt like forced inclusion. The diversity, although always appreciated, felt shoehorned into the narrative of the film. The story was just good enough, there were way too many characters and the movie kept in continuously.jumping through timelines with 10 characters that the movie needed to feature. This was a prefect plot for a Disney plus show but not a feature length filmNow for the good: The film had stunning visuals, excellent actings by a super talented cast which is consistent with all MCU flicks. However, the ending was quite lacklustre."
1694,4,"A wannabe Avengers movie that fails on all fronts, wasting its considerable cast. Marvel's ""The Eternals"" is a feeble attempt to enlist new group of superheroes we are supposed to care about. After living with the Avengers so many many years and getting used to familiar faces, we are now presented with a new team of superheroes, or should I say deities, that are obviously supposed to replace the avengers. Unfortunately non of the characters or actors come even close to the Avengers.The Eternals is overloaded with dialogue and information. We are told many things half of which we forget. The movie starts of quite well with the first battle the Eternals fight on earth, they are send there to protect, you see, against so called deviants. Next wee see Sersi (Gemma Chan) with her boyfriend Dane (Kit Harrington) in London. The deviants have been vanquished for thousands of years now and the Eternals live peaceful lives on earth. All of the sudden a Deviant appears in the Themse and starts attacking the city. Soon Sersi and her fellow Eternal Sprite, start fighting it and discovering a new breed of Deviant.I am going to leave you here with the plot as it is best to let you discover it for yourself as predictable and slow as it may be.We are introduced to the different members through flashbacks which occur all bhourhgut the movie. Unfortunately, this greatly disrupts the story and structure of the movie, not always knowing if we are in the present or past. I never understood why directors insist on splitting the flashback sequences into so many little parts instead of giving us a full account in the begging of the movie. That way we would have a full account of the characters and understand them better as we went along.I felt confused and frustrated by them movie. Partly because the characters were so incredibly dull and on the other hand because the cast, as good as it may be, was so underused. Harrington especially.We all know him as the brooding, fighting hero from Game of Thrones, but here he takes on a quite different role and it is so refreshing. He only has a few minutes of screen time but that's enough for us, to long to see more of him. His comic timing is spot on. He feels at home in the world and seeing him in normal clothes and short hair brings a refreshing change to his persona. Unfortunately not all of the cast members are as convincing. Richard Madden for example, Harrington's co-star in GOT, doesn't seem to be very comfortable in the movie. Every time we see him in the first hour his performance is wooden and he is as stiff as a plank. In fact none of the Eternals appear to have any chemistry with each other. Neither the actors nor the characters. They feel like random characters thrown together to form unit, but not knowing how. The cast, in case you don't know, consists of bights like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek or Kumail Nanjiani. None of them can bring their considerable talents to the movie, given their characters are completely flat and boring.""Eternals"" tries hard to be a new Avengers movie, but the lack of background and missing of credible threat make them seem like a bunch of gods wanting to stir up trouble. Chloe Zao is an incredible director and she deserved her Oscar this year. I am sure she gives her best here but even she can't make much of a script as confused and messy as this one.Should there be another movie, I do hope they share more of the characters backgrounds and make it more entraining this one. I am hoping for more refined action sequences and less dialogue, letting the characters speak for themselves."
1695,9,"not as bad as people say..... Sure...could have been better.......but this is a action movie .the characters were good,humor was funny. Just learn to enjoy movies people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1696,1,"Horrible Trying to be ""deep"", the director uses some long shots (or longer than usual in the MCU) here and there, less frenetic editing here and there, and less Marvel humor (there is enough though), in a thing that turned to be a really, really bad experiment. Valient effort though?In the end, none of that matters that much because the biggest problems with the movie are the simple things. The are way too many characters, and they are all flat and not particularly interesting (maybe because there is not time to develop them); the interpretations from the most important ones, the leads, robotic and soulless, which didn't help; the story told in unnecessary back and forth, maybe as an attempt to make it seem more complex than it was, and as a result not letting the movie to get into any rhythm; finally, contrary to what I read a lot, the special effects, the desings of the powers and suits and the actions scenes were just bad, too simple or with awful CGI.Other than that, it was great(?)"
1697,7,"I want to love it Eternals was a film that did several things new for the MCU. It doesn't particularly feel like an MCU movie, which is a good thing. It has its own distinct flare while managing to stay away from the cookie-cutter movies that they've cranked out for so long. For this, the film deserves credit. It tries to be something more introspective, something that tries to be something more than a regular superhero movie, to varying degrees of success.The idea of superheroes questioning their purpose here has been done before, but it was done well here. Them being torn between loyalty to Arishem and their love for Earth is nothing new, but it resulted in the movie lacking a proper villain, which was welcome in a franchise where not only are villains hit or miss, but where the ideas of heroism and villainy are very black and white. Even in Civil War, Zemo was still there as an unquestionable villain. Here, there is a case to be made for anyone to be right. The scenes with Druig trying to take control were interesting conceptually, another idea of duty as opposed to personal belief. The general introspective nature of the film isn't perfect, but it's good for what it is. It has pacing issues, that's for certain. It is very exposition-heavy, but it immerses the audience in its world to the point where it's not too bad. The film's score was epic, by Ramin Djwadi, adding to the dozens of Game of Thrones connections this movie has.The characters feel like cheap dollar store versions of more popular characters. Sersi was dollar store Wonder Woman, Ikarus is dollar store Superman, Phastos is dollar store Cyborg (or his dad, more accurately), Sprite is dollar store Loki (although she reminds me more of Morgana from Persona 5), Makkari is dollar store Flash/Quicksilver, and others were just kind of bland. You could write Gilgamesh and Makkari out of this movie and it would be the same. Klingo was a good comic relief, although there are some cringey moments. It's still Marvel humor, but it's on the better end of Marvel humor. Thena... I don't know what to make of. Conceptually interesting, but I'm not sure about Angelina Jolie being cast as her.The direction of Chloe Zhao was something that drew a lot of attention. As the reigning Best Director winner, there's quite a bit of pressure. She was a good choice for direction. Its quiet moments, the very thing Zhao specializes in yet the antithesis of what Marvel stands for, were mostly handled well, and they didn't detract from its action sequences. And with this, she has established herself as someone who can be both director as artist (Nomadland), and director as entertainer (Eternals). Some of the shots, both CGI and not, in the movie were incredible, something that Zhao specializes in. Babylon was gorgeous. The scenes of nature are too. Arishem was fascinating to look at.I want to love this movie. As it stands, I can't. This would've been far better off as a TV show. That way, it would have more time to expand on the things it couldn't fit into its runtime and strengthening the bonds between the characters and the characters themselves. If it keeps its interesting concepts, incredible visuals, introspective, nature, and epic score, it would possibly be the best of the Marvel shows. Unfortunately though, this is what we got, for better or for worse. It's not the worst MCU movie. It's better than Dark World, Captain Marvel, heck even Black Widow."
1698,6,"Eternals Review Is it as bad as the critics are saying? No. Is it a film that breaks the boundaries of a Marvel film? Also no. Eternals is in this weird limbo where there is a lot of stuff I like but for everything I liked, there was something I didn't like. The film's visuals and directing are honestly some of the best in the series. The environments and shots look consistently great. Sometimes there is the awkward visual effect but that's expected at this point in Marvel. The music is pretty good at points but very forgettable at others which sucks because the good pieces are really gold but the bad pieces are really bad. Half of these characters I found interesting (Sersi, Ikaris, Sprite, Gilgamesh, and Druig) while the other half I found to be boring and uninteresting. Chloé Zhao is a great director but I'm not a big fan of her writing. I feel the same way about her previous film Nomadland. There is a lot of exposition that can be interesting sometimes when combined with the pretty visuals but also really boring. Sometimes they prioritize the exposition over character work which is one of the reasons I found some of these characters to be uninteresting. The action is this way as well where it can be really fun and different sometimes but other times it does nothing to stand out from other Marvel films. I am glad Marvel tried to do something much different. I truly am but it definitely could have been done better. I really hope the negative critical reception doesn't disuade Marvel from making something different in the future. I would really only recommend this if you are big into Marvel movies."
1699,4,"Superproduction with no content Is like when you recieved a very beatiful gift box and you open and you have nothing inside. The 4 stars are for the box.The story is absolutely uncredible with so many unneccesary twists!None of the characters is round, eventhough there are very good actors, it seems so fake everyone!Marvel should start to take care much more on the content and not produce just for the money!I have several friends that stop watching Marvel films, I am about to do the same!!!"
1700,9,"Good story, good plot Very good. I think it is more enjoyable for the older audiece, as it can be hard to keep track on everything as the movie progresses. The story is amazing, and i love all the time jumps back in time."
1701,5,"Conflicted I love the concept of the movie, I do not think it lived up even close to its potential. With that being said, the visuals are breathtaking! It is just too bad that the film pulls our attention away with the typical ""hit-or-miss"" jokes (which in my opinion should have been reserved solely for Kumail Nanjiani's character) as well as various other themes that dragged this movie out for a total of 2 hours and 30+ minutes. The action scenes were more or less the same sequences every time... I felt like I was graphically being dragged along for the copious amount of locations that were used/presented...You be the judge ;)"
1702,1,"A Marvel Sex Scene? 1/10 What is Marvel bringing in a full nude sex scene for? We haven't seen anything like this since the original Iron Man, after which Disney purchased Marvel and the movies became more family friendly. Eternals lead the way for more inappropriate movies going forward.Mainly 1/10 for that, but also for a couple additional clichés that are now becoming Marvel standard: 1) a comic relief character that frequently degrades the seriousness of scenes throughout the move, 2) a big boss defeated right at the end of the movie, 3) another new ""higher power"". Infinity stones, to multiverse, to Celestials.Take out the sex scene, I probably would give it a 6/10 for standard Marvel action but nothing particularly fantastic."
1703,6,Not Too Great People who are bashing the movie are mostly just hating on it cause everyone else is hating on the movie. I saw the movie opening weekend and I thought it wasn't too bad. The only thing that kept bringing the movie down was that it had 10 characters. The movie kept trying to do so many things and connect us with each character that it never really did any of them great. The graphics and fight scenes were really cool and the weight of the characters in the MCU was pretty well explained and cool. It's also funny how every time Disney has a new marvel character movie like this one they have to explain why they weren't part of the fight for Thanos like they did with Captain Marvel.
1704,4,"No reason to connect to the film or characters Bland and a waste of excellent acting talent. Felt like reading the dictionary. I understand the setup to start a new timeline, but that could have been done in 15 minutes.Visually nice, but acting seemed hollow and uninspiring, and whomever decides on the monsters look in MCU should be fired. They all look the same!Boring!"
1705,1,"Who paid for positive reviews? This movie was such a disappointment compared to all the other marvel movies. It didn't feel the same. The sex scene felt out of the blue and not necessary. (I'm not a prude by any means, it just didn't fit.)"
1706,3,"Tired old plot lines Was hopeful with this film thinking that Marvel would change tracks and show a different, collaborative film. Well, unfortunately, they continued with the tired old plots they constantly hammered in the Avenger films with constant internal strife, conflict and showing this type of me me me me and not about working for something bigger than yourself plots. So, I got bored with this film in the first 20 min.If you have seen this film, you know this can go either way in how the characters could deal with main antagonist.Hopefully, Marvel/Disney will come up with something more helpful and inspiring rather than recycling the same plot over and over again in the future."
1707,1,Worst MCU Movie The story was very bad. Too long and too messy. Very hard to understand what was happening. Hate it. MCU is loosing quality. I guess they are inmune to box office because they made money. Don't think everyone liked it.
1708,5,"If I could describe the movie in one word, it would be a mess Not a major Marvel fan, but I decided to check this movie out with my mom, who, on the other hand, loves Marvel a lot. Sadly neither of us liked it. I thought it was a mess. The plot makes no sense whatsoever. So in the movie, there are the eternals - aliens that look like humans, but they have super powers and are immortal. They've been protecting regular people for thousands of years from other aliens creatures called Deviants. But suddenly one of these deviants returns to Earth, to be more specific London. But why would they kill human beings? Well, according to Arishem, some kind of a god called Celestial, if the population reaches a certain number, the Earth will be destroyed and a new celestial will be born. Isn't this plot confusing already? And that's just the beginning. Also Sersi became the chosen eternal to communicate with a god like creature, because something happened to Ajak, the previous leader of the team. The rest is spoilersMost of the flashbacks felt out of place and randomly added without any order. All of the characters are bland and forgetable. Sometimes it was interesting though. For example, Phastos wanting to advance the human civilization with his creations or Thena, who didn't want her memory to be erased. And one joke made me laugh about Sersi's boyfriend. I also appreciate the special effects. Sadly, for the most part, is boring and not like your typical Marvel. Not terrible, just boring. The worst thing I can say about it is that it's way too long. Can you actually sit through 2 and a half of hours of this nonsense? For some reason, me and my mom did it, but it wasn't worth it and we felt tired after watching it. I don't think even Jolie fans would enjoy this film. So, you can skip this film if you want, if you still have a wish to see it, then you can, but don't expect much and don't expect your average Marvel movie."
1709,6,"It could be way better and quite less boring.... I've seen all the MCU movies. The main problems with Eternals are:(a) Salma Hayek had a very weak performance. She doesn't look so strong or wise or anything tbh. And the CGI effects of her (healing, fighting), a bit silly. She couldn't convince me for a second that she even tried. Look at Angelina Jolie on the other hand: She's an established actress but still tried hard to give a good performance, trying to show all the angles of Thena.(b) Movie repeats several aspects of a previous MCU film (Captain Marvel). Main heroes fighting for the wrong side without knowing it, amnesia preventing protagonist(s) knowing the truth, mother-figure dying and this makes the protagonist to become something bigger, protagonist's lover/caring person is actually a bad guy.(c) Movie copies a whole scene from another MCU film (XMen: Apocalypse): Makkari punches at fast forward Icarus before being countered, which is exactly what happens with Quicksilver beating En Sabah Nur before get countered too.(d) Movie repeats some of.... Marvel's TV series theme (Loki): The heroes send to earth are working on a plan they don't understand, a plan that was conceived by a mastermind. Again there's a plot twist with amnesia while there's also an unsolved ethical pseudo-dillema about life, that masterminds asks everybody to solve. On Eternals, they have to choose if they want new worlds to be created or they want earth to survive. On Loki, they have to choose between free will or total chaos.(e) Characters act very differently compared to their backstory: Ajak is growing conscience after destroying inifinite number of planets over the aeons. It's like Darth Vader being a saint because although he committed genocide with the Death Star, he changed his mind in the very last moment.Kingo seems to be the person who interacts the most with the human race, but still he's the only one who chooses to be neutral on the dilemma to save or not the earth.Phestos has a child, and still prefers not to fight for its survival until his partner tells him to do so. Very unrealistic.Sprite backstabs Sersi, but literally 15 minutes later, they are best friends without even mentioning the incident!Those are minor and major glitches, but ofc, this doesn't mean that the movie is bad. It has entertaining moments like the Kingo/Karun interactions (an immortal with his human friend) which reminded me a bit of the Highlander franchise. Nice graphics, not a great plot twist (I hoped the monster who sucked the superpowers from everybody to be the hero that would have saved the earth). In general, a very nice part of every superhero movie, is the part that shows the birth or the skills of every individual. Robocop saving a random woman by shooting between here legs, Superman saving a bus with laser sight or so, etc. On Eternals, even with different abilities, all heroes look the same. They are boring, they lack real personality and ability to take initiatives. And the pace of the move, very slow... Not good for MCU movie..."
1710,2,"Never watching again This movie felt like a waste of potential and time. Definitely the worst marvel movie because of the slow predictable plot. Some characters had so much more potential and the others dragged them down. Compared to all previous marvel characters, the eternals are exponentially weak. The only good character from this movie was Dane, and I hope to see his outcome. (On a side note: the credit scene was bad as well) I totally hope that this movie is very unimportant and useless. I'm sorry Stan Lee that this has happened in the absence of your guidance."
1711,3,Just...not good. Too many characters too fast to care about them then too long of a movie. Also the relationship with the celestial is odd. How do they care so much for a being that they seem to barely understand. Then the ending that wasn't an ending and deviants that weren't what they seemed cut off abruptly.
1712,1,Boring This movie moves slowly. No cares about the main characters because they are no likable. They complain the entire movie. You end up rooting for the bad guys. A complete waste of time!
1713,1,"Amazingly long and boring What is happening with Marvel ?Worst Marvel movie in Years and years.... Long, boring and childish... It could be a nice begging of new stories but it's poorly executed.Hope they can improve on this one."
1714,1,"Zzzzz Boring! I literally dozed off. I was very disappointed overall. Honestly, this movie was cheesy and dragged on. Marvel now lacks consistency. I couldn't help but think this movie was nothing more than a money grab. Some people are giving it a 10/10! How? Simple minds I guess."
1715,6,"Meh story done with Marvel Quality Overall the Eternals was an okay movie. I enjoyed the spectacular special effects that Marvel always treats us with. But fancy effects can't make up for a poor story. And Eternals is just that, poor. I found to story to be slow and boring. Many elements initially seemed significant but it made little sense when they ended up having had no impact on the story."
1716,1,"i have to agree with all the people who got this right and gave it one star and the deserving negative reviews Maybe finally Marvel has lost its way, after three very bad TV shows we now get this. A dull, lifeless, energy pulling mess of a film. As other have said no chemistry, no decent characters a waste of good actors who have a rubbish and talky script to content with, a grey dull look to the film. It was like wathcing a blank screen, you are seeing something in front of you but it is not saying or doing anything, it certainly not moving you in any way, and the repeated failed attempts at humour. The only thing it does, again in a bad way is tick of all the woke and pc boxes. I thought Wonder Woman 1984 was bad this made that look passable."
1717,7,"We expect better from Marvel It's an uphill task for Marvel to continue making movies. Infinity war, end game and Loki series had set a very high standard.Eternals is an average movies. Too many characters. Would have been better if they had focused on a few characters. Deviant are interesting and powerful charector but the script doesn't do justice."
1718,8,"Marvel's ""The Last Jedi"" This is such a weird feeling I have because I both liked and disliked portions of this film.The first act was just so boring and didn't have any emotion or spunk. A lot of the characters were both likable and unlikable. Sprite (or something) stood there with a ""rbf"" the entire film, which sounds rude because the actor's a kid, but like I don't know how else to describe it. Kingo was just so annoying and many of his jokes just didn't hit their mark. I honestly liked his sidekick documentarian so much more. Cersei was just kind of there and didn't really resonate much with me outside of plot convenience.And then there were the more likable characters. Phastos was great and fun, but we didn't get much from him. Same with Ajak, who was really important, emotional, and great, but she wasn't really present in a lot of the film.I found that the more I liked a character, the less screen time they had.Now to get to the better parts. The cinematography, as said earlier, and the second two acts really immersed me into the story. The fight scenes started off okay, but really picked up pacing, and drove some emotional impact forward during each sequence. It was really great. Not to mention also the amazing visuals of the celestials. Wow, they made me feel so small and weak, and made such a powerful presence on screen. And Ikaris, such a cool and understandable character.I felt like I couldn't choose a side in setting up the finale because both sides felt reasonable to an extent. And the deviants always looked pretty cool and had an interesting build up to a very intense finale.Again, a very mixed film, with some of the best and worst from Marvel. I think I'm giving it a 4/5 because I know that the future can have some potentially amazing storytelling thanks to Chloe Zhao. And also the positives absolutely annihilated the negative aspects of this film. Definitely do recommend it, but please keep an open mind.Long story short, this feels like Marvel's ""The Last Jedi"" and I'm here for it. Gonna divide a lot of people, but stands fairly well on its own."
1719,2,"Boring. One the worse MCU movie of all time!!! TBH...this movie is far below fun and excitement compares to Avengers. Sleepy over the 1st half. Fighting over CG monsters is boring. Kissing or make love scenes are unnecessary or the director can not create smooth scenes. Jokes are not funny and movie are sucks!!! I'm a big fan of MCU, but this Eternals upsets me. I don't understand why some people can give high rating on this or they are paid AI from MCU. Please make carefully make better movie, MCU."
1720,3,"Everything was forced First, the good parts. The visual effects in some of the scenes were amazing and if only they had more of it, it would have been great. The few problems I have with this movie is how forced it felt. The forced comedy (thank god they didn't forced Indian accent on the Indian characters though), second, so many tears so often. And it felt forced for almost all the time. Another major drawback was chemistry between characters, they had none. Neither friendship nor love felt real. It was un-Marvel like. Third, there was a change of heart by lead character and the only explanation was some cliches such we they have seen so many good things in people and so on but there were no scenes portrayed that connect which was created by humans being humans. And you guys had Angelina Jolie and you wasted it! Unforgivable. There are some basic plot line gaps, some illogical explanations about their avoidance in interfering during Thanos and other catastrophic events which really makes this one a dud. Avoid it as it has no relevance to rest of the MCU and you are likely to miss nothing whatsoever."
1721,2,"Whoever thought this was a good idea to release needs to leave Marvel. Very minor spoilers.This is easily Marvel's worst film yet. Almost everything about this is trash; the script is trash, the story is trash, the cinematography is typically boring Marvel trash, and holy crap Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. These two CAN NOT ACT for the LIFE of them in this movie.But first, the positive.I did like Kumail Nanjiani. He and Harish Patel do deliver some funny one liners throughout the film so I commemorate them for bringing some humour to the film. I liked Lia Mchugh and Bryan Tyree Henry too - both acted pretty well and I think Marvel did it good by introducing a gay couple without making a massive fuss over it.And lastly, the action choreography was pretty good.Anyway, Gemma Chang and Madden 2k21 CAN NOT act FOR THE LIFE OF THEM. While I can't speak for their vocal delivery since I watched this in the spanish dub (which is always awful, by the way) they dont have any variation in facial expression like whatsoever. THEIR FACES BARELY CHANGE FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE. The only thing Gemma Chan can do somewhat decently is cry on command. That is literally it.Barry Keoghan had a really poor performance in this film, but I really think that's down to the script more than anything else; I know this guy can act from his performance in Dunkirk for example but here watching him act was just a giant wtf happened moment.Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie had really boring performances - and about Angelina Jolie, i literally thought she was meant to be crippled or something because during the scene where they were all eating right after she rembered (😇) she did not say a single fucking line and all she did was laugh at a few things. The way the shots were edited in that scene simply told me she was not quite there mentally - then in the next few scenes she starts talking normally like she didn't just sit there and laugh at random things a scene before? Like bruh.Ma Dong-Seok, another actor I KNOW is good, also delivers a subpar performance here. Lauren Ridloff, while she has facial expressions, they're a little over the top sometimes and mad forced. Also, her and Barry's character's romance was so sudden and forced it just made me think the scriptwriter just wanted to have as many characters paired up as possible.Now then, the CG. The babylon fight scene while well done (action wise) it also looked straight out of a video game. The camera movements were too quick and too smooth at the same time and the wendigo-looking Deviants looked fake as fuck. Plus, the colour saturation for the Babylonian walls was way too pronounced, just brough the whole scene down even further. Another iffy CG thing was the troll thing during the post credits scene where Starfox is introduced. It also looked fake as fuck.Otherwise the CGI was the boring standard you expect from Marvel.Overall, this movie was one of the worst of the year (nothing will beat 'Karen') and Marvel's worst movie yet. From the very beginning, when they had TEXT scrolling along explaining the lore Star Wars-style, I was already thinking ""man, fat L to that opening."" (Not to mention the fat L the movie took after the first fight scene was over and they were all 'bonding' with the mesopotamians, that's what told me Gemma Chang can not act). I'll rewatch this later but in English so I can see how their vocal delivery is as I cannot gauge how it is from the ever shitty Spanish dub.2/10."
1722,5,"Meh Convoluted, confusing, all over the place and full of strange and weird creative decisions. 2h30 and it's still feels way undercooked.However, it's not a complete disaster. Gemma Chan is a bless, the visuals are spectacular and the fights are exciting."
1723,7,"Too much plot This is frustrating as it does a lot very well. Characters are quickly established along with their power sets and the back story is set pretty well. Loved seeing the ancient civilizations, the hanging gardens of Babylon etc. It is BEAUTIFUL at times.But where it misses, is that there is too much to get done. Because of this, the big dramatic twists and betrayals don't land as we haven't spent enough time with them to care about the characters and their relationships yet. There is also some subplot about a super-evolved deviant but that kind of just happens, with no real reason.I feel there should have been a whole film of them together, maybe trying to defeat the mutant deviant with the reason for its existence being related to the mystery of their true purpose on Earth with hints that things are not as they seem. We then get to know them and care about them and their relationships. Thena's space dementia can then be used as some kind of ominous foreboding rather than it just being kinda there.The sequel then rips this all apart with the big reveal of their true purpose and starts breaking them up and killing them off as per the second half of this film. The difference being that this time it means something to us.But I'm no script writer so what do I know?"
1724,5,"Felt short, but excited for the future I am a huge marvel fan and I have enjoyed every movie since it started but this one 😬 I think I came in expecting more of the Eternals that what was shown. The action scenes were awesome, but there were a few scenes (more than necessary) that put you to sleep. I also understand that this is the beginning of the Eternals, so I know the next one will be better. And the actors were on point, great job from every single one of them. I think the problem was the writing, it was funny, serious and it had action but there were a few cringy scenes. All on all for me it's a 5, maybe when I see it again I will change my mind."
1725,9,"One of the best Marvel movies I was pleasantly surprised; I expected something bad, after reading the reviews, but this movie was amazing!This movie has a good storyline, great actors, decor and outfits are amazing and I like the fact that it is really something different. It makes me excited for all of phase 4 of the MCU.I really don't understand why some people say it is 'too slow'. This movie introduces a lot of new characters and a lot of information. It would be totally unrealistic if it went by faster, and they wouldn't be able to show us enough context. Especially since it is the beginning of a new 'era' in the MCU; they couldn't rush it."
1726,2,"Worse marvel movie The worst film from the marvel studio watched it through force, I do not advise anyone to watch it, but especially to go to the cinema at it, the film where God is killed by the universe is so simple ... it's just horror."
1727,2,"Excruciating A very long, torturous, dull experience. Normally I love a good MCU flick but this was absolutely dreadful. It was somber and pretentious with none of the light-hearted joy that makes Marvel movies such a pleasure.Minimal character development or plot. Wooden, painful acting with no chemistry among the characters. It dragged on and on; I just begged for it to end. Absolutely the worst MCU film ever, and probably one of the worst movies of 2021."
1728,7,"Most beautiful mcu movie. Yeah....it is the most beautiful mcu movie u ll come across.....the former most beautiful mcu movie was BLACK PANTHER. But ETERNALS now claims the 1st position in it. The movie doesn't seem like an MCU movie....and we all are aware that the solo superhero mcu movies are little off and slow in their narration like Captain America, Captain marvel, Thor....so yeah it was a big gamble with this one too because for the the first time mcu has introduced a group of superheros together in a big budgeted movie like ETERNALS. So they have to build up each and every character upto some extent so that the audience can connect with them so that did tale some time and made the movie little slow or ypu can say off otherwise,beautiful direction from Chloe zao. Her knowledge on camera angles with the scenes are unmatchable. Definitely we want a sequel to clearly process these semi gods with our beloved AVENGERS."
1729,4,Dark and dull Many of the scenes were shot in the dark so hard to see what's going on on the screen. The storyline was just so-so not super exciting. Lots of CG in this film. The new addition super hero in this film are not memorable. Marvel has too many super hero movies & the story needs to be creative to get audience's attention. Definitely not this film....
1730,8,"far from a bad super-hero movie and worth being seen on large screens. Reviews on this movie are far harsher than it deserve.First of all this is really a comic fan movie. It feels like Chloe Zhao and Kevin Feige really wanted to pay homage to Jack Kirby through making a movie on characters that he could claim sole responsibility for and not having had to share the credits with Stan Lee. However the whole concept did not really fit into the marvel universe. It came at a time when Jim Starlin was developing the Marvel cosmic universe (with among others Thanos) and Kirby's concept did not really fit into it. Later on, some concept from the book were reused by other comics creators but basically the Eternals remained on the sidelines seldom mingling with other SH.So we have a concept which from the start is difficult to shoe in the Marvel cinematic universe. One way to do it was to have a story that focused on human history before the advent of the super-hero time that as we know in the cinematic universe starts with Iron Man. So the story tries to link the Eternals to the myths and heroes of the past : Gilgamesh, Athena, Icarus etc...It does somewhat work although trying to encompass the whole of humanity's longing for stories in only 2 hours is just mission impossible.As a result the characters are quite strange in the sense that they clearly aren't humans in nature and yet end up having feeling and irrational thoughts just as if they were. This issue is never explained during the movie. We do not know whether empathy, love, sense of duty, ire, need for explanation and conflicting stance on finding the meaning of their lives is something that was in them from the start or something that they caught after sharing millenniums walking alongside humans.However the nice thing about the story is that it does not conform to the now overused action hero with its five act storytelling formula. It reminded me rather of a Shakespearean plot where tragedy is here from the onset while being either hidden from the characters' comprehension or willingly set aside by a sense of duty or willed delusion.The movie is excellent for its settings. The places that Zhao choose are just breathtakingly beautiful. They make for a very nice visual experience on a large screen.Actors are playing really well. I really enjoyed also the fact that it felt as if they were not plastered with obvious and multiple layers of make-up. The all-inclusive nature of the cast doesn't feel fake at all and relationship between them really works well. On the downside they never feel lively. This is probably due to the fact that the conundrum of having non human beings acting as humans is neither explained nor explored. So they end up looking stiff and dispassionate while their actions are showing that they are concerned and full of doubts.Now action scenes are quite classic. Nothing really impressive on the screen here. FX are streamlined and kept to a bare minimum something that I appreciated, the only bad one comes during the first post-credit scene with Pip who's looking fake from start to end.All in all not an unpleasant experience at all even though it lacks the rush of adrenaline that one can feel when submerged with actions in traditional hollywood action movies. It doesn't also offer any kind of food for thought on what acting as a human is nor does it amend of confirm the stance that with great power comes great responsibility."
1731,3,"Please, stop this ... This movie is complete mess. To many characters with not enough time get attached to anyone. Only Gilgamesh and Tina's story was somewhat intriguing. Bad acting all over the place. Many logical plotholes. Building a plot to end just like that, without any consequences or clojure, its just sloppy writing. As a big fan of the MCU i dont see this movie clicking with the rest of the lore. Not sure what's going on backstage in Disney, but for sure this was not synced with Feigi or there is a 3rd party agenda which is propagated here. If you are an MCU fan, you are going to be dissapointed. If you are an action movie fan, you are going to be dissapointed. Would not recommend it..."
1732,3,"Not worthy to be in the Marvel series I own every Marvel Movie but will not buy Eternals as it is NOT on par with other Marvel series movies.The story line is all over the place and out of place with the Marvel series movies. The actors had little to no physical training, no fighting choreography training, like other marvel movies, just watch how other marvel movies were made and the training the actors had gone through. Chemistry between actors, what chemistry? Who oversaw picking actors for the parts they had? Angelina Jolie was about the only person/ actress who actually was convincing.Special graphics were horrible. Example would be the main supreme being/ god they have.Even the previews looked cheesy when all the Eternals are standing together, but I figured it must be better than the previews since it's part of the Marvel series, boy was I wrong. What a waste of time and money to have seen in the Movie theater."
1733,7,"GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC After reading so many negative reviews I really thought I was going to find it very boring. I was wrong. The idea itself is really fascinating. There is a duality behind the idea that makes you question wether what they are doing is a good or a bad thing. The main problem for me were the eternals themselves. Aside from Angelina Jolie's character I found all of them way too goofy and humane to be gods. Same thing with Kang the conqueror from Loki, I was a expecting a divine and mighty higher dimensional being.Overall it is a fantastic concept and it opens the door to even more marvel characters and stories. It is entertaining but nothing out of the ordinary."
1734,10,"Eternals The main thing people are being critical about in this movie is how boring and long it was. I will admit, they probably could have cut a half hour out of the movie and it would have been fine. People felt it took too long to find and fully introduce the characters. But I felt it was 100% necessary for the story. This movie had a lot of characters, and it took place over 7,000 years. They needed to introduce and explain what all 10 characters did in those years. Also, we have never seen the Eternals before. In a movie like Endgame or Infinity War, it is full of characters we have all seen and gotten to know, so they don't have to spend a lot of time introducing the characters because that has already been done. But in this movie, there are 10 new heroes we have never seen and know nothing about, so they needed to spend the time introducing everyone. I felt they did a great job at it. This movie also didn't really feel like a Marvel movie. It is all because of positive reasons, like the visuals, how unique it was, the characters, and how ambitious the creators made it. Chloé Zhao is unbelievable. This movie was visually stunning. Her style of directing is so unique. She doesn't use very much green/blue screen, most of the scenes are shot on location, and you could tell. The scenes were so beautiful, the locations they went to shoot were stunning. It made the movie feel almost real. This was also one of the most ambitious movies Marvel has ever made. Marvel has a very strict policy on making their movies fairly kid friendly. That is why I was surprised when I saw a sex scene in the film. It only lasted a few seconds and showed no nudity, but I still didn't really like it. Marvel is known for being kid friendly, I don't want them to ruin that with things like this. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is going to be a more scary movie, I rather Marvel be less kid friendly in that way, not the way they did in this movie. They also weren't afraid to kill any of the heroes. Ajak (The leader) ended up being dead a few minutes into the movie. They also killed Gilgamesh, Ikarus, and let Sprite choose to lose her powers to actually live a life. They started with 10 Eternals, and ended with 6. I don't know if the characters will return, but they did die in this movie. Lastly, I loved the characters in this movie. I loved all of the Eternals, they were funny, they had cool powers, cool suits, and the chemistry between the actors was great. They all played their roles perfectly. That is why I can't chose just a few that I like. We can't overlook the legend of this movie, Karun. He is easily, without a doubt my favorite supporting character in the MCU. He was absolutely hilarious. If Marvel made a Karun movie or show, I would watch it, and I would love it.Sure, this movie was long, and at sometimes did get a little boring, but that doesn't overlook all the positives this movie had. It was a good Marvel movie and I am very much looking forward to seeing these characters again. If Marvel fans are hesitant about going to see this movie because of what the critics are saying, go see it, it was a good movie and I definitely recommend it. I really hope they do an Eternals sequel. They set it up pretty well at the end. Next up is Hawkeye! Can't wait!"
1735,8,"Interesting marvel Another thoroughly enjoyable superhero movie with superb special effects and action scenes, epic battles and world-threatening villains. The style and plot of the movie is different; it's a lot more mature and emotionally driven, focusing on the characters and the role of humanity on the planet, but still has a few lighter moments and it never felt long. Great acting from the varied cast, especially Chan as the lead, but I'm not sure how it will stand out as being memorable in the years to come."
1736,5,"A Snoozefest Ah. As short and to the point as possible.Felt like watching the entire LOTR trilogy in a 2.5 hour span.Like having an itch on your back you can't quite reach.Amazing potential. Good star power and powerful performances (for what it was). The final act was a breath of fresh air for those falling asleep in the theaters. Visually stunning, and one of the more important films moving the MCU forward for sure.Would have suited better as a trilogy film series or a D+ series. There was too much packed into one film to care about any of the characters. Jolie shines through though to be fair.Looking forward to all the branching stories from this film though.Lower tier Marvel film. One of the FEW mcu films with no rewatchability."
1737,2,"BORING! This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched. A great cast, but terrible movie. I'm not a marvel fan, went in with an open mind, and came out less of a marvel fan if that was even possible. Waste if time and money. I lost 2hrs 33mins of my life 😒"
1738,7,"Something new, had fun I had low expectations and was surprised by how different the movie was from what we are used to in the M universe. Obviously there were silly things in the movie that didn't make any sense but why expect otherwise - it's about superheroes in a made up world. Some cool easter eggs and overall a fun time out with nerdy friends."
1739,10,"Good movie Don't listen to negative reviews, it's actually a good movie, might not be among the best ones, but it's worth it. It's a different approach. It's beyond of our regular believes that why most of the people hates it."
1740,8,"Very good, of course I didn't understand why everybody trash talk this mobile so Bad. It's différent from last MCU movies, but different doesn't mean Bad. It's Closer than a justice League Snyde's cut, and i really Enjoy it. Arishem is so impressive."
1741,8,"Actually not too bad A short review here, i liked it. It felt fresh and new, kept me on my toes and has some really epic moments in it. Really good acting and effects if a bit bloated and badly paced with flashbacks. Dont get me wrong I totally get if people dont like it but i cannot understand the 2 and 3 / 10s."
1742,8,"Something different, but worth wotch! I like this movie a lot. Action scenes of this movie was really good. The way they created that storyline that they arrived on earth around 5000 BC. And their main work to save the earth from those creatures. I liked the power of all 10 superheroes. Some character I like the most but with some characters I wasn't connected well example that deaf superhero, her acting was decent but there should be any translator or anything like subtitles to understand that what she tried to say. There were very less action scenes but no doubt VFX was top class I like the way they introduced Indian culture. This movie's humour was also quite Decent. Only the length of the movie little bit long aside from this, movie is worth watch!"
1743,3,Nope This movie was not it. I would have preferred they rolled out eternals like they did captain America. Start with the past. The entire movie should have taken place 1000s of years ago. The. Maybe in the 2nd movie we could have moved to present time!
1744,4,"Marvel pulled a DC on us This movie has no place in theaters, it's a shame and disgrace to Marvel itself. It was always going to be tough topping the Avengers series but this was too big a dropoff. In a bid to be inclusive, Marvel made an abomination of a movie."
1745,7,"Okay Movie Honestly, I agree with this being the weakest entry of the MCU. When watching this film at times I got really bored but as it progressed I did thurraly enjoy this film. The ending was nice the cliff hanger was definitely something Angelina Jolie even though having a few words she was fantastic as always I thought that Cercie was really good and Karun always managed to make me laugh. Overall decent movie but definitely the weakest."
1746,10,"Finally something fresh - A story about humanity Yes its an MCU film but it doesn't feel like one. It's not about flashy action sequences or the conventional superhero good vs. Evil stories we've come to know and love - and that's why its so good!Eternals explores what it means to be human and the existential dilemma when they are faced with the choice of saving or destroying humanity.With a big ensemble cast you'd think it'd feel shallow since there wouldn't be enough screen time for all the characters... but Chloe does a good job making each character feel important and even when there isn't enough screen time for lines, the visuals says it all.Yes the pace is slower because it has to be to give each character the space to grow and figure things out. I love how the movie portrays a diverse set of characters disagreeing on certain values and still be... civil? Which is apparently hard to come by these days if you watch the news.Yes there will be Marvel fans who dislike this movie, but this is how you attract more people to the franchise - by diversifying how the stories are told.Please Marvel more of this!!"
1747,10,A different flavored MCU Wonderful Oscar-grade MCU in wrapping up year 2021. This and Dune is my favorite of 2021. Cant wait for its sequel soon. Dont care with the critics. Watch yourself and be amazed.
1748,8,"Pretty Great It's a different take on a Marvel movie, but it's entertaining to say the least. However, there's more plot there is than action. I wonder what the rest of the Eternals will have to bring onto the MCU."
1749,5,"Mediocre, not my type of mcu movie Love interest with each other, bland villains, time jump flashback. Not for me. Not the actors fault, script wasn't interesting. Trying hard to be its own standalone movie."
1750,5,"Eternals After all the reviews, this wasn't as bad as it was said to be! It's not the best marvel movie but it's definitely NOT the worst! The ending Was a bit too far but man it was great and I enjoyed going to watch it :)"
1751,2,"Not worth your time or money. This is not only the worst movie in the MCU; it's one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. ""Eternals"" is a frustrating, boring, and lifeless film that does not feel like it belongs in the MCU. It completely throws the power hierarchy of the MCU out the window and introduces SO many plot holes.All of the actors looked bored out of their minds, the story is bogged down with exposition and pseudo-intellectual nonsense, the score is forgettable, the humor falls flat on its face, it's just an ungodly mess.If you're looking to get caught up on the MCU, you can skip this one. It doesn't affect the current course of the MCU and the impact that it attempts to have make no sense.Alternatively, give your money and time to movies like ""The French Dispatch"", ""Last Night in Soho"", or ""King Richard"": films that don't have the luxury of being under a cinematic universe and actually had to put in some effort."
1752,5,"Why did I find this movie un appealing I like all kind of movies, from Romance to Action to Sci-Fy, fantasy ... all genra. Loved the Infinity war saga. Bu this ... was made by a directory that made a movie that got an oscar ? No .. the movie academy have to call it back. This movie was cut with so many cliché, from the ""Pinochio"" to lets explain it in ""flash back"". The unimaginative narrative is even written in the script itself. Yeah this was the first MCU movie that have a gay caracter with a gay kiss Yeah !! Aside from that it does not proved to be very novative. Did someone at Marvel look at the final cut to see if it still made sense ? Because the story line does not."
1753,7,"i need less drama and more ""i need to kill god"" energy I was expecting more... but it isn't a bad movie, don't let the rotten tomatoes influence you.The only thing really bad is ikaris and sersi relationship, what was that thing????? Druig and makkari had more chemistry in three scenes than they had in the entire movie.The humor was good, the cinematography is beautiful, i laughed at lot but i missed a bit of action and somethings didn't make sense at alli need less drama and more ""i need to kill god"" energy."
1754,3,"Has all the bad qualities of Marvel films with none of the redeeming qualities If this movie was released in a universe where this was the only Marvel film ever, it's probably a 6/10 movie. But this movie represents everything I've come to dislike about Marvel films. This film was unnecessarily long, pointlessly convoluted, and bombastic yet entirely unsubstantial. Some Marvel films are at least fun, this one wasn't.The CGI and cinematography are probably the most standout aspects of this film but everything else was painfully mediocre, even the way this film describes humanity is painfully mediocre, ""why yes humans wage war, kill, and torture, but they also live love laugh™"".The characters have no chemistry and certainly don't display and closeness to one another, they just bounce one liners off each other. Character development doesn't seem to happen organically, but rather just for the sake of creating and resolving conflict. What was the point of Thena getting Mahd Wy'ry except for it conveniently happen at inconvenient times. Lots of plotlines and questions just go unanswered. They're not really supposed to interfere with human society or politics or whatever and yet they clearly do?As an standalone film its not that bad, but within the context of everything that the MCU has become, both the good and the bad, this film represents only the bad aspects.Also what was the point of that sex scene on the beach in furthering the story? Like we know Sersi and Ikaris is in love. They should've at least made my 4DX seat rock in the scene."
1755,3,"Has all my complaints about Marvel movies with none of the redeeming aspects If this was released in a universe where this was the only Marvel film to have existed it would be a 6/10 movie, but this represents everything I've come to dislike about Marvel films - painfully mediocre, pointlessly convoluted, and bombastic yet entirely unsubstantial. Some Marvel films are fun at least, this one wasn't.The only redeeming quality about this movie was its cinematography and CGI. Everything else was forgettable. Even the way they described humanity was forgettable, ""yea they murder and kill and torture, but they also live, love, laugh™""As a standalone this movie wasn't even that bad, but god it left such a bad taste in my mouth in the context of the MCU.And why did they even have that brief sex scene on the beach between Ikaris and Sersi? Like we already know they're in love. They should've at least made my 4DX chair rock in that scene."
1756,1,"Bland, boring, unoriginal Basically your average MCU movie. Doesn't try anything new, and copies the exact same formula from all other movies before it. It doesn't help that the only thing I remember from this movie is that Superman rip off Ikari. Nonetheless wouldn't see this again, it's not like marvel will make better movies considering how much this movie alone made in the box office."
1757,7,"Alright plot; lots of diversity! The plot was alright; a little wishy washy, but alright. This movie did a great job on diversity tho. We have Hispanic characters, openly gay characters, a mute, and people of color, like; they did good. I am a little disappointed that they didn't talk about Sprite cause she gave BIG lesbian energy; but we always have character development 🤞🏻 Overall, I'm very very happy about all the representation in this film!"
1758,8,"Dont believe in the criticism It is a great Marvel movie, in a different tone we were so far used to.Lot of new characters to introduce in one movie, probably that is why some might say its slow or expected other from it.I was invested in the story from beginning till end credits and loved it!"
1759,10,Honestly like why are people caring about rotten tomatoes score for this. Can people form their own opinions?! This movie was awesome. Fight scenes are so great. The dialogue is spot on. Deviants look terrible in a good way. They supposed to be abominations. I liked the references to other stories they could do. There's a lot more praise to say but I just want say my piece.Ps: What I think people need to do is creat their own damn opinions not have someone else make it for them.
1760,6,"Meh As a Marvel film fan I wasn't looking forward to this. It was better than I was expecting, but that doesn't say much. An awful lot of plot holes that I won't go into as I wouldn't want to spoil the film for others.I went, just in case it would somehow be referenced in the upcoming Spiderman film. I find it hard to believe it will be."
1761,6,"Missed the mark Story is not good enough, very disjointed !! Unfortunately, Nothing special about this movie. I love this kind of movie, but left movie theater without remembering anything worth remembering. Especially after I watched Dune. Soundtrack is just Ok. Same old story."
1762,6,"I didn't hate it I mean, the expectations for this movie were pretty high but was it good enough to please them? I don't really know... from the trailer and the movie poster I assumed Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek were like the main leads, turns out they are not... the plot is very confusional, there's too much going on.I think this was just an introduction, maybe the sequel will be better, I look forward to it. After all the cast choices were good and there were some funny scenes that made me laugh, worth watching if you're a marvel universe fan but definitely not their best movie..."
1763,10,"The most inclusive and exciting MCU movie so far Finally the MCU started realizing not only white people (and white men especially) can be superheroes! Eternals has the first deaf superhero, who is a woman of color, the first Asian woman lead, the first officially gay superhero who is black, the first latina superhero and the first south Asian superhero! All of the actors did a magnificent job and their characters were actually well-written and not one-dimensional. Chloe Zhao is a brilliant director and I am forever gratefull to her for giving us Drukkari.The story is unlike anything we have seen before in the MCU and personally I find it quite refreshing to see superheroes other that Captain America and Iron Man. It was also really interesting to see the superheroes having completely different super powers than what we are used to see from the MCU. I'm here for all cosmic energy weapons! The visual effects were excellent and the costumes too. Definitely worth watching! I will watch it for a second time for sure! I loved it!"
1764,6,"Good, but not great... I feel like the movie primarily struggles to introduce the characters to us and give every of them time to let us know them, as there are to many for one movie. For example the scene where Ajak gets killed by deviants: it wasn't as "" sad"" or ""devastating"" as it could have been, because we didn't get to know her in an emotional level.Otherwise the cgi is fantastic, some of the actors are great, others not as great. To little action and the run time felt eternal for no reason, as the run time didn't establish nor added anything important.My review: 6/10."
1765,4,"About 2 hours too long Extremely slow and boring, I kept waiting for it to pick up and it never did. Good seeing Jon snow and Rob stark together again though. I definitely wouldn't waste my money going to see this at the cinema, wait for it to get on streaming at least then you can play a game of monopoly while you 'watch it'."
1766,9,"Best Marvel Movie of 2021 Watched Eternals with Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asians) as Sersei Richard Madden(1917) as Ikaris ,Kuamail Nanjiani(Men In Black International) as Kingo,Lia McHugh(Totem) as Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry(Atlanta,Godzilla Vs Kong) as Phastos alias Phil,Lauren Ridloff(The Walking Dead) as Makkari,Barry Keoghan(Dunkirk,The Green Knight) as Druig, Kit Harrington(Game Of Thrones) as Dane Whitman, Don Lee(Ashfall) as Gilgamesh, Angenlia Jolie(Salt,Maleficent:Mistress Of Evil) as Thena, Salma Hayek(The Hitmans Bodyguard) as Ajak, Bill Skarsgard(It) as Deviant Kro, Haaz Seiman(Covert Affairs) as Ben Stoss And David Kaye(Transformers Prime) as Arishem The Judge.The Film is great while the character is borderline thin its there but i feel is rushing to get the finale and it was slow at times but i really enjoyed the diversity of the eternals Phasto LGBTQIA+ which was made possible FinnPoe/Stormpilot which paved the way so Phastos and Ben can run , Thena and Gilgamesh Interracial relationship and Makkari the first deaf hero in MCU it was the best of the part of the film along with Arishem The Judge also somewhat Justifies Thanos actions but not really im honestly confused who is the main threat or Next Thanos Kang or Galactus since Sylvie Killed another Version Kang in the Loki TV series opening up the Mulitiverse which has been hinted strongly in 3 of 4 as well 2 of the Movies TV shows Wandavision,Loki,What If as well Shang- Chi and the Upcoming Spider-Man No Way Home idk if that will be resolved in Doctor Strange and The Multiverse Of Madness or Ant-Man and The Wasp:Quantumania and how the Young Avengers fits into this, I personally think this Best Marvel of 2021 also hoping the Diversity trickles down into The Star Wars IP even though they made strides already.Score By Ramin Djwadi(Iron Man), ,Cinematography by Ben Davis(Captain Marvel) and Direction by Chloe Zhao(Nomadland) Best Marvel Movie of 2021 9/10."
1767,5,"Not great by any means Maybe it's Marvel fatigue or just the fact they set the bar very high. This film just missed the mark. It was too long with too many characters that you did care about and it jumped around way too much. To make an ensemble film of this magnitude you have to have enough backstory on each of the players to actually care about them. That is an impossible task with one film. The reason the Avengers movies worked was because there were layers to each characters backstory. It took time to develop. However that is not why I thought the movie was below average.I am a big marvel fan and really wanted to like the movie. I did not know too much about the Eternal comic books but I knew enough to think this movie could have succeeded. The reason it did not succeed was because the story made no sense. It was too frantic and changed too much. Good guys were actually bad, the bad guy wasn't so bad. None of this made you care enough to over look the lack of passion that came from the actors. It all felt stiff and forced.As much as I enjoy Easter eggs ( Marvel does this so well) all the references in this film felt forced. Once again I didn't connect with the hero's and care about them at all. Even Angelina Jolies performance felt stiff and lacked energy. She is a fantastic actor too.I think that as a stand alone film it would still be too long, didn't make much sense but visually was satisfying. Considering it's part of the MCU it falls very flat. Maybe a film about one of the Eternals living in todays world could have worked and had more emotion to it. But overall this was too ambitious and did not work.I did think the Celestials were portrayed quite well . The Deviants did not make much sense. Felt like a bad Jurassic park attempt. I can't think of one thing that really stood out to me where I said wow. Go into to this movie with no expectations and maybe you will enjoy it more than I did."
1768,1,"Boring The longest, boring, woke, PC sermon I have ever watched.I am sorry I haven't left the cinema, like some people did, I won't get back my lost time.They mixed super heroes with Bollywood, with forced jokes and some fight scenes, again Bollywood jokes, and resulted a disgusting stew."
1769,1,Eternity! Must be the worst marvel film. Ever. It was unnecessarily long and dragged out and sooo boring. Fell asleep numerous times throughout. Can't believe I wasted 2.5hrs of my life.
1770,7,"Good and Mid movie at same time When i heard the reviews in the internet i thought this movie is going to be awful,but it wasn't. The pacing is a little fast but still a good movie,They tried something different and its not that bad,i didn't enjoyed that much as the other marvel movies but still,this movie opens the door for more villans to come and more movies."
1771,3,"Average I liked the visuals of the movie, even though there was something that made them look fake. The characters are...interesting. I couldn't tell Angelina Joulie was a celebrity. Salma Hayek's performance was ok, but not nearly as good as her performance in the hitman's (wife's) bodyguard. Since the audience is not emotionally attached to the characters, the stuff that they do feels irrelevant. I would've liked it better if the movie gave me reasons to relate/like the characters. The script was mediocre. 7/10."
1772,2,"I fell asleep in the cinema! As a massive Marvel movies fan, I was so excited to see yet another installment of Phase 4.I hated how the movie kept jumping to different years in time with very little set up prior to doing so. It worked in other Marvel movies but definitely not this one.There was too much dialogue. I felt they could've used that time to explore more of the character arcs.If you're going to make a 2.5 hour movie at least make it interesting, engaging & fast-paced.I was so bored, I actually fell asleep in the cinema at one point!The only reason for giving it 2 Stars is for actually including some Indian actors in it. For one of the largest populations in the world, there sure has been a lack of representation across previous Marvel movies & other Hollywood films in general.All in all it was slow, boring & lacked any oomph..."
1773,10,"Confused by the bad reviews. This was incredible, not just ok - incredible. I went in with an open mind that I might find it ok but different etc due to reviews and feedback from friends but this was a beautiful and incredible film!! Highly recommend! I absolutely loved it!"
1774,3,"All over the place, no likeable characters This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year.The story is so badly written that I never felt immersed.I dont know how this was even allowed to be released.Dont waste your time going to the cinema for this."
1775,9,"I don't understand the negative reviews This is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. I think it does well in terms of entertainment value and story-telling. Great chemistry between the cast & the diversity doesn't feel fake or forced. High on emotions and explosions. It's got all the makings of a good Marvel movie.Also, side note but- this is the most beautiful ensemble cast I've ever seen."
1776,9,"The internet ruined my expectations- yet I was still satisfied. I went into this movie, expecting it to be either mediocre or terrible (due to its Rotten Tomatoes rating and the internet in general), and yet, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of the movie.It's not perfect, but it's far from bad."
1777,4,"Incredibly Boring And Tedious Pros: 1. The fight scenes are entertaining, full of action and well choreographed.2. The special effects, as usual with Marvel films, are fantastic thus making sure the movie contains some semblance of realism.3. A few of the jokes land, mostly those that exist between Karun (Harish Patel) and Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani).4. Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel have the best chemistry out of anyone which helps to elevate their humour.5. The cinematography is great and produces some really stunning shots.Cons: 1. Salma Hayek (Ajak) delivers an incredibly stale performance.2. The run-time is way too long. There are a plethora of useless sub-plots that go nowhere and they should have been axed, like the Deviant sub-plot.3. The logic permeating the film is largely wayward. For some strange reason only advanced beings are needed for the Eternals' masters, but then the Eternals aren't allowed to intervene when humans kill each other off.4. There are way too many characters. This means that not only is there little-to-no character development, but it also means that characters like Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Kingo and Dane Whitman (Kit Harington) are given barely anything to do.5. Most of the humour falls flat on its face as it's inappropriately inserted and needlessly forced.6. There's way too much corny and regurgitated dialogue about how humans aren't perfect but they're worth saving.7. All of the romances are forced, they're laughably weak and are clearly there to pad out time.8. The transitions between the modern day and the past are far too jarring, and only seem included to dump exposition on the audience."
1778,7,"Mindblowingly different... I saw so many bad reviews thought this is a bad movie but wait a minute. Just watched this movie today. To be honest this is one of the best marvel movies I have ever watched. If you are going to expect the same marvel style and formula,please don't! This is a totally different movie. The chemistry between characters was very good.Well balanced and great story telling. This is a visual masterpiece if I say. Hats off to the VFX team. I saw some say it has a weak phasing and boring. I don't know if you have ever watched a movie other than a marvel movie."
1779,3,"Not good. Imdb mods, please stop removing reviews.Movie is super long, super slow. Out of 9 or 10 (can't remember) eternals only 3'ish have any background done. Rest are carton cutouts. At least half of them could literally be removed from the movie and you wouldn't even notice.Plot is slow and messy. Marvel tries to be as ethnically (and culturally) diverse as possible. We got just about every group there is, minus eskimo. All this pandering... just terrible.It's not even close to good as people say. The only good thing i can say about it is CGI. Especially celestials. Rest is just meh.Should you watch it? Nope. Waste of time."
1780,3,"Worst MCU film From start to finish this film, was a slow mess. Non stop time jumps that seemed unnecessary and confusing to the average viewers. Characters are the most uninteresting to enter the MCU. Acting from some of the actors seemed very bad and stiff. Hopefully the MCU gets it's act together after this film."
1781,7,"I was suprised that I enjoyed it. It was good! I enjoyed it. It was a good movie. Pacing had some problems yes, but action became good in the end. I liked the story. Only thing I did not like even if it was for a couple of seconds was Harry Styles. Post credit scenes were not good. CGI was good."
1782,6,"more of a 6.5 There were deffinatly some good things about this movie, some of the fights, and some of the character interaction weren't to bad either, a majority of the time though i just found myself bored."
1783,1,Can't get worse than that So disappointing that I lost interest completely and decide to have a nap halfway through the movie. Really enjoyed the nap in the cinemas reclining seats.
1784,5,"Its a boring movie 👎 Haha not that great. The movie could have been still better,first half of the movie feels so much boring..Shang Chi is far better than Eternals.And in terms of ratingsI would rate Eternals fr 5 out of 10 and Shang chi fr 8 out of 10. It's too boring to watch .🙃"
1785,8,"I don't know what the critics and haters are talking about... Pros: Cool story. Beautiful to look at. Some pretty cool action sequences. Kumail was hilarious as usual. And diversity in cast (yes, that's a huge plus!)Cons: the pseudo sex scene (yea, that was a mis-step) A few jokes fell flat. Slightly wooden acting from a few characters.Overall, one of the better Marvel movies I've seen. I would rank this right under Avengers infinity war and endgame. Although I haven't seen a few of the fan faves yet (eg ragnarok or black panther)I'm really looking forward to see where Marvel is going."
1786,1,"Disappointed Too cheesy, the weak heroes prevail despite their obvious impotence. It's disappointing. The movie is too rushed and I felt that I left home with nothing valuable after seeing this. I'd rather read fairy tales than watch this awful movie ever again and I was simply disgusted to see this after two years of not being to cinema anymore due to covid 19."
1787,3,"Murphy's Law Everything that can go wrong with a film basically went wrong with this movie. The action, story, dialogue, acting, editing...if it could be felt on screen it was going to go wrong. I was shocked when halfway through the movie i realized there was still another hour and a half to go. The movie drags and forces you to sit through some of the dullest dialogue and delivery. Plot holes and ridiculous reasonings make the movie incomprehensible at some stages. With action scenes that you don't care about because you can't really care about the characters. That's if you can see anything because so much of the scenes were shot like Kit and Richard brought the lighting crew from Game of Thrones.There are some fun jokes and visually stunning shots but these are few and far between. The only positive takeaways I could muster was the scope of the film was refreshing and the ideas were promising. But the execution was sorely lacking and felt hollow.Overall Eternals lacks in all the areas that counts and tries to make up for it in the diversity aspect of its casting. Representation will only carry you so far, and if your film lacks substance that's not going to be very far."
1788,6,"Ok It's ok, however Eternals is the second worst MCU film after Thor: The Dark World. It's plus sides are the cast and the diversity, it's downsides are the weak plot, unexplained events and how little we know about some characters but others have the sweet joy of screen time. Having ten characters on the poster but not using them all effectively or just focusing on two or three isn't what I'd expect from the MCU, but it's what I got! Wouldn't watch again. The best parts are the end credits scenes!"
1789,8,"As a DC fan, I highly approve! Just off the bat, I am a hardcore DC fan, love everything Zack Snyder and pretty much think the MCU is rubbish, so I generally felt this movie deserved for myself to write a review because it is actually phenomenal. No wonder is got a rotten score.The pacing is awesome, great dialogue and chemistry between characters and just enough action throughout the film that by the final act getting a real taste of the eternals capabilities throws you out of your chair.And thanks to both the films ending and the end credits scenes, for the first time im actually impatient to see what happens next.Seriously, if marvel keeps going with this type of film making they have just won themselves a new fan."
1790,3,"It Is sad when morons destroy your childhood comics While i went to see it as a guest, I was not specting too much. MCU just do what must other companies do, take a good history and destroy it with the whole stupidity of making the characters homosexual when they were not. Then goes and state that Is good for childrens under 15 another stupidity.You want to do a super Hero homo story, write your own, stop destroying originals super heros.Do recommend it, too slow path with too many plot holes and a lot of characters that was just fillers of space."
1791,3,"Caught a good nap Thats right. I dozed off for a good 15 minutes and I'm not sure what I missed because when I opened my eyes I was still up on what was going on. Now I know that people are defending bad reviews by saying that we are being homophobic or do not appreciate a hero with a disability. Nope! I didn't mind that at all. Sitting with my grandson while to male heros kissed didn't much bother me. I mean that's pretty well mainstream nowadays. Really the only issue I had with the deaf hero was the fact that my grandson can't read the subtitles fast enough to know what was going on and I wasn't going to bother other watchers reading it to him. The fact is the movie was just plain bad. I honestly thought I was watching a DC movie. Little to no character build up, a plot that was never really 100% understood and one of the most anti climactic endings I have seen since the Blair witch project. I wanted so badly to like it as I told my grandson that this is THE movie in Marvel's next phase and will set the foundation to future movies. I hope I am wrong there. I thought to myself afterwards that it was like if you never seen a marvel movie and started with the first avengers. Not only do I not know any character back stories, whose side they are on and the powers they possess. It just seemed like any of them can do anything. I know that's not true because one guy enjoyed shooting Lazer out his eyes like cyclops but another could do the same with what I think was his fingertips. I don't know, maybe Zach Snyder can jump in and do a ""justice league "" move on it. I hate so so much that I hated this movie. But I fear that Marvel may have jumped the shark with this one."
1792,8,"Understand some of the hate, but I feel it's gone too far Externals has some pretty glaring flaws that I think are hard to ignore, but I think what it does well easily out-ways all the bad. So I'll list some of the major problems with the movie that I agree with people on; there are too many new characters (12 including Dane Witman and Arishem), the main deviant ( Kro, whose name I literally had to look up) is unnecessary and isn't well fleshed out at all, and Gemma Chan's, Sersi, is severely underdeveloped and doesn't have much presence even though she is the leader of the group.So with that being said, do the positives really outweigh the negatives? I believe they do. Let's start with the strongest point of the movie for me. The reason the Eternals are sent to Earth is shrouded in mystery, even after the credits end. I think thats really appealing and allows for the characters to go through and identity crisis that all of them have unique reactions to. Ikaris's betrayal is a twist, but it doesn't surprise the audience when they see it, because of how he's portrayed and acts through out the movie. But he doesn't just flip an evil switch and turn into a laser beam shooting mustache twirler. Instead the movie shows us his hesitation to both his loyalty to Arishem and to Sersi, as he ultimately decides not to kill her and for the first time, disobey his orders. But because of his will to complete his task he has done some pretty terrible things, and when he ultimately goes against Arishem he has already been the cause of the death of two of his team members and the divide of the group. So now he's left in a world where he's failed at something he's committed murder for, and now has to look at his love and realize that he can't take back what he's done. It's a somber ending, and I wish it would've ended differently. It's heavily implied that ikaris flies into the sun killing himself to attone for what he's done, but it would've so much more interesting to have him fly away and just go somewhere out in space. Killing himself was a bit of a lazy way to write him out, and not deal with the repercussions of what his actions and failures would do to his character. I also feel like since they didn't actually show him dying, they could just pull the cop out in future movies, showing him not going through with it and doing something more similar to what I mentioned before.So I realized I still have a lot to say in the movie, but don't feel like writing a book. To summarize what I'm saying. Eternals has great concepts with good but not great execution. The concepts alone are interesting and thought provoking, and make you believe in the drama they cause. I feel that some people are looking at the surface of this movie and not any deeper, but everyone has a different viewing experience, and things they notice while watching the movie. So all I can say is give the movie a chance, and watch the nonverbal acting, and you'll see the great depth the movie is hiding. I think this movie is amazing and will be putting it in my top five MCU movies to date. Have a good one to whoever made it this far!"
1793,4,"What a Disaster. What a train wreck. Terrible pacing that made it a chore to get through, along with trying to be too many things at once with so many dull characters that I had no reason to care about and it's boring.Visual impressive and some okay scenes are the only good things it has going for it."
1794,10,AMAZING I am obsessed! It was amazing. The actors were amazing. The plot was amazing. Everything was amazing. There is a lot of diversity. I recommend you watching this with a friend because you're gonna want to talk about this. Go watch it!!!!
1795,6,LONG This film was soooo long! It just dragged on and on. The first half of the film I found very boring however it did get better with quite an exciting ending and 2 decent post credit scenes. The cgi was pretty dreadful and so was some of the acting.
1796,5,"I'm a Marvel Fan. But this movie was a disappointment The story is long and dragy.. with nothing real coming of it.. The movie could have been easily skipped, had I waited a week more to read the reviews... reading the plot online is enough and the movie doesn't do much other than introduce the Eternals characters.. The movie was draggy and lacked action (which I dint expect from Marvel Movies) marvel should not continue to go in this direction to make long boring movies.. it was a waste of time and highly disappointed.."
1797,6,"This movie was almost there The movie was not bad, the story was also compelling. The VFX looked great, especially the Celestial. The movie was very dark for some reason, it was hard to concentrate or be drawn into the story sometimes because of that lighting choice. Some of the characters made a lot of questionable choices, I am not sure what the writers were thinking. This made some characters not likeable at all. Also it must have been tough for the director to make choices in the cutting room because there were too many arcs and not all of them could be realised. I think if they give the same director a chance with the second one, she'll sort some of the issues out. All in All, it was not a bad movie, and it is indeed the worst in the MCU."
1798,6,"Nice Concept, but... Overly long, same-y fight scenes and a struggle to remain engaged until the final reel.Sequel seems very likely; let's hope the film makers iron out these wrinkles before Pt. 2."
1799,2,"Worst marvel movie If your looking for an enjoyable movie watch something else. Never have I gone to a Marvel movie before this and came out not caring about a single character. Villain was awful, plot was not interesting at all. Hope Spider-Man will be better than this."
1800,6,"A decent film let down by characters that don't really work I thought this was a novel film that was a bit different from most marvel films and, although a bit long, it was quite good.However having seen so many marvel films in the last few years I felt the characters were not up to the normal standards. I didn't really take to them and thought they were quite forgettable.If you like marvel its worth a watch but don't expect to be blown away."
1801,9,"Bold, stunning, and...surprising Over the years, some of my favorite movies have come out of left field, leaving me somewhat taken aback after a first viewing and requiring a little time for me to process what I just saw, because it was not what I expected (e.g. Brazil, Heathers, The Princess Bride, etc.). Very different movies, and very different from Eternals...but what they all have in common is that I couldn't stop thinking about them after the fact. I haven't had my second viewing of Eternals yet, but I'm very much looking forward to it because sometimes I think a lot of us get caught up in what we expected from an experience and it takes a little time to re-calibrate things in our minds before we can truly appreciate what we saw.Like most movies, Eternals certainly has its flaws, but overall this is a movie that dares to be different in a world that all too often rewards sameness. As an MCU movie, it is thrilling to know that the formula we've seen repeated for the last thirteen years (quite successfully, I will say, from Iron Man all the way through Shang-Chi) doesn't have to constrain the evolution of this franchise. Chloé Zhao has gifted us with a look at what the MCU can evolve into...something bold, grand, philosophical, and intellectually challenging, while never losing sight of the strong characters and complex relationships that make these stories so compelling.The world is a diverse and complex place, and Marvel has been gradually building up an impressive stable of characters that attempts to mirror the real world experiences of audiences (albeit rolled into a ramped up super power infused fantasy!). But while Black Panther went all in to provide a much needed and brilliant film that reflects the experience of the black community, numerous strong female heroes have been spot-lighted, and Shang-Chi immersed us in a world of Asian inspired characters and storytelling, until now, LGBTQ+ representation has been notably marginalized in these films (reduced to self-congratulatory cameos and offhand comments that were perhaps good intentions at progress, but ultimately fell flat). So it is exciting to see Marvel no longer keeping characters that represent some communities hidden in the shadows, while others get the spotlight. And bravo Disney for taking the surprising stand of not removing any material from this film to avoid being banned from intolerant markets...hopefully a sign that one of the most powerful companies in the world might use their influence to make the world a kinder and more inclusive place even if that means they lose a little profit.That said, I have been very alarmed at how during the movie's second week as #1 at the box office, every theater in my area is already starting to pull showings, reducing the Disney plan of a 45 day run in theaters to a mere 21 days (literally, there are no showings scheduled near me starting Thanksgiving day). Perhaps the turnout has been low due to the pandemic, but it still makes me wonder whether companies like Regal and AMC are working for or against inclusive representation in cinema.If I do have one complaint with Eternals, it would be that it did feel a little long and that perhaps there was more that could have been done to dig a little deeper into the relationships between the characters (mainly Thena and Gilgamesh, and Makkari and Druig). Granted, introducing ten new heroes in a story spanning thousands of years is a pretty tall order, even when you have over two and a half hours to tell the story, and I did walk away remember every character's name (unheard of!)...but that's what I wanted more of. What I got was great, but did leave me to fill in a few blanks on my own. If they were to announce a three hour+ director's cut, I would be SO excited to see how much of the story we were denied because of short attention spans and monetization of theater showings.SPOILER ALERT!!!Okay, I lied...I have a second complaint. And that is with the mid-credits scene, so if you haven't seen the film and don't want me to spoil it, stop reading now. To be honest, I have no strong feelings one way or the other about the character of Starfox for about Harry Styles. It was cool enough that the brother of Thanos showed up at the end. But the CGI of the character Pip was absolutely atrocious! In a movie that was so visually stunning, a sumptuous feast for the eyes, it was so jarring to see what amounted to rejected video game test footage dropped in at the end. We know you had the budget...so what gives???Another slightly spoilery note, but this time a good thing...a very good thing. I love how the film deals with faith and the oft times destructive and violent nature of blind faith. These characters all handle their faith so differently in terms of what they are willing to do to defend it, and the values that sometimes allow them to act counter to their beliefs. I could probably write a whole analysis of just this aspect of the film (contrasting Ikaris and Kingo, Sprite and Sersi, Phastos and Druig, etc.), but hopefully this movie will encourage people to analyze the many parallels we see in the world today and perhaps learn to interact with others more respectfully and constructively.BOTTOM LINE Eternals isn't the best of the MCU, but it is far from the worst. It is a beautifully shot, beautifully acted and intellectually challenging exploration of the dangers of blind faith. This is new territory for Marvel and I for one hope they have the courage to follow through in future films."
1802,2,"Boring and completely lacking substance The movie was far too long, far too boring, far too predictible and not what you should expect from an MCU movie. The fights are bad with random levels of being strong or useless for the heroes with senseless scenes and changes that amount to nothing in the story line. The inbetweens are just bad lines with bad writing and mixed levels of bad and good acting.The only thing this movie sends out is its numerous political statements but nothing in terms of storytelling, excitement or doing the characters justice."
1803,8,"Enjoyed the cinematic and character-driven MCU deepcut film I really enjoyed this movie and how it made the character's emotions the driving force for the movie. We get introduced to these characters and see their journey in a contemplative way.Some may find that slow, but I enjoyed the slower pace that allowed the audience to digest the enormous implications that the film sets-up.There are a lot of out-there comic book ideas for the cosmic side of the MCU that may be hard for some to accept, but I am all for it.Jack Kirby made something special and the Eternals are a welcome addition to the MCU for me."
1804,7,"Try to tell a lot in a short time One of Marvel's most ambitious films, from the cast to the direction and composer to the fact that it introduces us to a new dimension of the Marvel Universe. The heroes are no longer humans or demigods, they are now gods whose missions are from a higher plane than the human one.It is a film that seeks to explain and introduce a whole new universe while telling a story, which results in the film at times overwhelming the viewer with a huge amount of background information in a very short time as you try to understand the main story.Still, it's one of the best Marvel films of recent times, especially thanks to the cast and direction, and shows that Marvel knows how to make more serious films that work very well as superhero movies. Finally, the pacing at times is not smooth and it gets bogged down in a succession of facts that are only mentioned afterwards and it is assumed that the characters already know them.PS- the best scenes of a superhero in super speed that have ever been made, they give a real sense of speed.PS2- Criticism of the ""political agenda"" and other nonsense is ridiculous and unfounded."
1805,8,"Enjoyable Went to see this with my husband and 12yo. All 3 of us enjoyed it. This rating came from my 12yo, she felt parts of it felt a little long, but overall she thought it was a great film. My husband nodded off for about 5mins. It's not as light-hearted as other Marvel films are, but it was still worth watching at the cinema."
1806,1,"Marvel goes from 10 to 0 after eternals There is a different concept about eternals, humans and deviants in comic and there is a valid reason behind it. The concept shown in movie is a bit lose i think. Like they were present on earth and lived through battles hiding like cowards and suddenly want to become hero and started to discover there power in the end. They didn't interfere when battle was going on with thanos. I mean what if thanos decides to erase everything but eternals wait and watched everything and letting avengers do all the work. Seriously marvel need to rethink about this concept."
1807,5,Snooze A few people I went with fell asleep during this movie. The movie spent majority of the time on Cersei's story which just felt uninteresting at times. Even Thena's storyline was underwhelming and she was the main reason I went to see it. I thought the acting was great and they did their best with what they were given. There is a random sex scene thrown in that felt so out of place. I don't think it was terrible but I was certainly glad when it was over.
1808,4,"Very off the track For me the story isn't belivable, a lot of scenes makes no sense. The acting looked like it was played by a 10 year old, writing was the worst i have ever seen in any Marvel movie. It isn't even close to what Infinity Saga managed to build up. I hope the next movies will be better, otherwise its going to be as good as the DC movies."
1809,2,"Quite messy Not the usual MCU masterpiece.Too slow and boring in parts, seemed to take too long to get to the point.I don't understand the motivations of the main character she seemed a bit unemotional. Neither did I understand the motivations of the antagonist and why he did what he did in the last act. The deviant plot seemed unfulfilling.Too many characters, too much time trying to give a back story to all of them. Ends up giving tiny flashbacks which are still meaningless.The humour seemed misplaced and brought a conflicting tone to the movie at inappropriate points it seemed.There was some good action and twists.The ending was inconclusive. The whole movie felt off.There seemed too much diversity with no reason. Black Panther made sense because it is located in Africa. I don't understand why and how an Eternal can be gay and deaf. It would make more sense if they were all asexual."
1810,8,"Set up - Marvel brilliance Great movie if your a marvel fan.As for the so called negative critic reviews they must not like or enjoy marvel movies.Eternals is Very deep in marvel history origins right up to setting up phase 4 even phase 5 of the marvel cinematic universe.It's very balanced humour, action, relationship and interesting story line.Adding the effects makes this a pretty cool visual.There's always parts to improve on but for me I left very satisfied and will see it again.Must see...."
1811,5,"Around the world in under three hours. This is the first MCU movie that I've seen in the cinema that actively bored me. You know you're in trouble when the film starts with a written prologue - like Star Wars.There are a lot of firsts with this film along with the prologue: First gay superhero, first deaf superhero and first sex scene in a marvel film. Yet for all of its inclusivity points, all of its beauty and gold (lost and lots of gold) the script absolutely sucked.The incessant globe trotting and flashbacks didn't help either. The first time I saw the trailer, I thought: there are too many characters. Not only are there too many super heroes for one movie, but way too much exposition with the celestials and the Eternals's purpose.I don't understand why this couldn't have been a TV series , as there are so many on Disney+ right now and this could have been the perfect new entry and it would have benefited way more."
1812,1,"Not recommend Not recommend at all!!!Bad sroty, dont like it at all.Big names wasted and wasting of time, please do not go see it!!👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻👎🏻 👎🏻 👎🏻"
1813,3,"Weak This whole film was a big piece of mediocrity with a splash of horrible writing from Oscar winning director Zhao.-Production, cinematography was top notch as always coming from Marvel.-The music score failed to connect with the audience in so many ways. Bad choices.-Salma Hayek is by far the worst actor 😆along with Gilgamesh, Don Lee.-One of the biggest problems with the script was the lack of a concerning antagonist. When presented, it absolutely lead to a dead end. No where in the film did i feel the ""eternals"" were ever in trouble. On the flip side these ""eternals"" didnt feel strong at all...mediocre. Zhaos attempt to bring a human connection to a super hero film was a hopeful but missed the mark. Wait for the stream...free one that is."
1814,5,"Seriously, why is this even a movie and not a Disney+ series? ""Epic ... scenic ... grand in scope"" : sure. ""not like any other Marvel film ... different"" : true, but I don't care as long as it has a strong core (characters, story). ""diversity ... gender bending ... first love scene in MCU ... first openly gay character in MCU"" : congrats, but more of a marketing thing than anything core to the actual story. ""Oscar winning director who happened to be on the Chinese blacklist ... her sensibilities do not fit the MCU model"" ... perhaps, but it seems the issue is deeper than just the stylistic choices of a single individual. In search of the problem, a close contender is the script, but perhaps even more central is the original decision to make this for the big screen.Trying to introduce 10 brand new characters within the constraints of a theatrical film seems ... unwise ... in stark contrast to The Avengers (2012), which had 5 films to build on. Even with the flaws in the DCEU approach, the general public had a vague sense of unintroduced characters in Justice League ... Flash (runs fast), Aquaman (talks to fish, right?). With the Eternals, the general public likely has nothing to work with. Times ten.As a consequence, we only get snippets of each Eternal, which in turn means I feel no emotional investment in any of them. Sprite's internal struggle is conveyed through a short bar pickup scene + a Tinkerbell mention. Thena's PTSD is a side story. Kumail Nanjiani's character had an interesting backstory (although it's probably a bad sign that Kumail's name comes to mind quicker than the character name). Layer on top of that their allegiances don't make sense. By their character arcs, I would have expected Kumail (who most integrated into human society) to have been team human, Druig (who has an obvious disdain towards human nature) to have been team Eternal, family Phastos makes sense, but atomic Phastos could have easily team Eternal. If not for the reveal that Eternals are all robots, I would have unironically said that the Ikaris character is a robot (an absurdly one dimensional one at that). I guess his team Eternal logic is because he's the loyal soldier (Cap pre capsicle?). Makkari (who is completely withdrawn, and if I recall her first reaction was ""is it time to go?"") could have easily been team Eternal. These character arcs just don't make sense ... or at least based on the abridged backstories we've been given.To do this justice, this should have been a 12 episode Disney+ thing. Each character gets a dedicated episode, culminating in a 2 part team up. Or reduce the character count to 5. Or anything but this movie."
1815,8,"Surprisingly good Marvel movie with some depth A change of pace that might not be for everyone, this movie is definitely more of a slow burn, that takes its time to create a movie that asks some deeper questions than your typical Thor movie. Nicely directed and acted, it's well worth your time to watch. I want to see more."
1816,4,"MCU is making a huge mistake here... First, the Eternals is visually appeasing, funny at times, exciting at others, and tells a complex story. Yeah, and I sorta hated it.Why? Well, let me begin by saying that the first phases on the MCU were extremely effective. The finale, the battle with Thanos, was emotionally draining and satisfying because you honestly felt like you'd just completed a long, and tenuous journey with Iron Man, and Capt America and Thor and Dr. Strange, and everyone else. That feeling of fatigue; that emotional exhaustion, those are human traits. HUMAN. It's those human connections that drew us all into the MCU and made us kinda sorta relate to the original Avengers.With the exception of Thor (to an extent, get to that in a minute), the original heroes of the MCU were HUMAN. We could relate to them, which facilitated our bonding with them. Tony Stark was a smart, money loving playboy. Captain America was a devoted patriot and World War 2 vet. Black Widow was a hot female that could kick ass. Hawkeye was a family man. Falcon and War Machine were military veterans. Black Panther was an African prince. Scarlet Webb was a frightened, orphaned immigrant. Dr. Strange was a miserable alcoholic. The Hulk was an egghead, clumsy scientist. Spiderman was a New York teenager. Captain Marvel was a blond fighter pilot. Even Thor looked and behaved more like a regular guy than a God. The Avengers were you and I, regular people thrown into a chaotic and epic adventure. We grew with them, we cried with them. We fought, we lost, and we won with them. But we did all this knowing that they, like us, were vulnerable, anxious, afraid. We, like they, had anxieties and hardships. And triumphs. So when Thanos came along, he represented an oddity to our world. A true alien, stronger than us, a challenge, a test of our talents, our bravery, our vulnerability, our skills, everything we'd become over the years. And even then struggle and death, we prevailed.But this new phase of MCU doesn't allow for this human connection. Remember how awkward it was when Iron Man was learning how to fly, and how great it felt when he finally nailed it. Now, everyone in the MCU is either flying around like Superman on meth, or shooting raybeams and fireballs from their hands, or doing weird, godlike things. It doesn't seem organic, or home grown. It's not real anymore.Nobody is HUMAN.And I think that is where this new phase of MCU is going to struggle. The Eternals may look human, but they are not. They die, but not like us. They weren't even born. They didn't have to be secretly trained for several years, or pumped full of super serum, or enhanced, built in a multi million dollar lab. They just came out like they were. And because of that, there's really nothing that is relatable with them. And if we can't relate to them, we won't invest in them. Not like we did with Iron Man, or Spiderman. Or Captain America. Can you honestly say that you didn't tear up at least a little in either Infinity War of Endgame?Forgive my rant, but the Eternals represents everything that I don't want for my MCU. I want homegrown. I want characters I can relate to. I want to know that my heroes can actually bleed.Instead, I got a very expensive CGI video game, full of video game characters. Disappointing. Off soapbox now."
1817,8,"Pretty cool I don't know why people think this movie is boring, and makes them disappointed, this movie is overhated. For me, Eternals is one of the best movies in 2021. My family also enjoy this movie, the characters have different attitudes and points of view. The cgi, sound effect, and the backsound are amazing. This movie deserves at least a 7.5/10 rating."
1818,8,"Why the hate ? I am a casual Marvel fan, catching their blockbuster superhero movies more often than not, but honestly forgetting everything after the movie. Despite loving the idea of a superhero team ensemble movie, I was never a huge fan of the Avengers movies because the power differentials between Thor - a literal god - and Scarlett Johannsen's piddly handguns was just too laughable. Here, we have the first real superhero ensemble movie. Each superhero in the Eternals has a different power and they all feel pretty matched in powers. It's diverse and wonderful and I thought the fight scenes here were way more interesting than any Marvel fare from before. I'm not sure why this movie is getting so much hate. I thought it was executed pretty well."
1819,2,"Not As I expected but hugely Disappointed Hmmmm where to Start!!Well ok I get it but Seriously there's so much I did not like that it actually Outweighed what I did actually like (and that was Minimal at Best) Sooooo Slow and Nothing we have not seen a thousand times in the MCU,The Boys or indeed the DC universe.Saturation and overlapping has finally happened Or the MCU has eventually exhausted its Arsenal.Overall this was Boring with a chronically bad and Drawn out story line.The Main Problem is even the Original Avengers or even The Justice League would make Mince Meat of any of these So called Super heroes."
1820,3,"waste of 2.5 hours The worst marvel film i have ever seen. Best part is angelina jolie who is the only one who isn't an appalling actor. Everyone is wooden, zero chemistry, plot is just terrible! Cannot believe i sat through the whole thing. Atleast my ice cream in the cinema was nice."
1821,3,"Not much going on here folks There's too much going on in this film, and too many forced story elements that don't add anything.Performances are all over the board. CGI set pieces are not handled well and the pace is very slow.A big part of the problem is that the Eternals were never a hugely successful title in comics. Very niche. This required a lot of exposition, not just because they aren't mainstream, but because there are so many characters in this film. It bogs down the movie.Fanboys and Fangirls who enjoy films like Fast and Furious, Transformers and the like will probably give this high marks. That is their right.However, professional reviewers and connoisseurs of sci fi/comic treatments will give this a solid C or C-.On to the next MCU film...Spider-Man No Way Home, which will hopefully be as entertaining as the first two Tom Holland spidey flicks."
1822,8,Not so great for a marvel movie but okay on it's own Okay so I'll say that I did like the movie it moved fast but the thing is I can really not understand what's so great about it this is not a horrible movie but however it's not the best I can see why some love it but I personally don't think it's one of the best.
1823,1,"Not a family affair Unfortunately not a movie you can safely take your family to. Too bad as Marvel has put forward a lot of clean movies too date.When you can put together movies like Captain America, Captain Marvel, and Black Panther without needing to add Explicitly Sexual content it's a shame that you have to change your winning formula."
1824,1,"Dull movie from marvel The acting is the dullest in the entire MCU. All of the actors felt like they brought no personality or chemistry to the table whatsoever and none of their performances felt memorable; it's even worse than Brie Larson in Captain Marvel. I don't know if they were miscast, were give bad direction, were given a terrible script or all of the above but fact still remains that they were completely unnmemmorable and wasted in this film. The only ones that felt like they were at least trying were Barry Keoghan, Bryan Tyree Henry, Kit Harrington (who isn't even in the film that much), Richard Madden, Lauren Ridloff and even Bill Skarsgard (who voices Kro); these actors felt like they had emotions apart from dull surprise.The pacing is also different from the other MCU films as it's much slower and more contemplative. Unfortunately, that also harms the film unintentionally as nothing much happens in both action scenes and quieter moments. Scenes also feel like they're just stitched together with no connection to the next scene tying them together, making for some pretty bad editing."
1825,5,"A slow experience. Eternal spends a lot of time trying to develop a bunch of uninteresting characters that nobody cares about. And at the same time this happens, the main story (which is already pretty weak) gets longer and longer along with the classic attempts to connect this movie with the whole MCU matrix, making the long experience more and more boring. The Makkari scenes are the coolest in the film as they are the only fast-paced thing happening in this slow paced narrative."
1826,3,Very bad plot Unfortunately the movie did not upgrade to Marvel movies' level. No story and no actual plot. It is like gluing things together to come up with something. Upsetting and waste of time and money!
1827,9,YES! YES! YES! I don't get why people are hating on it. It was visually stunning and they gave us something new never seen in the MCU which i loved. Chloe Zao did a good job in my opinion trying to capture everything in the comics with all these characters.Hope a sequel is in discussion right now.
1828,8,"it's worth the watch Honestly, I don't know what the critics are on about, the Eternals are nowhere perfect, the characters have pretty bland abilities. And personalities but the bashing is in undeserved. What spoils it, are the faceless, messy CGi deviants, which I pretty much dislike because they're pretty boring to look at, visually.All in all, the movie has soul, and has it moments. Definately not as bad as the critics and Woke haters make it out to be. Personally, I enjoyed it."
1829,10,"Not the usual This wasn't the usual brain dead action movie marvel is now synonymous with. This was a film with story, character growth, feelings and basic humanity at its depth. As someone who's grown tired of the marvel films now I loved it."
1830,8,"Is it perfect... no. Is it perfect. In a word, no. However it is beautifully shot, the story is engaging (albeit a little hard to follow with the amount it jumps around, but not without its merits). It's definitely not as bad as some people say it is.I thoroughly enjoyed how relaxed and ""real"" it felt, whilst feeling totally out of this world and fantastical."
1831,2,"A TOTAL MESS A total mess.Neither Marvel's sensibility nor the director's personality were felt. I know it's difficult to introduce many characters at once, but I don't think this is the best.Unlike existing Marvel movies, it seems to be compared to DC movies due to the directing style of characters and directors with ""supernatural"" abilities, but it does not seem to be as contemplative as DC.The depth of the characters' agony, trauma, and philosophical questions feels shallow and does not convey smoothly.In addition, the limits of the characteristics and abilities of the characters are not properly set, so I can't attach my mind to any character.Also, except for Angelina Jolie, most of them are not famous actors, and I think Angelina Jolie should be at the center.However, that part was not seen in Jolie's role.It's not a matter of Jolie's acting, but it's not easy to balance because it's made of characters that are mentally distracting in the first place, and in addition, it seems that the director has never made such various characters' chemistry before.The chemistry with the character Ma Dong-seok is also quite unfortunate.The relationship between the two seems very important, but I was surprised that they were treated too shallowly.I think I can make more use of the humor in the middle, but it was a pity that I couldn't.It seems to be divided into an audience who is quite disappointed in the movie and an introduction to a new Marvel Hero movie, but I'm close to the former.It's not just because it's different from the fun existing Marvel movies, but the movie itself felt clumsy.Perhaps the director's ability was inappropriate to deal with narratives and movies of this scale. If the movie had not been labeled Marvel, it would have been criticized more."
1832,9,Went with low expectations... And had a really good time.The movie gives you more than enough to get emotionally attached to the main characters and fights are all justified and not just for the show.I love that the background story is way more interesting than I was expecting .The only error for this movie was really the trailer making the movie looking flat and with zero depth. That's absolutely not the case.
1833,7,So he was a goed guy? Nice movie but no more the that.My storyline thoughts:So Thanos killed half the population of the universe with the snap of his fingers. This way delaying the emerging of the celestials all over the universe with de few years. So the eternals had more time to consider an alternate strategy.For earth the avengers messed this up.So Thanos was the goed guy. The avengers could not see the big picture. Making them the idiots. And earth was lucky with there eternals.
1834,1,"Terrible! I've never written a review before but this time I just had to so this will be the first! My wife and I left the movie early and I've never done that ever! It was SLOW, BORING, CORNY and the action had no depth or realism, just a bunch of big monsters getting shot or punched by a yellow light and them scurrying away and reappearing 20 mins later. Marvel you have really dropped the ball this time! With such a talented cast how did they accept such a terrible script! This movie was totally robbery of people's hard earned money."
1835,10,"8/10 but it deserves the boost Great introduction to the ideas of the Celestials. Brought down by having to do a lot, but the moments that work worked really well. Excited to see these characters get fleshed out more."
1836,8,"Great movie; baffled by the negative press This was a great movie. Not the MCU's best, but worlds better than Black Widow or Shang Chi. For a movie about eternal beings who have refrained from interfering in world affairs for seven thousand years, I thought the movie's pacing, action, and character development were spot on. This was never going to be Iron Man, guys.The only explanation I can find for the negative reviews it has gotten are that I've noticed the ""fans"" who talk negatively about Eternals, also had unexplainably negative reactions to Captain Marvel. Hmm... a film about a strong woman, and another film with the most diverse cast to date, including a bunch of strong women and a gay guy. Coincidence? Who's to say."
1837,6,"Beginning to lose interest As much as I like the MCU, they're beginning to feel a bit flat for me and this movie proves it. It feels like a different type of movie that isn't Marvel which makes it interesting. But since this is a Marvel movie, they used old tropes and clichés we've seen dozens of times in the MCU which gets annoying. Visually, the movie looks good and the style is magnificent. What I do enjoy is that it is getting ready for something big in future movies, but the movie as a whole was slow and sometimes some parts that were questioning for interested becomes something not all that exciting."
1838,8,Very nice! Somewhat different but good. Nice photography. Hype for this phase. A lot of people told that was bad but I liked this a 1000 more than captain marvel or Thor dark world and those were the weak ones in my opinion...this one stands pretty well in the superhero marvel movie cinematography.
1839,9,"Spectacular Visuals and a Story spanning 7000 years I loved the story spanning 7000 years, beautifully shot, and the most diverse cast in a Marvel film to date. I think Angelina Jolie, Lauren Ridloff and Kumail Nanjiani acting is amazing."
1840,8,"Stop whining Is it the best MCU movie? No.But is it somewhere in the middle? Yes I don't get all the complaining. Great cast and acting, and what it has set up is awesome. If you found it boring then that's on you. It was still very entertaining and fun. That's what I'm looking for when I go to the movies. If you were expecting End Game, then your a moron."
1841,8,Enjoyed this marvel movie that's seperate from marvel atm Saw at the cinema. Long movie that went quickly. Great charectors that need more fleshing out in the sequal. Good solid performances and great take on Old mythology with aliens shaping earth's history ect. Good CGI effects.
1842,3,"Don't waste your time! One of the most boring and long drawn out films with terrible acting I've ever seen. The only stars they're getting is for being inclusive, making me laugh about 3 times, and the fact that Angelina was the only decent actor."
1843,9,"Have we watched the same movie? I was a bit sad when reading negative reviews about the movie, therefore I have decided not to see it in cinema. But yesterday I had the opportunity to go, and I did. Luckily, I tried to keep an open mind and I left the cinema completely amazed and excited. The plot itself was, at least for me, mind-blowing. With the story about Celestrials and eternals. (I have never read the comic books, so I really had no idea what to expect). When it comes to cinematography it was eye candy, with beautiful colours and shots.This movie gave me a different vibe than the other Marvel movies. It was more serious, and the shots were slower than they usually are. But that is not a bad thing! Marvel studios is evolving and trying new things and I am glad that they are. We are already in phase 4 it is about time to mix it up a little.I am happy that I gave this movie a chance, despite all negative reviews. And you should too! For me it is easily in top 5 of all Marvel movies!"
1844,1,Boring and again forced ideas This movie feels forced and the ideas make absolutely no sense. Not spoiling but wow I bad movie and a waste of time. I think the MCU is over Deadpool your are only hope.
1845,8,"Eternals is not that bad, but... 'Eternals' is actually kinda good. I expect this movie to be slow paced because of course Chloe Zhao direct this movie. I thought I would hate all the characters, but I actually enjoyed their chemistry (even though I still have grudges against few of the characters). It's really nice to see them interacting as a payment for not having too much going on in this movie (action wise). And hey, the CGI is pretty good tooAnd about the plot... yeah, I think it's kinda messy and that's probably the reason this movie feels boring at some parts. There are some scenes that could've been cut to make it more ""to the point"", some scenes feel draggy. And that's the only thing I wish the movie could've improve."
1846,5,Almost decided to move out of cinema The thing is characters are really Powerful in movie but direction is not good marvel should have gone for male directors rather than female storyline is fine but not of that level compared to earlier movies.
1847,7,"Definitely Not The Weakest MCU Film! Still I believe captain marvel, thor the dark world and spiderman 3 are the weakest side rather than this beautiful yet satisfying tale cause it answers many questions.. Still this film is very weak at storyline and character buildup.. But chloe zhao did fabulous job at direction and cinematography.Overall this film is different art at superhero genre and at hatke category in MCU film list!"
1848,1,"The Worst Marvel Movie Ever Made It is not a good idea to read any reviews before watching the film, however, it seems that only a deaf person has not heard that Eternals did not like either the critics or the audience. What we have so far: the Oscar winner Chloe Zhao was set as the Director to make a new Marvel's installment so maybe that's would be nothing strange in her techniques, if it was something different from superheroes movies, because shooting a potential superheroes blockbuster and making auteur films are completely different things. This time, it did not work to cross two genres, which simply could not please either the Marvel audience who wanted to have fun, or the Zhao audience who wanted to think.The Eternals bring up a topic that has been dealt with rather closely in the last two Avengers, only there is a serious flaw in the current film's approach to this issue. No matter how barbaric the methods of Thanos were, there was something to think about in The Avengers. Eternals do not touch upon the issues of overpopulation or anything else realistic, for some reason everything in the movie presented as a given, and this requirement stumbles over the usual logic: cruelty and violence do not and cannot lie at the top of everything , which means that what the conventional antihero of the Eternals demands is absolutely false.In addition Eternals are over saturated with different ideas and thoughts. Here is the idea of the common good without war, based on deprivation of will. And here is the instant realization: the lack of free will leads to a halt in evolution. Here is an obvious thought about the nature of humanity, but immediately forgotten. The topic of man and humanity has not been revealed in any way, although in the case of immortal aliens it suggests itself. Here, in the words of some heroes, there is a hint of reasoning about evolution, and, moreover, in relation not only to people, as if it had never happened. There are a lot of such things in Eternals Chloe Zhao obviously wanted to talk about a million topics, but even the large chronometers did not allow her to do it with dignity.The story itself is very careless with their heroes: although, in fact, the creators approached the formal characteristics of the team thoroughly and chose representatives of all races, cultures and physical characteristics, the heroes themselves didn't become heroes, remaining only hints at them. Each of the heroes has lived a long life - seven thousand years - however, in the film, no one has any convincing background, as if there were no eternal ones at all. We don't know how they lived before, we do not know how and how they live now - thank you if someone has at least a hint of a profession or a family. Numerous excursions into history don't help in any way to understand and learn their history, which does not have a logical conclusion. The Eternals are trying to reveal a whole bunch of heroes at a time, which, as in the case of the theatrical Justice League, is not particularly successful.The plot is Eternally chaotic, inconsistent and in addition boring and lack of details. This film could be safely cut into three parts: there are several episodes in the picture, perfect for a couple of spectacular endings. If Eternals were a trilogy, the tragic scenes would have been perceived accordingly, and the culmination would have been more intense. Eternals are thrown not only from thought to thought, but also in time: here and a million years BC, and Babylon, and much more. However, these throws don't serve the plot: they are needed only for the next action scenes. Maybe it would have looked better, like a quiet philosophical fantasy, and there was no need to torment the director with scenes unusual for her for the amusement of the audience. Speaking of battles, it is perplexing that the Eternals are shown individually so vulnerable. This is strange, because in their 7 thousand years they were stronger than everyone else, but suddenly not.Some people will appreciate a new appearance of Lauren Ridloff from The Walking Dead as Makkari, but it's not helped the movie a lot as the appearance of such a famous persons like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and everyone's pretty annoying characters from Game of Thrones. Also note the dubiousness of such a hero like Ikaris who looks like a mocking parody of combination of DC Superman and The Boys Homelander.Following the new rules of Hollywood, Marvel is trying to add a new topic - making one of the eternal the first open gay character in the MCU. However, looks like the audience didn't particularly appreciate such a novelty. The involvement of the character and his nature seems like was gotten from some amateur LGBT film, for festivals specializing and not directly from an expensive blockbuster of a large studio. The filmmakers will blame one-star reviews for unwillingness to embrace LGBT society, but not bad plot, poor script, and directorial work.I wouldn't say that Chloe Zhao is bad director, but this particular just film showed us that the great talent of some director is throw away millions into garbage as the film itself is an experimental attempt by Disney to do something new on an old foundation. The movie tries to exploit the most popular themes in modern popular culture, but it does it so clumsily and uncertainly that towards the end it begins to look like a bad parody of superhero films, and not like a multimillion-dollar blockbuster by one of the leading studios on the market. Who knows, maybe it would work as a trilogy or even better a Disney Plus TV series, but not this mediocre trash, where everything is stuck together with cuts from different plots in such a way that the reasons of the narrative and the motives of the characters were lost before the viewer had time to understand and follow the storyline."
1849,5,"Meh... it really is kind of boring Yawned several times during the show and multiple people left early. Just a really plodding experience.Read the original comics but it had been so long I wasn't tied to any of the characters in any special way.But mixed with the plodding experience is a near constant shift between the past and present, which has been used to interesting effect elsewhere. But here it just disorients until the end.As a summary there isn't really anything that fails spectacularly, but there's also nothing that's really any good either. So it's just one of those things you sit through. Based on the look of her other movies, Chloé Zhao seems to have a way of handling projects which seems to work for some stuff. (At least based on awards and whatnot.) It didn't work here.Since IMDB numbers seem to rate ""saw it, it was interesting"" as a 6, and anything with at least something special above that a 7+, this gets a 5. Some may find something there, I didn't. (For me, 4 or below means I actively found the media adverse.)"
1850,10,"eternals The cinematography and choreography are so cool, I'm confused by the critics who brand the eternals of the movie bad. They should be proud that Marvel dared to get out of their safe zone. The message for Kevin's film Eternals 2 must be made. The film must continue its post credits to search for other eternals kidnapped by Arhisem."
1851,4,"More forgettable than eternal Eternals gets it wrong on many levels. It brings a great cast, nicely done visuals and exciting action sequences to cover its numerous plot holes. Unfortunately, it is a bandaid on a shotgun hole of a script.If Eternals were a song, I'd say it has all of my favorite instruments played by all of my favorite artists, poorly equalized, shoddily mixed, and the resulting sound is a muddled confusing mess of melodies that leave me scratching my head as to how all of these great elements could result in such a lackluster final product.Like many of you, I wanted to love this movie. What's not to love? But after the credits (and the post credits), I found myself more frustrated and disappointed than I thought possible, given the talent involved. But, before I talk about my objections, allow me to issue some praise.The cast were good at their job. The actors delivered in many scenes with believable chemistry, emotion and humor. The directing didn't allow them a lot of personality, but they still provided enough feeling to sell some of the key scenes.The visuals were fun, if a bit Doctor Strange-esque and unoriginal. The CGI was solid. The atmosphere and cinematography was really good. The sets were elaborate and visually delightful in some cases.But I'm not rating this low because of what I loved. Let's talk about the problems.The plot. The plot, which was straightforward enough in theory (Celestials farm beings on planets to birth new celestials using Eternals, who fall in love with humans and decide to prevent their destruction and fight back against their makers) turns out to be increasingly convoluted and philosophical as the film trudges on, with so much left unexplained, despite the long run time. A few extremely confusing examples:Why do celestials create Eternals with fake memories and deceive them about the process then wipe their memories after each planet? Why not just create Eternals who know the truth and do their jobs correctly?Why do celestials need sentient beings to be birthed at all? When the celestial is being born at the end, the humans aren't killed, he just emerges from the planet itself. It doesn't appear his emergence required sentient life in any way, just a planet.If celestials can just swipe up Eternals from a planet when they disobey commands, why not just swipe up deviants as well when they go rogue?Do deviants multiply? Do Eternals? They seem to have sex, but can they have kids? If they don't multiply naturally, why would they be programmed to have sex and fall in love?Why are Eternals programmed with various human dialects, traits and even disabilities that won't develop in the human race for millions of years? I mean, do they really need Scottish accents, need to look like undeveloped adolescents? What are the advantages to that?And then let's talk about the philosophical questions brought up, but not addressed well, of which there are many.The movie very specifically brings up major philosophical issues, such as the problem of evil, the trolly problem (how many lives is one life worth), the nature of free will, the meaning of life, consequentialism, mora subjectivity...the list goes on and on. The problem is, the director doesn't know what to say about these issues, and seems to repeatedly contradict herself or question herself in her own endeavor to bring the story to a close. Is God bad? Yes...uh...maybe? Is it right to save earth? Perhaps, but maybe only from a low level humanistic view? Is it right to follow your heart? Yes...Er...unless it turns out wrong? What's the best course of action for an unredeemable character? Suicide...apparently.We should be proud to be who we are, no matter who we are, so long as we aren't too loyal to our deity, so in love that we make poor choices, so devoted to our worldview that we refuse to be involved, so committed to non-violence that we don't go to war when needed, so compassionate that we lie to protect...omgI can't with this crazy, non-committal mess of a script, forcing you to second-guess your second guessing and wrapping up plot lines so hastily as to not even bother explaining them.Sentient deviant? Nevermind. He just dies in the end.Sprite loves Ikarus? He commits suicide and she barely expresses remorse.Special Eternal dagger given to a kid in the opening scene? Turns up later and seems like an important artifact, but you'll forget about that until after the credits, then wonder why.Emerald tablet? I don't know. Why was that important?Thena's disease? Still there, but it's real memories. I guess she's safe to wield her blade around children by the closing scenes.The boyfriend? Yeah, no. They won't explain him.There must be deleted scenes explaining these things, but the movie doesn't care. It doesn't know what it wants to say or who was doing the right thing, but earth is saved. For now.Ugh. I haven't been this frustrated at a hero movie since The New Mutants, which was an absolute train wreck, but whereas that movie was a paper thin plot with cliche writing, this movie is a bloated behemoth of a plot which refuses to commit to its source material or deliver on its moral and ethical questions.It's too morally shy. It's too philosophically unsure of itself. All it knows is that it's family focused and we should stick together. Unless you make a mistake. Then suicide might be a good option. Just don't trust the omniscient, all powerful God. Better to figure things out with your own faulty short-sighted memories and limited perspective.Ok, ok, I digress. You get it.Go see it. I'd love to hear what you make of it."
1852,6,Took itself too seriously. Cringe Feels mostly like a circle jerk about how great and deserving humans is. The movie also relies on the romance arc between two main characters. They have zero chemistry and it basically ruins the whole movie.
1853,1,"Worst since Captain Marvel I've been a huge marvel fan since Iron Man. This was easily the worst Marvel movie I've seen. I left the theater thinking, what was even the plot line and what was the purpose? It has nothing to do with the rest of the Marvel cinematic universe and felt purposeless. Easily my least favorite marvel movie, and one that makes me close to turning away from the franchise completely. Don't watch it."
1854,4,Didn't expect it to be that bad The previews looked promising based on visual effects and a pretty intriguing cast and premise. But that was the extent of the positives. The script and story are something a young teenager could write. The cast are beautiful and do a decent job with what they were given but that's it. It's just so poor and I was left shaking my head at least a half dozen times at bad character decisions and plot devices. Felt pretty ripped off. Also started to fall asleep 3 times.
1855,8,Really enjoyed this The critics really have no idea what they are talking about. This film is amazing it has its problems but overall it's a great watch. Every shot is done with love and care all the acting is great the story works well apart from a few points. The first act is a mess but past that point it's great.
1856,1,Absolute Snoozer Wouldn't wish this movie experience on my worst enemy. It felt like there was so much fat that should've been cut from this movie. Save yourself the time and watch anything else.
1857,1,"Horrible acting Possibly the worst plot and acting i have ever seen in my entire life. It can not get worse than this, it was absolutely horrible from the beginning until the end. There is no point to the movie, it's all over the place. Please dont waste your time and money."
1858,3,"Uggghhhh 😴 This was without a doubt the most boring MCU film I've ever seen. This movie outranks Thor the Dark World as MCU worst movie. I know this included a more diverse group of main characters when it came to race, disability, and LBGT but even that couldn't bring this to life. Sure the visuals are great, but the story line itself is so slow and dull that it doesn't seem like it makes much of a difference for any of the other films. The fact that this subject is different than the other MCU films is the biggest problem for me when I originally thought it was going to be its biggest strength. Sure I liked Sersi, but the others were just meh for me.One person told me this film is like Marvel's first DCEU movie and I can understand why because it's supposed to be darker. That is precisely why I prefer MCU over DCEU. If that's the case, then this would be in the same level as Man of Steel and BvsS.This was such a let down and I was looking for ward to this one the most, even more than Spiderman no way home."
1859,4,"Doesn't really know what it's trying to be... Eternals, the lowest rated Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet. Does it deserve that? Ugh, yeah. I didn't want to believe it but this film is a mess. It's slow, cluttered, disjointed and severely lacking charisma. With Nomadland's Chloe Zhao at the helm, Eternals takes a more ambitious and artful route, which I can somewhat appreciate. She nails the scope and atmosphere but superheroes just don't resonate with her craft. Despite a couple twists that I didn't see coming, there's little to no character in the acting, the story is overloaded with exposition, the humor feels awkward and forced, and the substandard CGI, messy editing and excessively shadowy color correction makes the action sequences a bit of an eyesore; unimpressive given past Marvel efforts. Eternals is an overlong tedious slog that doesn't really know what it's trying to be. I'd toss it in the mediocre pile with Thor: The Dark World and Captain Marvel."
1860,10,Great movie for new Gods of Marvel Movie was pure refreshment and certainly the biggest surprise of the year. Cast is amazing so are characters. Its way deeper movie with great conversations and stunig actions. Pure joyI love that Marvel is not afraid to take big risk and in my opinion it payed off.Bravo 👏 👏
1861,10,"I like it a lot It may not be perfect but seeing many critics cry is worth the watch. I believe this movie failed because of the expectations, being marketed by Academy Award Chloe Zhao. Don't get me wrong, she is very talented and competent but definitely not her best movie by any stretch of the imagination.Visuals and CGI are effing amazing.Also Gemma Chan."
1862,3,"Pretty average For a marvel movie this one ain't it.The acting didn't feel very good at all, the story was pretty weak, and the characters didn't stick.They killed off or removed most characters from the climax of the film. And even that felt rushed.Everything about this movie felt rushedIt feels like Marvel wanted to get out a quick 'money maker' right before they made the big bucks from NWH and Hawkeye releasing later this year.And the first end credit scene completely spoiled the movie for me (obvious reasons)"
1863,6,"Wasn't bad, but wasn't great. For a movie this length, there was so much potential and it was a bit of a letdown. Could've been better. Story was ok, visuals were good, but it lacked that extra spark that you get from other Marvel movies.... That thing that completely captivates you and leaves you wanting more; unfortunately it wasn't there in this movie, even with the end credit. If there will be a sequel, maybe they will up the ante next time around."
1864,1,"The worst movie I have seen in a while I went to the movies with my son and husband not knowing what to expect. I wanted to walk out of the movies in the first 15 minutes but I didn't want to spoil the fun for the rest of the family. I endured 2 and half hours of boredom and, at one point, spent some time outside the movie theater walking it off.The Eternals were boring characters that, at times, made some attempts at being funny and failing miserably. The movie dragged on forever, the story was boring, the dialogues pathetic. There was no chemistry between any of them, they were flat with barely any emotion. Some attempt at crying with fake tears running down their cheeks was almost embarrassing to watch.My son and husband also hated the movie and thought it was a complete waste of money and time."
1865,9,"IMHO it's better than than the critics say. Pity I can't give it a half star more so 9 will do. It isn't perfect (nothing is) but IMHO it's a great MCU movie. Chloe Zhao did a great job directing and for me the stand out performances, IMHO, are Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. Can't wait for the sequel."
1866,2,"Really, really poor. Dreadful plot I'm not really a fan of Marvel films but sit through them all in the cinema with the kids. My biggest issue with most of them is the sensory overload of too much happening on screen in the action scenes and an absence of peril to make you worry and care about any of the characters.Eternals is the worst of them all with very little in the way of redeeming qualities. The plot is absolute hokum and makes no sense. The characters have no chemsitry and the baddies are completely paint by numbers.The special effects are ok. I'll give it that. No idea what they were aiming for with this but they missed."
1867,6,"Again, the cast is uninspired Look at the Avengers. They are imagined as 40 yrs people and still have a better expression of their work. These eternals are like a random guy woman from the strets. Living 5 000 yrs would be great, but that will make someone more heavy like serious like, lets tage GoT because there s 2 of them, Black Fish or Jaimie L. Should have picked other actors. Salma, Jolie dont work. Only Madden can act as a serious man. Eternal. The plot is simple and only a good script and cast could work. It didnt. I think it s a dud. Almost bad."
1868,1,"Missed opportunity If you are looking for an action packed movie with some genuine comedy then this is not it. Didnt like the movie at all. It is very slow, the scenes are repetitive and at times make no sense. Humour is as good as a 4th grader would understand, timing is really bad.Yeah visuals are better off than the last 3 movies but with a massive budget (as per mcu) you'd question, where did the money go?This movie lacks creative touch and there is nothing extra ordinary abt it where you'd expect the audience to spend their hard earned money. Wait till it's out on OTT."
1869,5,"What have they done! With such a rich history and world building that could have been drawn upon this was just horrific for a Marvel history. With all of the Eternals essentially being drawn from history and given a back story this was just a bland incoherent mess of characters that I couldn't care less for and the script was just awful!With the star studded cast that was assembled for this seemed like half of them were there to get their careers back into the mainstream and a few that were just there to cash their pay check. I really wanted to like Richard Madden and Gemma Chan but no matter how much so called character development they gave them it was just bland! Nothing has been less engaging for me. Chan going from Not doing anything to killing a Celestial was just so undeserved, no true build up to the point of which she should have been able to do that. Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie and Kumail Nanjiani were certainly the crew that were cashing their pay check, No emotion nothing that made me care about any moments that they were on screen. Ma Dong-seok and Barry Keoghan might be the one ones i had a small chance to care about, mainly because of Seoks fighting style was awesome and Keoghan knocked out Sprite to shut her up!Categorically the script was awful! To the level of Josstice League level stupidity of dumb comments and and none of the comedic elements landed what so ever. Theres just nothing more to say about this! Going back to the mythological stories that each of these are based on Thor and Loki drew upon these well in the first film and there were some many opportunities to have the stories play out on screen whilst fighting the Deviants. They could have used the Deviants as Eternals that found out of the true plan for why the Elementals were sent to earth!Direction, Cinematography and green lighting this script is just disappointing after seeing Dune, Which this was one of the movies of the year.Overall If they try again with a new script and new director I'll give it a chance, Kenneth Brannah could have done a much better job in the start with these types of characters. Thor may have not been the best but its still in a class of is own compared to this, I may be able to finally forgive the bleached eye brows of Chris Hemsworth!"
1870,7,"Potential I thought this movie felt a bit messy, like there was to much and yet not enough story which at times made it feel slow. I have hope that the next move will be better though there are some great characters in it."
1871,4,"Oh dear 🙈 Critiques: The length was too long, the dialogue was boring, the jokes didn't land, too many characters, the characters lacked emotion, bad editing, too much exposition, flawed moral motivation for the ""heroes,"" predictable villain swap, lighting was too dark, horrible pacing, and bad CGI. Awful! Disney need to get rid of woke."
1872,6,"Oscar-winning movie? Marvel seeks to raise the bar by presenting an Oscar-winning directed film and spectacular locations. But is there the fa? The film splits in two. The first hour a bit slow, but this is not a problem, the first act sins in presenting the characters by characterizing them well and only 3/4 of them. The action scenes are thrown at random to make the film more compelling. The first part is rejected, then the plot changes direction and becomes much more exciting showing twists and spectacular fights. The most characterized characters always remain the same. With some practically useless Eternals that only serve to make a scene. The soundtrack is quite passive. The special effects in some situations are beautiful, in others they are messy. The direction is good but it does not emerge so much. Overall it's a mid-chart movie of all Marvel movies but it tries to differentiate itself from its old siblings.No, It's not a movie winning Oscar."
1873,8,"Very good movie It's a really good movie, great visuals and awesome cast, it's was a really fun movie and full of action and fights. Anyone who gives five stars or below to this movie are just immature white heterosexual men feeling insecure about the whole film."
1874,10,"Gorgeous I watched the movie yesterday with my cousin brothers . I had been wanting to see the movie for a really long time . And it was worth it . The visuals , the characters , the plot twist . In my opinion , sprite was the best eternal after druig . Her story was a bit sad . As she was the ""child"" of the eternals and since the eternals can not age , she would never get to experience love, and make her own family . I'm hapoy she got her hapoy ending . And as a poc myself , the rep was at point . I loved kingo and karun so much . The experience got inhanced by the fact that i was watching the movie in 4d ."
1875,9,"A different kind of Marvel film First off, I've given it a rating of 9 to counteract all the ridiculous low scores - it's not a 9, it's a solid 7. Yes, it's long and slow in places, but I've generally got a short attention span and I coped fine.For me, this is the most interesting Marvel film in a while, not for the discussions about ""Where have they been for thousands of years?"", or ""What have they done to influence mankind?"", but for the interactions between the characters, and how they come to discover things about themselves and each other. They're a fascinating bunch, and I enjoyed just seeing them together. (Also the lead actors tend to 'under-act' (is that the phrase?) quite a bit, which was refreshing.)The main plot is somewhat thin, but the scenery makes up for it, it's a beautiful-looking film (especially the last act)."
1876,1,"The worst movie I have ever seen I will lost my faith in humanity if they follow this new trend in Marvel's story.Political correctness stretched to an extent I have never seen, extremely poor acting, no chemistry between actors and bad screenplay. It was extremely boring and frustrating - first half of the movie was one big part of social engineering.I strongly advise not to watch this movie or, If you want to remember it as a dreadfully bad movie and ditch your money, do it!"
1877,1,"Boring and Trite Wow, what a painful experience. It was a waste of money and time and hard to endure the whole movie. I kept hoping it would get better and provide some kind of emotion or drama, but it kept on disappointing to the very end."
1878,8,"A Lot Better Than Expected Although this movie had been receiving a ot of negative reviews I wasn't setting my expectations based on those, I was just skeptical they could pull it off and I was wrong. I would actually give it closer to an 8.5 if I could.Even though they deviated quite a bit from what the eternals really are compared to the comics, the story was well done and made sense within the MCU. The glimpses of the MCU in the past was great and the setup for much bigger things was also well done.The movie wasn't as LGBTQ forward as some of the more negative reviews would lead one to believe either as there was one gay relationship and one deaf character for those complaining about having disabled main characters in a superhero movie.The only real problems I personally had with the film was the suicide of Ikaris, the CGI of Pip in the end credits scene and the costuming of Eros as it seemed a little thrown together. It seems like they could have done better in these area.Overall it was definitely worth a watch and I would highly recommend it."
1879,2,"Long and boring Long, confusing and just bad in general. I'm literally writing this in the cinema half way through contemplating leaving. Looks like the first marvel flop."
1880,2,"Boring - I walked out of the cinema So for context I'm a big Marvel fan, but for the first time I actually walked out of the cinema. The story was convoluted and confusing. The actors (while are very good TV actors) could not make the jump to being in a blockbuster. Every joke was flat and felt forced.Am quite worried in the direction Marvel is heading ever since End Game with a slew of average and bad movies.Also this was meant to be the diverse, inclusive and woke film but they still found time to make fun of Bollywood and Indian culture so well done everyone."
1881,4,"No Emotional Attachment. As I watched this movie, I did not find myself emotionally invested with any of the characters. With Iron Man movies, Tony started out as self obsessed, ego-maniac but during the course of these movies Tony has several life changing events (becoming accountable the weapons he builds, almost dying from Palladium, suffering from PTSD) which changes him and I feel for him and find myself rooting for him. In the Captain American movies, when Dr. Erskine makes Steve Rogers promise that whatever happens with the super soldier transformation, that he will stay who he is, not a perfect soldier but a good man, to which Steve holds up his glass and says ""to the little guys"". And when Steve doesn't give up on Bucky through Captain American The Winter Soldier and in Civil War, we can't help getting emotionally attached. In Thor, he too starts off as Odin tells him you are a vain, greedy, cruel boy and then changes during the course of the movie and gives his life to save the town, we get choked up with emotion for him. These are the big three, all the other characters Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Dr. Strange, Starlord, Black Panther, Black Widow, Hulk, Bucky, Groot, Gamora, Rhody, Coulson, Captain Marvel, Scarlet Witch, Quick Silver, Falcon, Loki, Mantis, Drax, Vision, Wasp, Rocket and on and on, we all loved them. But with the Eternals, I was not emotional invested in any of them, their limited back story didn't have me rooting for any of them except maybe Gilgamesh. I left the theater without the emotional high I am usually accustomed to after seeing a Marvel movie, but rather eh."
1882,8,"Enjoyable Enjoyable, great visual effects and likable characters for the most part. Not as bad as most people say but definitely not the best mcu film. The pacing felt weird, the movie felt rushed despite it being two hours and thirty minutes."
1883,6,"Not Terrible, Just Mediocre After hearing the negative reviews I was ready to watch something terrible, however I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't terrible, just mediocre. Lets start with the pros, I thought that the movie was fairly funny, the usual brand of Marvel comedy, and while the reviews made the run time seem daunting I thought it was fairly well paced.Still, there are quite a few negatives, my main being that it felt like a lot of wasted potential. Never before has a Marvel film been juggling so many different themes and characters at the same time and without getting into spoilers I think some of the ideas were fascinating, the problem is that while juggling so many characters it was difficult for Chloe Zhao, the director, to ever really fully explore any of them. The villains of the film, the deviants, begin off incredibly bland but, small spoiler here, they start stealing the powers of eternals and using them to evolve. This was a great idea which was never explored, one deviant gained the two most boring powers and never really did anything with them before dying. The cast is decent but I never connected with any of them, I had heard good things about the cinematography but to be honest it felt kind of lacklustre as well. The music was forgettable and the villains boring. There were loads of great ideas at play here (the majority of which I can't mention without major spoilers) but in the end none of them really came to fruition, if you're a die hard Marvel fan like me it isn't as bad as the reviews have said but if you are a casual viewer you may as well skip this one and just google the post credits scenes. 6/10."
1884,10,way better than people say I really enjoyed this movie and don't get the hate it's getting at all. I also have some criticisms but I didn't feel like there were huge problems: it's way too long for its own good and i didn't particularly feel too attached to some characters because there's 10 of them and all new faces. But overall i think it's a great movie and not the worst Marvel movie as some people say.
1885,10,"Simply amazing The acting is great, the visuals are fantastic, the story is ground breaking. There really is nothing not to like and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the 2 hours and 38 minutes. The people who don't like this movie are not true marvel fans or their brains are too small to appreciate the brilliant writing."
1886,9,"Such an amazing movie with amazing representation It was a great movie with lots of action and comedy, and a hell of a lot of widespread representation which I really value, I just wish they had gone into each character a bit more before the fight but other than that it was amazing."
1887,10,"Well I loved it. Stop expecting Avengers all the time, it's different and it's amazing. Love all the characters, the humour is great, the story is cool too I don't know how someone can be bored by this, shocking comments and ratings to be honest."
1888,5,"Why do over 5000 years of shared history only a few different scenes? The film does a good job introducing the characters and is visually stunning, although it relies more heavily on CGI for the last bit of the movie. What really bothers me about this movie was the heavy use of exposition e.g. Early on Kingo makes the reference to Peter Pan and that Sprite is in love with Icarus. This is repeated two more times to explain / justify her action. I believe most people got it the first time round.Icarus ans Sersi have a 5000 years spanning relationship. Yet we only see them together in the beginning, Babylon and when they get married. These scenes are used on multiple occasions throughout the movie. My problem with this is, that they do not transport the emotions of this long-term, deeply committed relationship. It's simply not believable. Why not use scenes from other time periods or were they just together for two short time periods?Although the story in my eyes was perfectly fine and deep enough, the execution was bad. I expected more."
1889,7,"I know it is painful but people have to move on, the world expands and not everything is about the avangers If people want Marvel to tell stories which have a build up for 10 years they have to allow Marvel to expand the world and introduce new characters and concepts.Take it as a nessessary bad, although i think that the Eternals movie was a good standalone movie to give an insight to how the celestials run the universe.The movie altogether was solid, the writing had a few problems and the acting did not managed to connect the audience with the characters because of that, but the role of the movie stayed the same, introducing the eternals and celestials to the audience and it did its job well.I mean i had no great expectations for this movie, and i understand that it is basically a building block for Marvel to give depth to their world.Was it entertaining? Kinda.Could it do a better job? Yes.Should you watch it? It is not terrible, and it is a story with an open ending but with a conclusion what makes the movie a whole, so yes, you should.You know if you are a fan of the MCU you play the long game, if only every second or third of their movies will be an action packed blockbuster it is not the end of the world, people tend to forget that the best stories in the Marvel comics are only enjoyable if you know their backgrounds."
1890,7,"It was pretty ok, but the ending is dumb. The film is pretty good and it's fairly entertaining, but the ending is just dumb! They stopped trillions of lives from beggining just because they loves Earth, like come on!"
1891,5,"Underdeveloped plot and flat characters. Great CGI. From the director of ""Nomadland"" which I truly enjoyed, I was expecting way more. Chloé Zhao won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture and she is good at telling some kind of stories, but her lack of experience with superhero movies is noticeable. This film is painfully slow and definitely too long, because some storylines take too much screen time. There were basically 7000 years of plot to cover, but the screenplay focuses on some useless story lines, that do not have any kind of impact on the plot. It needs to be heavily cut down. Another thing that I found really annoying is that the movie tells multiple times that ""Eternals"" is part of the MCU, like the audience is composed of a bunch of kids that cannot connect the dots. Disney has been building this narrative universe for more than 10 years. People got the fact that every movie or TV show that Marvel Studios releases is part of it, no need to reiterate. There was a lot of potential, but they did not explore these characters enough and by the end of it, I feel like I barely knew them, so I was not attached to any of them. The acting felt really flat, despite having some class A actors such as Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. They were not at all convincing. I wonder who decided to hire Gemma Chang, because she portrays one of the most important characters, but she is the most unimpressive element of the cast.I liked how they developed the Celestials and Arishem. I see a lot of potential in this storyline and I hope that they will write an interesting plot for them. CGI is well done and fight scenes are a little bit different than the average Marvel movie, with tons of creative effects. Overall it looks good and also way better than the recently released ""Black Widow"". I think that the Deviant design was captivating and I enjoyed their evolution from primal creatures to sentient beings. It gave them a lot of depth and I wish that the movies could focus on this aspect more. There is a little bit of cheesy comedy, but I have to say I have really appreciated the DC references, and found it genuinely funny.If you are a Marvel fan and you are following the MCU, I guess that you need to watch this movie, in order to fully understand the future entries of the franchise, otherwise it is avoidable. If you have a Disney+ subscription, just wait for the release on the streaming service, no need to waste money going to the theatre, like I did. Underdeveloped plot and flat characters. Great CGI."
1892,6,"Visually spectaculair, but too much talking. I wasn't familiair with the Eternals, so I have to judge this movie on its own merits. As to that, I have some serious doubts. Yes, the movie looks awesome, the CGI is amazing, and the action sequences are thrilling. But what I missed was the feeling of being drawn into the narrative, of being involved with the characters and their stories, of real urgency for all the goings on.What did not help was the extremely complicated main story, and also the fact that there were just too many characters to have to relate to, which was pretty hard, even in two and a half hours, so as a result their backgrounds mostly stayed vague or even unfathomable. What didn't help either were those long stretches of endless talking, it brought the movie time and again to an almost standstill.Some of the actors seemed strangely misplaced as intended god-like super-hero (Barry Keoghan, Lauren Ridloff, Kumail Nanjiani), others were hardly convincing (like Angelina Jolie) or didn't even seem to try (like Richard Madden, who apparently thought that his character constantly had to look and act grim and stone-faced!). My real favorites by the way were Gemma Chan as Sersi and Ma Dong-seok as Gilgamesh.I understood from the ending, that there are many eventful things to come in the next sequel(s), so maybe I have to consider this first movie more as a preliminary introduction. But if by introduction you think of getting gradually enlightened in the main story, it failed."
1893,5,Meh The film is ok but has some pacing issues and felt too long at times. But I enjoyed the ending and the post credit scenes. I feel overall though they tried to include too much and it felt messy in parts and is definitely one of the more forgettable mcu films.
1894,5,"I watched it before my exam day,totally disappointing. To be honest,I was bored. I am a big fan of Game of Thrones and so I was so much excited to watch Kit Harington and Richard Madden together. I had huge expectations for this movie,but they failed to satisfy my taste. I watched it before my exam day and I am totally disappointed. I wasted my time. But still,I love marvel and I am still waiting to watch them back again. I hope they will come back strongly."
1895,10,"Watch it for yourself. Went in not expecting much because of the reviews but i loved it, I ended up just relaxing and going for the ride! Didn't even get up to pee because I didn't want to miss anything."
1896,8,"An epic story of love Honestly such a great movie! I will say the action isn't my favorite in terms of Marvel action, Shang-Chi had better fight scenes, but I think it tells such a beautiful story of family and how we show love that we don't see in other Marvel films. I think this one will have some lasting impact on the franchise and sets a number of things up for future films, so I'm excited to see where we go from here."
1897,5,"I did not like it at all I did not like it at all. I kept watching my watch to leave the room, too long, messy, acting was really bad. It looked more like a fashion show movie. Anyways, awesome effort. It's always fun to watch a super hero movie."
1898,8,"Unexpected POV Eternals is the pawn for Celestial to birth their kind, and Thanos actually want to postpone the celestial birth all over the universe in avengers invinity war.Seems like avengers endgame go with happy ending but it bring another problem for earth. Nobody is the villain, some eternals want to prevent earth from extintion, some other want to please their creator celestial, deviant want exist for his kind.Interesting how Marvel will assemble them with the other superhero in the future. 8/10."
1899,7,"A little forgettable but ok I thought it was an average marvel film. I went in thinking it would be a little disappointing due to the amount of negative reviews. I do kind of understand but it wasn't that bad. It was a solid 7.5 and was also kind of funny in an indirect way and that worked most of the time. I thought the acting at time was a bit weird but most of the delivery was on point. The story was a little confusing with a lot of names and hard to follow. The first end credit scene was a joke but the second one was worth the wait till the end. Most of the characters I have forgotten their names and didn't really care for. However, I still had a good time watching it. I watched black widow and Shang chi and every other Marvel film in the cinema since age of Ultron and never before have people walked out because of Boredom. This is the third film of phase 4 and so far they haven't impressed me. I'm interested to see what Spider-Man like is in December. And for that I give eternals a 7.5."
1900,4,"Exposition: The Movie When I first saw the trailers for Eternals, I thought it was just going to be a boring, soulless film only meant to set up future Marvel movies and expand this already huge cinematic universe which is rare since I usually enjoy it when Marvel embraces the weirder side of it's franchise. It also didn't help that phase 4 of Marvel hasn't been impressing me. Outside of the fantastic Shang Chi and really good Loki show on Disney+, I have found phase 4 to be very boring so when the reviews came out for Eternals, I wasn't surprised in the least bit but I was willing to give it a chance since I saw a lot of people I follow on Instagram saying it was a great movie so I thought ""okay, maybe I could like this. After all, there are times where I am in the minority on a movie.""So I saw the movie the weekend it came out and you wanna know what I think? It was exactly what I thought it would be: boring, dull, uninspiring and devoid of substance. The biggest issue with this movie is that it is filled with exposition. The film opens with a super lazy looking text crawl that looks like it was made in windows movie maker that goes over the creation of the Eternals and the threat of the movie: the deviants and later on, there's a scene with Gemma Chen who's talking with a celestial and we see this scene of exposition. And I can't forget about the multiple and pointless flashback scenes that add nothing but, you guessed it, exposition.The characters in this film are awful. Most of them are just boring, forgettable, cringe, you don't care about them and are just there to dump exposition. Out of all of them I only liked one: Kingo. He was the only character in the whole movie who had any sort of personality. I guess you could say the director guy he was with and Kit Harington also had personality but they were hardly in the film.The villain of this film is Ikaris which was a weird decision considering he was marketed as the lead character (which is even stranger considering this movie has no lead character and they all feel like side characters in a movie focusing on nobody) and his character just isn't that interesting. He's just discount Superman from Man Of Steel. I know people say Superman in that movie is boring and uninteresting and I wouldn't disagree with them but this is worse. He's an awful character and he's a very forgettable villain as well.Call me nitpicking all you want but I'm not wrong. This is exactly what I was afraid of. There's no substance here it's just a bunch of exposition. As for some more positives, I did like the post credits scene and the music and visuals were absolutely stunning but that's about it. If you enjoyed you time watching this film, that's great. For me, this was a waste of time. One of the MCU's worst."
1901,1,"Worst superhero movie ever Congratulations on all other D class super hero movies. We have found one that's worse. Sub-par acting, sub-par visual effects. And most of all a sub-par script. That is 2 hours I will never get back. Don't bother watching this movie."
1902,8,"The Best Part not the Problem It is shameful that multiple media outlets are allowing user reviews of this film's same-sex representation as a negative to feed headlines. The family displayed here was something amazing and special that was directed beautifully. If having such representation is problematic and considered woke as a negative, then the world is sick. To other critics who believe the problem with the film was the directing and the two together are negatively impacting this director's career, you are just wrong. The casting, directing, plot, and special effects are the movie's positives. This movie however has real production and editing problems. There were multiple points that I found were unalligned to previous things said, and way too much cut. You could tell something else was filmed in multiple places throughout this movie, which was also too long, but were edited out incoherently. So much needed to be in that was obviously cut, whereas so much needed to be cut that was left in, making it unnecessarily lengthy. The time could have been the same if the right scenes were kept more wholly while taking out scenes that added no value or understanding."
1903,6,"Applaud trying something different - but it's a mess After 20+ films I appreciate the film makers trying to break a historical formula.BUT, they have crammed way too many ideas, characters and universe expanding elements into one film.Given the film had an additional year to finesse the final cut, it's disappointing to think they thought this was good enough."
1904,1,"The worst movie of Marvel so far I was so disappointed after watching this. So boring, such long dialogs, me and my friend fall asleep at some point.I thought nothing can be worse that ""Captain Marvel"", but this one was."
1905,7,It's a good weekend Movie This movie is by far not the best of MCU it was a little slow at first and was lacking that next level threat that each and every previous MCU movie had. The bad guys didn't really seem threatening I just feel they could of done a little Better! Great visuals and the chem between the externals was weird and didn't seem to be there at times. The character build up throughout the movie was like that of a budget movie you see on different media platforms but once it's revealed what's really goin on it gets better!
1906,6,"Too many main characters The reason films like Thor and Iron man worked is because they followed a single main character and their journey. The characters change over time.This story follows lots of main characters that seem to stay the same though-out, or show their true colours, but no actual character development. I didn't connect with or really care about any of the characters.Also, that sex scene was the most pointless sex scene in the history of movies. Achieved nothing and just made it awkward because there were legit kids in the movie theatre right infront of me.Also, Robb Stark and Jon Snow having a relationship with someone called 'Cercei' just kept taking me out of the story to roll my eyes. Couldn't they have chosen a different name for the love interest?2.5 hours of constant skipping from flashbacks to present, with different characters, never spending enough time with any one character to actually care about them.... I just got bored honestly."
1907,8,"New set of supposed superheros Eternals is yet another Marvel Universe list of supposed superheros who emerge after Avengers Endgame. Chloe Zhao did a great job showcasing the backstories of each character and letting us know that they were actually evil and created by a celestial god. Each planet was created to achieve the largest amount of habitants and then destroyed just to give birth to a celestial being. From this instance we learn that Kurt Russell's character Ego from GOTG Vol 2 was a Celestial being. The externals were lead by supposed Olympians like Ajax (Salma Hayek), Ikuris (Richard Madden) as a villain, Thena (Angelina Jolie), and Sersi (Gemma Chan). Kit Harrington has a few scenes and he has a clips at the end of the movie that I don't want to spoil. Loved Kuwait Nanjiani as Kingo who was hilarious as well as Harry Styles who has some part in a future sequel. Overall it was fun to see how these characters played a large part in our history and help develop our civilization to what we become. It was great to see a new set of characters but I always ask where are the Avengers when you need them. They are mentioned in some parts of the movie, but at least have a cameo from some of them. I would definitely say to check this out if you like Marvel and fantasy type of flicks."
1908,8,"It's quite good The movie is entertaining and is building a good base for the next one. I don't know why it received any negative publicity.The only fault I can find is with a lot of repetition like 'I won't do it, I can't do it, no you have to do it, okay I will do it' kind of scenarios."
1909,5,"Had Lots of Potential, But Is Underwhelming Even with this film, I don't think the MCU should stop trying new things. Even if this film was mediocre, with the right crew, they can make a great and unique film.With that said, I'm very mixed about Eternals. I liked some of the film, but not enough to warrant a good review.THE GOOD: -I loved the visuals in this film. I actually think that Eternals has one of the best visual effects in the MCU, with it's beautiful scenery, great effects on the super powers, and having good designs for the deviants.-While some are underwhelming, I enjoyed a few of the characters. I thought Thena's characters was unique and interesting, with her losing her memories, and going crazy. It's a shame we didn't see more of her in action. Even if we saw barely anything of him, I really liked Phastos. I thought he was a funny and kind of investing. Another character I really liked was Makkari. Even if she couldn't say a word, I really liked her personality, and her speed effects were one of the best I've seen in a long time. I also thought Kingo was funny, and I liked him.-Unlike others, I didn't find the film to be that boring. The 2h 37m were actually pretty fast for me.-I thought the fight scenes were visually stunning, action packed, and a lot of fun.-Even if it failed, I appreciate the MCU for trying something different with their storytelling with this film.THE BAD: -Besides the characters I listed above, the other characters were either boring, unlikable, or poorly written. I thought Ikkaris was boring, and his twist of being the villain was just kind of thrown into the mixed. I thought Sersi was boring, and she was one of the main characters throughout the film. I could care less about Druig and Gilgamesh, and Ajak is barely in the film. I thought Sprite was annoying, and her helping Ikkaris to wipe out Earth had poor reasoning him, with her just loving him.-The film tries to have lots of emotional moments, like Gilgamesh getting killed, or Sprite wanting to be a normal human. But those moments are all underwhelming because we don't know much about these characters, and their motivations in life-The film tries to introduced a lot of Mythology into the MCU, and it feels like they're trying to shove so much mythology in, that it just becomes a mess.-The story can feel repetitive, with the story introducing characters, and a deviant fight in the middle of it. It just kind of gets old.In conclusion, while some of the film was pretty good, a lot of it is poorly executed, or badly written. I liked some of the film, but it feels kind of frustrating to talk about."
1910,5,"Introduction Just Marvel make this movie, like when introduced Marvel for Avengers End Game. To notice we have them too. If the movie doesn't have good actors it was no more than a 5-star rating. I am sorry but I was aspect more from this movie."
1911,7,"Good, solide movie- just a bit too slow In general I liked the serious tone of the movie. It's a good movie to start a new phase in the MCU, but probably we all are inpatient to wer this all will be build up, resulting in an unfair unsatisfactory with current releases, but I give them credit, that in retrospective this will feel different.On its own, I felt that the movie could be a bit faster. Especially in the beginning I felt too slow, without building a good tension with that. I think, one of the first films of this should not be the second longest in the MCU, but I found that out after seeing it- what perfectly matched my experience.Overall, a good movie to watch, not only for marvel fans."
1912,9,Great visuals great plot watch only in Theaters I was very sad once I saw ratings for eternals but omg it was AWESOME!!!!... How could anyone hate this the only bad thing was the fact that there were so many Indian references like Varun talking in Hindi or the Gupta empire and the wedding in Indian style. While I understand the fact that most marvel fans are in India it was a bit much.
1913,8,"A SUPERHERO MOVIE WITH BIG AND MEANINGFUL IDEA Eternals is Different concept in MCU for sure!That's why some people can't digest it they want to see only simple and trending genre.First of all I enjoyed the movie 🎥 🍿...whole star cast is amazing.Visual effects are beautiful, good representation and some Indian elements for Indian fans...😉 like it😍.Lastly Chloe Zhao did an exceptional job as director.Loved it 😍"
1914,5,"Still very much a Marvel film! But one that I kinda liked. 59/100Watching this in IMAX gives you a clear understanding as to what the studio actually had in control... that being nothing, of course... That incohesiveness isn't shown the most from the film's writing and characters -that second one being, most likely, the films strongest aspect, without being the best it could've been-, but from a technical standpoint itself. Zhao has a style where, it's cinematography is her top priority, even treating it sometimes like another character, a great example of this is her Oscar-winning film; Nomadland in contrast to this feels like a huge letdown.The film's writing style doesn't allow it's own characters to reach its full potential. That has got to be the most annoying factor of this whole mess. Some plot changes and other rearrangements could've helped but, I guess Marvel has to hold on to that ""this is the most different Marvel has ever felt"" marketing strategy. That's a whole other thing, this still very much feels like another Marvel movie, but this time around, that intentional differentiator is nothing but the facade of a very strategized intention, one that leaves you dissatisfied at the studio once you leave the theater because, at that moment, you realized what Eternals could've become if studios didn't ""interfere"" (yes, pun intended)."
1915,1,"Easily the worst MCU movie. Just skip it. This movie was easily the worst movie in the entirety of the MCU. If you were thinking about watching it, please reconsider and do not. Every character is one dimensional and stupid. The movie basically has no plot. What were they thinking?????"
1916,7,"Good... just Too long, too formulaic and too cross promotional I saw the latest Marvel movie, Eternals the other day, and I've since read that it has received the worst reviews of any of the Marvel movies.It's actually not that bad... in fact I enjoyed it. It branches out from the same old characters in Avengers and co., it provides diversity that fits well and makes sense, and it provides a detailed and cool back story to the broader Marvel Universe. And it looked a million bucks... sumptuous colours, great fight scenes, Kumail Nanjiani steals the show...yada yada yada.But it did provide a few bits that niggled.(1) The characters. The first three you'll meet are Superman, The Flash and Wonder Woman. I mean, that's not their names, they are Ikarus, Sersi and Thena but that's the power sets and templates they've pinched from DC. Kinda generic and unadventurous, but that's not the movie's fault, that's Marvel.(2) It's overlong. At 2 hours 36 in a darkened cinema wearing a mask that forces you to rebreath the same carbon dioxide you just breathed out, it's a perfect storm for an unintentional snooze. There was a LOT of padding... a hell of a lot... which, edited better, would have made for a tighter film.(3) Blatant and repetitive cross promotion. This, in my opinion, is the biggest and most common flaw to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. Characters are inserted into storylines with the most tenuous connection and very little need to the narrative, only to promote the next Marvel release. It takes you, the viewer, out of the story, destroys the suspension of disbelief and reminds you that these are just products we are being sold. Christopher Nolan didn't do it in the Batman films, it didn't happen in the Joker movie, so it IS possible to stick to the art and the story in telling a super-hero yarn, without resorting to being a carney telling people to ""step right up"" for our next show. I also saw Shang-Chi on the same weekend and there it was again... blatant as can be.On IMDB the aggregate ratings average was 6.9. Sounds about right."
1917,7,"Good movie, with easy to point out flaws Eternals has so many materials to make a great mcu movie. The visuals and cinematography is breathtaking to watch, the action is pretty good, a lot of interesting lore and history dealing with the celestials and the universe in general, some great end credits scenes, good direction from Chloe zhao, and fantastic scenes of characters interacting either for comedy or drama (my favorite scene involves druig not being able to save people from genocide). However, it is not a perfect film. While all the actors do their best and all give great performances (standouts are kumail nanjiani, don lee, Brian tyree Henry, and Angelina Jolie for me) the characters are not given much development and as a result I care less for (there were some I did care for but not many), the villains suck, some actors are wasted (selma Hayek and bill skarsgard especially), so many emotional moments (except one with don and Angelina) I felt nothing for, tries to do way too much in one movie, and while some of the twists sound cool on paper in execution the motivations to why they happen are not developed well so they don't have the impact they should. Far from the worst mcu movie and not even close to the worst comic book movie ever made, just a pretty good film with some undeniable flaws."
1918,8,"Most mature movie of Marvel serie I like the slow paced storytelling, the not clear cut of ""Good vs Evil"" that relates more with real life. Human issues are not all black or all white. I thought the topics of freedom, life's personal purposes and group mission, good and evil were interesting. It wasn't just special effects just for the kick of it. The characters were developed . The movie had more depth than the other Marvel movies. But I can see why it would be a downer for the people who are used to fast paced fast food action flicks. I loved it."
1919,8,"They stole Steven Universe's plot I just came here to address how similar is this story to Steven Universe, the cluster and how a team of super heroes teams up to stop a giant being growing inside planet Earth, fighting against the divine entities who created them..."
1920,4,Most boring MCU movie Honestly I was bored by this movie until the last 30 minutes! Most everyone in the theatre was also! Many people got up walked out and came back later! This movie felt like they tried to fit too much into it! Plus the performances were flat and emotionless! At no point during the movie did I feel like the movie needed to be told! It doesn't help that Richard Madden's performance brought the whole movie down because there is no interaction between him and anyone during the whole movie that seems genuine!
1921,9,"Its a great movie. Great visuals, its amazing in imax 3D, maybe more interasting then Shang chi. It is a intrasting story, celestials look awesome. For me it was very good. Maybe depands od the mood."
1922,10,"Crafty and Beautiful Wonderful movie! Amazing storyline and visual effects. Comedy, romance, suspence and action are well crafted into this beautiful narrative. This movie has an important role in building up phase 4 of MCU. MUST WATCH."
1923,10,"Best marvel movie to date Just watched Eternals in IMAX today. It is by far the deepest marvel movie I have watched to date that touches fundamental questions such as the purpose of life for both humans and gods. There are several surprising and emotional moments that really impressed me. The CGI is also spectacular in IMAX. I would put this movie in the same league as Avengers Infinity War, although they are completely different types of movie. In comparison, movies such as ShangQi have much less depth and lasting impressions. I would give Eternals a solid ten."
1924,8,"This movie is not for everybody Eternals is a movie of human history and symbolism is great, has a good photographyI don't understand the criticsAlso has to post credits scenes, the last one with blade."
1925,8,A different kind of marvel movie This movie was a different kind of marvel movie. It was a lot more dramatic dealing with more of the emotions it drew a lot from humanity and how connected these eternals were with humans and the love they had for the human race. The cinematography was also outstanding. For a movie that was 2 hours and 37 min long I never checked the time once.
1926,8,"I really liked it and can't wait for the sequel I really enjoyed the movie. All action scenes were proportional with character developments. I think we will find answers for our questions in the sequel. I just don't understand negative comments here; this is a movie, not a cartoon. You can't expect to see action scenes all the time like in Transformers which is by the way super exhausting to watch."
1927,1,"Weird and not appropriate for families This is less of a marvel movie and more of a moral tale for humanity with deep themes of love and violence. As such, this movie is just not fun. Somehow, Black Widow has a lot to say but was entertaining. This one just sucks.And to parents of younger kids: steer clear of this one."
1928,1,"Below Par Two words review - ""Eternal Garbage"". The First marvel movie which is below par on script, cast and acting. The script lacked logic and the flow of events did not have any marvel class. For the Marvel fanatics, this is a true disappointment in all aspects. Even the graphics were way to childish."
1929,5,Externals marathon movie Went today for this 2 1/2 hour snooze fest. Actors looked promising and I am a fan of the marvel movies so this seemed like a no brainer. It was long and it was tedious. The premise is how the eternals save earth and the human race from their own race/planet? Not sure what to call them as people apparently doesn't fit. They spend something like 7000 years doing it and go through many decades that we get to see bits and pieces of as time marches on. So yes we do lots of time jumps. The group ends up scattered across the earth and are eventually called back together to destroy it but have now made connections and seen humanity and want to give it a chance even as others in the group want to destroy it and return home- which doesn't really exist. Now they start fighting each other. It's quite a convoluted movie. The optics are great and special effects are pretty cool but the story sucks and some of the acting was less than stellar. ( Jolie's storyline was just ridiculous). Hayak was wasted on this as well as Harrington. I had such hopes for this movie but was sadly disappointed. Which means there is sure to be a sequal .
1930,1,"Is time I say the truth This movie was so bad and boring. And something that also bother me is the standard of people now days are really bad this is what some people consider as a 10/10. I watch the mcu movie and am a fun but even me criticize the mcu when they make bad movie but someo of the mcu kid when give it a good score no matter what. As many problems this movie have some people will still say this movies is perfect just because it as a mcu intro at the beginning, the same people that are defending this movie say that the rotten tomatoes are wrong are the same people that will praise them for giving all dc movies are bad score, honestly dc have had a lot of flop but they are learning and making better movies now their as been no bad dc movies seems 2020, dc movie are all different and have different theme they have different style dark and fun and masterpieces of film why mcu movies are all the same that why dc have 8 oscars and mcu have none, but when they make bad movies they are praised and not criticized that why they will all ways make the same type of movies. I know my review is going to be dislike because of saying the truth but I don't care it not right and that why I have not watch all mcu movie from this year apart from eternal and I have not miss anything."
1931,10,"Eternals needs a sequel It's not the best MCU movie ever, but it doesn't deserve the hate. The characters are likable and leave me wanting to see them more. The film has good ideas too. I would like to see a sequel."
1932,1,"Surprisingly Disappointing It's the first time I found myself bored in a Marvel film this surprised me as I am an avid Marvel fan. When watching Marvel films, you know there would be action with an excellent plot however this time I did not feel gripped, excited or wowed by any of it. For the first time it had adult themes (sex scene and same sex kissing) we have always gone as a family to watch Marvel films so we now feel we cannot trust Marvel films with our children or will in the future be more wary before bringing our children. Next time we will have to put feelers out in advance to decide whether or not we will go to watch Marvel films as a family."
1933,8,"100% CBM This wears its comic book roots right on its sleeve, loud and proud. It reminded me of Aquaman and Guardians of the Galaxy in the level of fun it has in being a CBM.It's epic in scope both geographically and chronologically. It is a huge story with big ideas. The action is well choreographed and it looks beautiful.There is plenty to chew on for the Marvel obsessive but it's very accessible for casual lsd too."
1934,9,Not the avengers so don't compare I enjoyed this film. I feel those who didn't like it went in expecting it to be on par with the avengers. Their is a multi film plan with Eternals and it was a great introduction to the cast. If you take it on its own with the future of it in mind you should enjoy the movie.
1935,4,"Dreadful movie Actually started off ok, but never picked after the first 10 mins.Plot was a joke and although the film had some good actors it just didn't work. Nothing made any sense, the only good thing was they weren't afraid to kill off some of the characters."
1936,10,"Wonderful! Ignore the haters. Go with an open mind. The task that this movie had to undertake was colossal. It had to introduce a ton of characters, explain their evolution over thousands of years, explain their history and most of all, make the audience care. Add to that the plot line, and it would scare any director. But Chloe Zhao took on the challenge and did an amazing work with it! I cared by the end of it, about each eccentric character. She did an amazing job imbibing humour, tragedy and life to these characters. She made them human and I adored this story to bits. I don't know why it has been rated so low. I guess fan culture has its drawbacks because it's become akin to religion and anything that deviates from their expectations tends to leave people feeling bemused. The only thing that will stop you from enjoying this movie is your own hang up about the MCU.All in all, one of the better Marvel films, definitely different and an enjoyable experience."
1937,8,"LGBT Norse mythology A lot to enjoy here, good twists, exciting action, strong character relationships and not too predictable. Can only presume poor reviews are because god forbid there is a diverse cast with diverse relationships. It's something different from marvel and that's what makes it worth watching."
1938,10,"Definitely different Different but enjoyable. Eternals delivers, don't listen to the bad reviews. Marvel is heading into a new direction and it's much needed. Marvel has done it again with amazing story telling and visuals."
1939,7,"It wasn't that bad (no spoilers) I'm writing this from the perspective of a person that has never seen more than two or three Marvel's movies and it's not a great fan. I entered the cinema without any expectations about it but turns out I ended up liking it because I think it was entertaining and contained the exact amount of humour and reality. Am I fascinated? No, but I also think people are being too hard on it and should give it another chance when the sequel comes out because maybe there you'll find the real action or the content you were waiting for."
1940,10,"HOW COULD Y'ALL GIVE BAD REVIEW? LIKE HOW? Let's not talk about the comics issue. I got emotional from all characters, in my opinion the connection between each eternals perfectly blend.Let say the Avengers cast need long story bla and bla then finally bounding to each hero, the eternals itself no need that time much which i think is quite impressive to connect as they reunited as one.And not only focusing on fighting scene, the eternals has cinematic sceneries is to be seen a lot, and thanks to chloe zhao to bring different identically marvel movie.I really enjoyed this movie a lot. Screw to the people that complain about storyline, no emotion, and bad CGI. Like what do you expecting? Plot twist original serial killer documentary film from marvel?"
1941,5,"The pace of the movie was eternal I was apprehensive when I heard that a docudrama director was going to direct Eternals. Chloe is good at what she is familiar with, but to take on a MCU action film, I guess I had high hopes. The comic fans would be disappointed and so was I.I understand its definitely not an easy feat to introduce so many characters and bring them up strong within a single movie (and more so, as a 1st of whatever more sequels to come). The actors did the best they could, but the lack of chemistry was obvious. Come on, they have been together for 7000 years. It was awkward and the dialogue was unnatural, especially at the dining table they gathered. The comic timing was so off, the too many sunsets - cliché, the pace was just eternal, and the script-writing could be better.The Eternals somewhat were portrayed more human than immortals, Sersi was weak, Sprite had insecurities, and everyone expected more from Thena and Ajax (what a waste of casting Angelina and Salma but using so little of them). The only strong and consistent female Eternal was Makkari. The male Eternals seem stronger but still, none left an impression.My only consolation was the composer, Ramin Djawadi who also composed for Iron Man 1, seemed fitting, as he first sets the pace for both the Avengers and the Eternals. He did well.Overall, its an average movie. But probably this one is my least favourite of all MCU movies."
1942,6,"Eternals- could have been extra better First of all all wait for end card as there are 2 post credit scenes..plz watch that and come out without forgetting .If u r a marvel fan,then u can go and watch this movie for visual and eye catch experience.the story syas about the BC period and them comes to recent 2021. If u were going to think of a question if they were present entire duration BC to 2021 AD till now then y they didnt help Avengers??( As they weren't planned to take this movie😅😅 earlier) they itself explained it as soon as the movie starts.Over all it had given a good time but I think they need to focus more on the upcoming next part as well."
1943,7,"It was good (no spoilers) I'm writing this from the perspective of a person that has never seen more than two or three Marvel's movies and I'm not a great fan of fiction/fantasy. I entered the cinema without any expectations about it but turns out I'm surprised about it because. I think it was entertaining and with the exact amount of humour. Am I fascinated? No, but I also think people are being too hard on it and should give it another chance when the sequel comes out because maybe there will be real action or the content they were waiting for."
1944,8,"Very Good Movie, Could've Had More Action I thought this movie could've finished the movie off with the Eternals battling Arishem. Of course, in some Marvel movies, they end on an unsatisfactory note. I thought that this took a little bit away from the experience, but not all was lost. Post-credits, we were introduced to Pip the Troll and Eros aka Starfox (played by Harry Styles.) This brought a little bit of hope to the audience as we will all be expecting an interesting sequel in Eternals 2."
1945,10,"Easily one of the best in MCU franchise I liked this movie a lot because it made me feel how beautiful this planet earth and the humanity are after watching this movie. Yes, we all have flaws but there is also beauty to us all.Eternals is one of the best movies in entire MCU franchise!"
1946,6,"Meh I guess it's ok, the visuals were great but I was so bored it's story is so boring the acting is decent, but my god it went on for ever the story is amazing but I can't see it getting as equal, but I am glad they tried something new."
1947,4,"A boring and bland Marvel movie, until it becomes the most ridiculous thing you will ever see. The second half of this movie had me at an utter loss for words. It is by far the most ridiculous story ever created by Marvel, harder to understand and more convoluted than what you would ever expect from this kind of movie, reaching comical levels at times. It also features a cast that has little to none chemistry, jokes that never land and a runtime that exceeds any acceptable level for this kind of story. The movie is actually saved by it's ridiculousness starting at about the end of the first third, from which point it at least leaves you speechless and at awe of what you are witnessing. The -Gods of Egypt- of Marvel movies, actually an incredible experience when you watch it with friends, but a really really disappointing movie at its core. I have no idea how Marvel is going to continue from this point forward."
1948,1,"The ""WORST"" Marvel Movie I Have Ever Seen! And yes this is coming from a true Marvel fan who has never missed a Marvel movie in the theatre since 2008.Much like Joss Whedon's Justice league, this movie tries to fit a lot of main characters within 150 mins, and that's where it fails. Chloé Zhao, you should have never agreed to this one. This could have been such a great series! Every character could have their own 40 min episode, and with stars like Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, it wouldn't have a been difficult one to make!But due to the short time, too many characters with too many plotlines, this becomes a convoluted mess that tries to solely depend upon the cgi to impress the audience. But MCU was never about that! The best aspect about that is, we felt what the characters went through. Iron man, Captain America, Thor, we see their development slowly, we relate to them in a way that when they fight together at the end, we know exactly why they're doing that. Eternals fails in every way possible for it to fail as a MCU movie.People who are rating it above 3 stars, I think you have never seen a MCU movie and I request you to go watch it. As for Marvel authorities who greenlit this project, if your intentions are to make poor end products with the sole intention of cash grabbing, please go ahead. You will lose more fans like me."
1949,3,"wtf- 😀 I was expecting WAYY more from the eternals, but all i got was: 2 hours of family talking, 20 minutes of bad fighting and the rest is just...i am not happy if the results, but i hope it's going to be import in future of phase 4."
1950,8,"Good change This was a slightly more adult Marvel movie with different pacing and not as obvious heroes and villains. I thought it was a great spin. It did not follow the comics at all, but was still very entertaining. It seems like all of the complaints boil down to how it wasn't just mindless action the whole time. Great acting and CGI with a new group of super people! It's also cool that they're bringing in the celestials now."
1951,9,"Balances exposition and action Given the need to make a single movie which introduces a whole new part of the existing Marvel comics into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film did a good job of balancing exposition and action sequences. I liked that the exposition wasn't entirely front-loaded.You can definitely see the stamp of Zaho's style - the slow introduction of each character reminded me of the gentle pace of Nomadland.The awkward parts of the script seemed to come from the need to tie into whatever Marvel films are coming next."
1952,8,"Worth a Watch Not sure why there is so much hate against the film and glad I ignored the critics and watched it in a theatre . Maybe runtime could have been kept less, however the movie had a good story and liked the twists going forward making us realise that the earth 's vulnerability to attack is on a much larger scale than Thanos of which the Avengers have no clue about."
1953,1,An awful movie. Worst of 2021 I walked out of the cinema with full disappointment. Such a boring movie. Worst marvel movie ever. It's a complete waste of money and time. Don't recommend. Better use the time to watch Netflix at home.
1954,6,"It is one of the movies that is better to watch on streaming platforms... I like the movies from the Marvel universe, however it was the movies I liked the least for the type of characters and the story itself. I don't see it as bad because it wasn't at all, but I think I've seen better Marvel characters' movies. It's a film that essentially excels for its good special effects. It is one of the movies that is better to watch on streaming platforms than going to the cinema."
1955,3,"Didn't like it I was very excited for this movie and the trailer was very promising. I'm not a big fan of superhero movies like the other Marvel movies. But I like fantasy and magic, so I thought that I would like this movie. I left the cinema very disappointed. I did not like it at all and almost felt asleep."
1956,5,"Mediocre is the definition of this movie I went to the cinema free from other comments, I stayed away from reviews and critiques and come out from the section disappointed. It's a mediocre movie, the characters have one door charisma and their personality is all based on stereotypes (the righteous, the warrior, the envious, the rebel), and is it, nothing more. During all the movie I was questioning myself ""Why do they keep on earth after killing all the creatures? Just to get attached to humans?"" or ""Why did the celestial being bother to tell her all the lies he always hid three days before the awakening? Why didn't he just take them away and erase the memories?"", the script is full of poorly explained things and the conveniences... just lazy. Not even the fight scenes are satisfying, just regular. The sad scenes are shameful for being so badly acted. Script, characters and mediocre development."
1957,6,"Should have been a series There's a lot to like about Eternals but it's main problem is it tries to cram so much in its runtime that it ultimately suffers with pacing, characterization, plot and doesn't allow it's main themes to breathe.Undoubtedly beautiful to look at with some absolutely stunning visuals, it also suffers from the lack of a main villain and a pretty nonsensical plot that is so full of holes both within this film and the larger MCU.The premise that the Eternals can't interfere with human conflict unless the Deviants are involved is the main reason they didn't help with the ""Snap"" 5 years earlier. This makes zero sense in the overall scheme of the Celestials as half the humans on earth were wiped out. If the whole point is to bring Earth to a larger population why would you stand by and allow half of them to be wiped out? Indeed, the very reason the Eternals were created were to wipe out the Deviants as they kept killing the population of planets. The very thought that you'd let somebody else wipe out half a planet (not to mention the universe) and do nothing when you potentially have the means to stop it is pretty hard to believe.There is also the problem of these Eternals not actually being that impressive in the power levels either. Such has been the growth of the Avengers (Scarlett Witch, Thor, Hulk, Strange) I'm not sure any of the Eternals would last that long against those 4 apart from perhaps Druig.I can't help but think this would have been better served as a MCU streaming series on Disney+. There's too many characters to truly invest in and the ones they try to force on you (looking at you Madden and Chan) have zero chemistry because you just don't see enough of them together. What's worse, other pairings within the group are far more poignant and emotional with far less screen time (Jolie absolutely steals every scene she is in).There's a lot of interesting ideas and a lot of complicated questions that it asks that scream out to be allowed more time to debate. The split in the 3rd act between the Eternals would be much more impactful if we actually cared about these characters. But when you haven't seen half the team for 2/3rds of the film, the idea of this family splitting loses a lot of its impact.Overall it's an average entry, saved by Jolie's performance and some genuinely awesome battle scenes, outstanding visuals and some interesting dynamics between characters that the film unfortunately doesn't explore. The ending has major ramifications for the wider MCU and the normal teaser for a future MCU entry in Black Knight/Blade (although why Kit Harrington is even in this is beyond comprehension).Overall a disappointment."
1958,4,"Unexpected from marvel In beginning movie was on the line after the time but then it was boring the movie was but a confusing marvel could do better .In the ending you might get confused and what were basically upto .It was even hard to understand who was villain in the movie . The character of kingo was nice and other characters we to confusing one. One time watch , better expectations from marvel."
1959,6,"Could be better Movie was good but ending was unsatisfying, if you can wait for it air on Disney plus then you should otherwise it's a one time watch. Casting was good but I am angry for marvel as they left out Kingo in the final fight."
1960,6,"Not profound enough. Very pretentious I thought this movie was going to be more intelligent than the last films. However, I was disappointed. The storyline is very simple and to be honest, it's been done 1000x before. There is no shock value and the movie plays it a little bit too safe. The actors give it all they have, but even the small funny parts aren't enough to change my mind about this film. Wait until this comes on Disney Plus."
1961,9,"It's better than the critic I don't know what people and fans want about this movie. This movie is very good for me. The story is different from any other marvel movies🙏 I love makari and druid, they have the good characters and super powers."
1962,2,"Expected more from a marvel movie The story was honestly boring and makes no sense, too many people with superpowers, too much going on at once, it's more of a chick flick than a action movie, which there is nothing wrong having alot of emotions is action movie but the emotions on this movie is meaningless and unnecessary, it's honestly more like a Halloween movie when people come out to showcase their costumes in general the movie sucks."
1963,7,"Not too bad... But not too good either It definitely have some good parts. I don't like how they focus on Sersi's and Ikaris relationship too much. But the end credit scene was truly amazing. Never would've thought of someone like him to join the mcu. Overall, a great film but not one of those film I would find myself watching again and again."
1964,10,"A Really Well-Thought Out MCU Film I don't understand the hate on this film. I came in to the theater to watch this two times and loved it.Even though it's not the GREATEST film ever made, I loved this film because it was different from the others under the MCU banner. Chloe Zhao did a tremendous job directing this film. The plot was very simple and I really liked the transitions between the present day and flashbacks of when the Eternals were starting. This film is more adult oriented because we see Ikarus and Sersei doing the nasty (show me the nasty, I don't care!). Phastos was a standout and I loved Kingo. I loved the chemistry between all of the characters. Richard Madden was amazing as Ikarus, the way he twists it around in the 3rd act when he turns against his team/family really got me. And also when he was trying to kill Sersei, he couldn't, because he still loves her and didn't want to fight his team and also that he still believes in the blueprint of the universe which causes himself to commit suicide by flying to the sun in full force.I really enjoyed the relationship between Sersei and Dane Whitman aka Black Knight in the comics. And I loved Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie in this film. But the ones who standout to me was Makkari and Druig. Makkari is a badass speedster, and the visuals was amazing on her power. Druig was amazing and he would've taken over the entire world in an instant with that insane power of his. I loved the banter and chemistry between the both of them. I definitely ""ship"" these two characters.There wasn't that much action scenes in this film, and to be honest, I didn't bother me. The action was great, but you don't need a lot of action in a superhero movie as long as the story holds up and the characters serve the purpose of the story. That's all I care about seeing a good movie. A great story and amazing characters that I'll love. And boy, this movie delivered that. At my second viewing, my best friend complained that there wasn't enough action and that it dragged a couple times. I totally disagree but that's his opinion. Film is subjective.But I do have one gripe about Eternals, and it's the Deviants. It felt like they were only there to put some conflict into the story. I thought Ikarus as the twist would have made the movie better without the Deviants. But Arishem the Judge, one of the Celestials of the Universe, is no joke! When we see Arishem in the sky by the people's view on Earth, I sunk onto my chair. It made me realize that everything that had happened on Earth (i.e. Thanos, Ultron, etc.) were just small events. Arishem the Judge is the new big bad in this new phase of the MCU. He decides to either Earth is worthy enough stay afloat in the universe the Celestials created. How are our heroes gonna stop him?! He takes Sersei, Phastos, and Kingo while Dan Whitman decides to wield the Ebony Sword and Mahershala Ali's voice is heard, talking to Dane. That means the Daywalker is coming, Blade himself! I think Kit Harrington is gonna appear in the Blade movie. And Starfox aka Aros, Thanos' brother played by Harry Styles (can't wait to see him in future movies) meets up with Thena, Druig and Makkari and tells them that the others are in trouble and that he knows where they are. And Pip the Troll (with horrible 2005 looking CGI) voiced by Patton Oswalt! Can't wait to see him more but with better CGI.Overall, I give MCU's Eternals a 10/10."
1965,6,"Unfortunately generic I was in hype for this movie because Chloé Zhao was directing it. I didn't particularly love her Nomadland as far as a general movie but I was blown away by the direction and the cinematography and I was really curious to see what she could have done with a Marvel movie. Unfortunately her touch is hardly found in Eternals. Yes there are some instances in which it can be seen and they are gorgeous but for the most part I felt like the movie could have been directed by a whatever decent director that the result would have been the same and so I was a little disappointed. But this problem is only mine, linked to my expectations. The real issue with the movie is that it tries to tell too much in a much shorter time than needed and the result is pretty superficial and generic. At least it isn't boring even if lengthy and this allows to watch it without wanting to stop but it gave me nothing and I think it is hardly rewatchable. What a pity since this movie had a lot of potential even in the themes that are interesting but only mentioned and not explored, a real wasted opportunity. Hope that Marvel recovers quickly from this latest bad streak."
1966,1,"Boring as Hell Don't watch, waste of time movie..never seen a bad Marvel Movie. Wasted 200 rupees.. total boring nothing to watch felt like was watching an animated movie in which anything can happen...it sucks."
1967,7,"Interesting The movie overall was pretty entertaining. I loved the soundtracks and the comedic parts of the film. However, I felt as if there were gaps in between the storyline and there were some really confusing scenes. But I'm still excited for the second Eternals movie!!"
1968,8,"by far the best MCU project since Endgame I had doubts to watch it in the cinema after all the bad critics. But I have to say, it was really good and I enjoyed it. The actors are great, the story makes sense and is suprising. I really enjoyed the settings. Babylon for example looked awesome. All in all a solid MCU movie!"
1969,8,A little bit disappointing but still exciting The story just like walking the rope. How could you still success and make it balance? Ten main casts is not for fun for the film makers. I think it is better to hide some characters just like Infinity War hiding Hawkeye. So that the story can concentrate on 4 or 5 roles and build strong story. I am still love this film but I think the film makers still not come up with how to emerge with previous MCU films.
1970,7,"Average I'm a little bit disappointed after watching this film. Firstly, the scenario is quite predictable, but good. It shows the team of very powerful creatures made by the most powerful creature. Sometimes their decisions are illogical. Also I like that film has humour but sometimes it's in the wrong moment. Secondly, the cast is the best part of film, they are awesome. Thirdly, the visual effects and atmosphere are amazing, it has special style of film's director.So, it's average film that only connected with MCU."
1971,1,"I wish I could rate it negative. Poor casting, from actors to director. Chloe made a superhero movie a periodic drama and Why is Salma even there if she isn't showing her boobs? Totally disappointed, Marvel is going downhill. It's better that Stan Lee died before seeing this BS."
1972,4,"The movie just didn't click for me Individually, each of the Eternals were uninspiring. As an ensemble cast, this group just didn't seemed to gel. Perhaps it's because we didn't have time to appreciate each with sufficient time like with the Avengers. Maybe the goal of telling such a grandiose story within 2-1/2 hours was just too lofty of a goal. The passage of thousands of years seemed hurried and the occasion flashbacks came across artificial.I really wanted to like this movie, but at last walked out disappointed..."
1973,5,"Hard to like There just too much going on. It explores some interesting concepts but it fails to deliver them. It has so many likeable characters but it's almost impossible to introduce all of them properly, by the end of the movie I didn't care about anyone.The fight scenes are kind of boring."
1974,10,"Beautiful story line The story line is super beautiful with sersi,Ajax, and all the other characters. I also loved how the eternals essentially were slaves in some way. I thought it was crazy how Ikaris had known all along about the emergence and how everyone accept for him and sprite had went to stop it from happening. The fight scenes were also beautifully choreographed."
1975,5,"Not awful, not good, and far from great. When your movie opens with a text crawl and that movie is not called ""Star Wars"" it immediately makes me wonder about the rest of the film's quality. Definitely not the MCU's best film, but it's not as unwatchable as I've heard many people claiming it to be. The good things first: The movie is pretty to look at, and despite the fact that these characters have very little writing to them, as immortal beings I'm invested in their plight (mostly because the cast sells the emotional weight of it well) and I'm a sucker for the ""immortality"" trope in any medium of fiction. The actors and actresses do a fairly decent job of of (mostly) making the audience believe the eternals care about each other like family (which helps, because the people who wrote this movie certainly didn't). The twist (which I won't spoil here) is probably the best piece of writing in the film. So it has that going for it? And now the bad: At the end of the day the movie presents a lot of interesting and cool ideas like: Sprite being immortal, but also pre-pubescent and unable to experience adulthood. Or Athena's mind cracking under the weight of living for so long. These are very interesting concepts the movie just doesn't have time to explore. Am I saying I need a multi-film epic about the Eternals? No, not quite, but to have just a bit more time with these characters would've been nice. Especially considering they are almost 1 dimensional from a writing standpoint. On top of that, I can say the director's style (though I'm not familiar with any of her other work) was not suited to the movie (though this has happened with other films in the MCU, so I shouldn't be surprised). And whoever wrote the film didn't provide the best material, which makes you wonder ""who is in Marvel's writing room exactly?"". I think the director and cast did the best they could in two and half hours, and that left us with an average MCU film with some cool visuals, and a few neat ideas. All in all probably should've been left in the hands of a more competent director and writing team. Despite my criticisms I probably enjoyed the film more than most people (including my wife who was next to me throughout) just because I don't need to see highbrow cinema all the time to be entertained. I don't mind a straightforward adventure movie with super-powered people and pretty visual effects. Either way, if you really want to formulate an opinion on this film I suggest going to see it for yourself. Don't listen to the blatantly paid for praise, and don't listen to the people that are simply hating because of ""wokeness"" or ""diversity"", or ""it's just a bad movie"". Go see it if it interests you, and if it doesn't that's fine too."
1976,5,"Misses the Mark from the Comics As an avid comicbook reader, this story and cast completely misses the mark. The story was mashed together with no theme and too many flashbacks/flash forwards. The cast made no sense and was Marvel the melting for the audiences stead of being try to the comicbook. Not terrible. Not great movie."
1977,7,"Exceeds Expectations I enjoyed this movie way more than I thought I would. It's definitely superior to anything else that's come out since Endgame. If you think, like I thought, that the movie would be overcrowded, it's really not. Every character brings a unique perspective, their relationships are genuine, and you sympathize with both those in the right and those in the wrong. There are some surprises, but the kind where you look back and think, ok, that makes sense. Plus the acting, cinematography, and storytelling overall are amazing."
1978,10,Cultural!!! Diverse!! Beautiful!!! And creative!!! This has so much beauty. From the many messages to the diversity and inclusiveness that it showed through out the whole film. I thought it was wonderful and I can't wait see the next movie. I am sure it will be awesome. Out of the marvel movies that I have seen this is one one of my top favorites. Just was so wonderful to see p.o.c. Including my own.
1979,1,"The worst marvel movie yet Its a long and boring movie that doesn't aport anything to the marvel universe. The story os kind of complex and in the end, you just feel you waste your time. A good cast but awful movie. Don't waste time nor money in it."
1980,8,"High-concept sci-fi, operatic drama, cosmic stakes, philosophical musings? YES! Walking out of the theater after seeing it for the first time, I was tacken aback by the way this film manages to be simultaneously grand in its scope and personal in its intrigue. It features spectacular visuals with a distinctly elegant style fitting of its cosmic stakes and mythological inspiration. It includes artful composition even in its more mundane scenes. It explores what it means to be human, and it explores its decidedly alien protagonists' humanity while remaining engaging the whole time. It grapples with philosophy and morality more deeply and with more nuance than could possibly be expected of a franchise blockbuster, and it does so without dumbing down any of it. It includes large-ensemble interpersonal drama fitting of its mythical proportion, and it makes it meaningful even while introducing all its characters for the first time. It imparts in its characters a shocking degree of depth and relatability through both acting and writing; I teared up multiple times in the theater, which is very unusual for me. It pushes forward diversity in casting and characterization while always remaining natural and never feeling pander-ey. This was easily a 9-star film on first viewing.After going in blind and coming out wowed, I checked out some reviews. Whew. Apparently other people don't like this movie. Some criticisms were valid, notably the seeming irrelevance of the monstrous villains and the cutting off of the thematic qestions they pose. Others were less clear to me. People have complained quite a bit about the pacing of this film, but on first viewing, I really din't notice any issues there. A lot of the bad reviews for this movie, though, seemed to be centered around the idea that it failed to adequately develop its large cast of characters, leading to a lack of personal investment. That, I simple don't see. Every character in this film is fully formed, fully develped, and fully engaging, maybe even to a fault. When you have to introduce and develop such a large ensemble cast, you're bound to need quite a bit of backstory and a whole lot of talking. I imagine this is where some of the pacing complaints came from.Having seen the mixed reviews, I decided to see it again before fully forming my opinion. It was entirely possible I was just blinded by the novelty and missed some flaws, so going back with those criticisms in mind could've changed my view on some things. For the most part, I found that not to be the case. This really is a very, very good film. Again, I got chills multiple times, and again, I teared up multiple times. The VFX were no less stunning, and the shot composition remained world-class. At one point, I started anticipating that I might get bored being re-exposited, but it didn't happen; the character drama was so engaging that even the standing-around-talking scenes drew me in despite already knowing the factual information they were presenting. I did notice one thing on second viewing, though, that knocked it down from 9 to 8 stars for me: Dramatic developments late in the story significantly re-align the nature of many of the characters' interactions earlier on, and while this sometimes resulted in crisp foreshadowing, more often than not, it felt like a mostly missed opportunity. Still, this film holds up under strutiny, and I imagine it will only grow in popularity with time, as it no longer has to bear the burden of introducing new characters and its depth comes into better focus."
1981,6,"Too Long without any Character Development Bold move putting together a 2 and a half hour movie about a bunch of characters that are brand new to the MCU. I felt like this was an attempt to pack a whole bunch of backstory into this film, but it lacked any sort of character development. Why would we care about these guys? Hopefully this leads to something interesting down the line."
1982,1,"Personal Openion review. This is definitely my worst marvel move ever,really disappointed in marvel as a fan. Been watching marvel movie and have always loved their movies but watching this movie feels nothing like other marvel movies because,it's totally focusing on all other things that make it so not good as any of the marvel movies instead on good action and exciting scenes. To be honest the LGBT stuffs feels kind of political and marvel should defenetly focus on solely making a good movie next time."
1983,10,"bro If u didn't like this movie you're just wrong. The acting was amazing, the actors and actresses we're hot and the plot was very well paced. One of my favorite things is ikaris' betrayal and his death thank god. Really a fresh type of action movie that i hope will continue to steer clear in the sequels of the repetitiveness of many superhero movies."
1984,1,"A failed attempt I was so excited when I knew the cast.. but in the movie I only see an attempt to achieve the new Oscars agenda, Marvel wanted to try in this movie, there were many interjecting things and the attempt completely failed. The movie didn't add anything and it was completely blank."
1985,3,Eternity I was literally hoping the world was going to end during this. If you like dialog this movie is for you. They needed eternity to explain everything. This movie is brutal. If you get to see this for free do yourself a favor and stay home.
1986,6,"Magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters Chloé Zhao's direction gives Marvel Cinematic Universe a much needed breath of fresh air, but 'Eternals' doesn't quite come together. Despite the fact the film claims to have a far more thought-provoking theme and a plethora of philosophical concepts, it fails to elaborate on them sufficiently to create a more compelling experience. The movie is still magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters."
1987,7,"Review / Reflections on the film ""Eternals"". (I will immediately apologize for some mistakes, I do not know English well, I wrote the text through a translator.)Well, well, well.... Eternals.) I liked the movie for the most part rather than the other way around. He is far from being a genius, as it was said, but he is not bad either, average, and there is nothing such ""supernatural"" in him.But I have accumulated enough criticism.The characters, in some scenes, even gave them distinctive features so that they did not merge together, into a solid gray mass from their nondescriptness.About acting, again, in some scenes everything looks too implausible. Or do Marvel want to say that, with all sorts of flying aliens in the world of the cinematic universe, nobody will surprise anyone?) The point is to take the same Jolie or Hayek, if they are just trees, and nothing more ?! Remember the moments when she entered the ""berserk"" mode and actually when she left it, everything is so simple, everything is so unrealistic, no worries and internal torments, no normally realized drama! Actually, because of such moments, the dramatic component suffered in the film. And the moment with Hiroshima and Fastos? This happened very quickly, a person is such a creature, he needs time to understand, to realize! And in the film, they should lead to some dramatic moment! This happened very quickly, a person is such a creature, he needs time to understand, to realize! And in the film, they should lead to some dramatic moment! So that a person has time to be saturated with emotions! Well, here they tell you that Fastos has already lost hope in people, and in an instant we are transported into the past 70 years ago and the consequences of the bombing of Japan are shown, and we see a black man crying! THIS DOESN'T WORK!Well, at least someone, at least someone was saturated with this moment??? And literally half a minute passes as we are already back in the present. It is unnecessary to go far, remember at least the moment with the death of Uncle Ben in the Raimi trilogy!!! Yes, I cry every time on this stage! And when Ben in the car says the same words to Peter! There is no soul in these scenes that show the dramatic side of the Eternals. It doesn't work.And you can also recall Druig's words that Ayak does not understand what is happening with the psyche or the brain for 5 thousand years (I don't remember exactly how he said) and his words simply cease to be important and somehow dramatic in relation to other dramatic events.Only Jolie was blown off the roof because of some kind of ""mistake"", and the rest are cool!Kingo, who in the original source was a samurai, (well, okay) and his butler brought at least some liveliness to the film! And plus what no humor.The sprite, which is in the male canon, I did not like, the most common unremarkable one. Well, she let illusions, well, silly ridiculous things, as Gelgamesh said, and he will be right, ""childishness"", and frankly, this is never funny.Ikaris....very flat, rotten, absolutely. There were jokes that he was the new Marvel Superman, but in what he really resembles him the most, no, not by flights and lakes from his eyes, but by his woodiness. Well, after all, it's really just uninteresting and that's it! (And even Superman is a much more versatile character in this regard) Druig initially, as in the comics, had to be such a self, an ""asshole"" in the team of good guys, well, during the time that he was given in the film, from the point of view of his character, he showed, in principle, everything that was needed.There are a lot of characters, but at the same time, these heroes are not interesting in order to give them more timekeeping, so there was enough time for their origin. One of the longest running MCU films after all.The film is not that ""boring"", it is rather unhurried at the beginning and somewhere in the middle, since it was necessary to tell at least a minimal background of the Eternals and what they are in general.But also, it is quite burdensome to watch what is happening, since, where is the plot ??! Where is the plot??!He is limited only by the fact that: ""he goes here, she goes there, oh, events in the past, a fight, again he goes here, and he flies over there"", and only by the middle of the film, and it was necessary to wait a whole hour, we we learn that the whole plot is that the Eternals should not let the celestial awaken, and that's it !!!But going back to the slow pace of the film, I have an analogy with the disgusting Fantastic Four of 2015.Of course, in the case of the Eternals, in the film everything looks richer and more dignified, looks tolerant.And when everyone already understands that Ikaris is a traitor, which is strange, because this never happened in the original, although it seems to me that the plot is extremely original, but after his betrayal, the most interesting begins. And this again, you need to sit and wait for more than an hour.I also liked Makkari's reaction to Druig's ""death"".I liked the high-speed scenes with Makkari, it was beautiful.And Ikaris versus Sersi was really emotional. The only dramatic moment that worked.Suicide of Ikaris?? Seriously?? Why?? Was this character really unnecessary for them ... Eternal, and which of you can be blinded further? Who to make the film about?! 😂 Yes, and in the comics it was like that, ""The Eternals"" seem to exist somewhere else, but why was the main cast so brutally raped ??!Gelgamesh minus, Ikaris pancake, minus, Ayak minus, Sprite, most likely also minus.What else, in principle, the final scene against each other is good! Although, of course, I expected more! After all, the topic of a planetary scale goes, but no .... Sersi and Mantis are apparently very good friends, as they know how to lull huge giants, or even entire planets!But watching the WHOLE film just for the sake of this one scene ... where there is finally a heat of passion that is interesting to watch ... I don't know.As for the main villains of the film, they are, there are three of them, and they are all very ambiguous.But, I would still say that they are poorly disclosed, and their potential was used irresponsibly.But the film is not bad, in vain, it was in vain that they belittled him so much, but he would not say that he is drawn to the Oscar, as Feige wanted. Although, the devil only knows, maybe now an Oscar is being awarded for this.Interestingly, and for the mention of Alfred, Batman and Superman Marvel nothing will fly over the head there? How does it work in general?? 😂The film is average, not bad, not a masterpiece, but definitely something new for Marvel. At least the picture is not soap, because most of the scenes were filmed on location!Finally, the MCUs have done something more serious!I think that below the seven, he should not rate it.In principle, I liked the film, but not so much that I am delighted."
1988,1,"To put it shortly - It's awful No character development, no real plot, fight sequences are a fuzzy bore with no real thrill to them and overall the movie just feels like a crappy fan serviece intended solely for Marvel fanboys. It's really bad. Don't watch it unless you want to either mock it or suffer."
1989,3,"It's the Waterworld of superhero movies How did this get made?!All the actors looked bored out of their minds throughout the entire movie.The story was super boring. By tomorrow, I will have forgotten most of the details.The villain wasn't interesting, and was barely present.While the effects were obviously expensive, the overused glowing yellow effect often looked more like an ad for a video game a few years ago than like a real movie.If you want to see if this movie is worse than the 2019 Cats, or.2004's Catwoman, or Battlefield Earth, cool, you will see it is a strong competitor for a Razzie award. But if you're looking for a great superhero movie, be afraid, be very afraid. I would watch the movie of The Last Airbender again, twice, before I would want to see this again. I wish I was kidding, but I'm not!"
1990,3,"Liberal crap This movie was ruined by it worried about being politically correct. On top of that, the director jumped all over the place and felt directionless. Anyways I wouldn't see this crap in theaters worth maybe one watch. It almost should have been a comedy but every time it got funny they decided to cut that down ASAP. Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Does every movie have gay characters?"
1991,4,"Horrible. Full of long scenes that have nothing to do with the plot. HUGE waste of time. A scatter-brained plot. Most of the scenes in the movie have nothing to do with the story line, and of course they had to throw in a chunk of wokeness..."
1992,6,"Not what I had hoped... Overall, the movie looks beautiful and was easy to watch, given its long timeline. However, there are a few issues I had:1. Where was every other marvel hero? This could've been a world ending event but no Captain Marvel, Thor, Dr Strange, etc...2. I'm of the option no marvel movie needs a sex scene. It's still a Disney/marvel product but more import It didn't move the story along.3. Much like the sex scene, I could do without most romantic pairing in marvels movies. The gay couple felt like pandering. The other couple, aside from the main love story, felt completely unnecessary. Only the main couple had a story that was actually central to the plot. Everything else felt super forced and kind of pointless."
1993,4,"Worst MCU Movie Yet Pretty disappointing. One thing that has made the marvel movies so good is that each character was a different, separately explored character. Eternals tries to make the audience care about 10 separate characters in one single movie. Because of this, much of the movie is spent on exposition and dialogue. Somehow though, none of the characters feel like developed characters by the final act and you're left with a movie with no interesting action, adventure, story, and characters. Some of the things they do just makes no sense either, they will just switch up their entire motives for no reason and it makes no sense. I could not tell you a single memorable character in the entire movie and the fact that we are gonna see them in other marvel movies makes me lose hope for future team up movies."
1994,8,Slow but good mcu entry This movie has had a lot of criticism for being the worst movie in the mcu. So I went to the cinema to see it for myself. And i can say that I actually enjoyed it. The film does start off at a slow pace but the further into the story the faster the pace of the film. Most of the characters were likeable and some were straight boring.Overall its a decent mcu movie.
1995,9,"see it for yourself Here's my rant on why eternals is definitely one of the best marvel movies ever put out. This film isn't your typical superhero flick, it presents deep, moving and philosophical questions that leave you guessing after you leave the theatre.The movie touches on themes of humanity, forgiveness, family, and most importantly - what it means to love. Matched with excellent cinematography and a brilliant score by ramin djawadi, it was both a visual and sonic feast.One of the best aspects in marvel's eternals is that it allows for characters to share differing opinions on grand debates without it feeling forced or unearned. Throughout the entire film, characters debate morals and ethics while mostly avoiding hostility. It's beautiful.Possibly my favourite dynamic in the movie revolves around thena and gilgamesh. The feeling of safety and protection between the two of them, without a strain of co-dependency is a fresh and necessary take that i felt worked perfectly in the film.Side note - using thena as an example of the horrors that can affect a person through post traumatic stress was a thing of beauty. Witnessing angelina jolie in her moments of vulnerability as thena was heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. I loved this film so much.Finally, i'd like to personally thank marvel studios for finally reuniting my stark brothers for the first time in nearly a decade. My heart skipped a beat when ikaris and dane whitman met on-screen. As always, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives."
1996,5,"Quite disappointing I'm sad to say that this has to be one of the worst Marvel movies in recent time. The premise has promise but the execution and the characters fall flat. And don't even get me started on the fluctuating powerlevels of the Eternals... Overall it's a hot mess. Kind of feels like a Power Rangers movie, with a bigger budget.There are some good points when it comes to music and CGI but that's about it. Thankfully they atleast managed to check most of their political boxes...."
1997,5,Eternals Story doesn't make sense. The characters in the movie don't have much chemistry. The ending is unsatisfactory and very unrealistic. It's a nice movie for the couch but not worth the money to see in the cinema.
1998,1,"AWFUL Just awful. Don't see it. Waste of time. Everything MCU has been doing in film lately has been crap. Stupid monsters, stupid characters, absolutely idiotic plot. Don't waste your time. Or do, and hopefully have the same opinions as me. Did I mention it was awful?"
1999,9,"What a wonderful movie of heroism and passion Chloe Zhao is very well known for her art house film ""Nomadland"" and I was star-struck when I heard she was directing a MCU film. When the initial reviews came out, a lot of people bounced this movie like frying eggs in a pan filled with mixed reviews and people walking out for being too boring.Honestly, my initial thoughts for this film were not on par with critics. I was curious to see the anticipation for this movie based on the reviews for this movie. I was Blown away!The reasons are for as follows: thought provoking messages, epic battles, characterization was very unique, and the representation of LGBTQ was amazing! My only criticism is that there was a lot of stuff happening and the story bounced from A to C without B. But, that's my only criticism. The post-credit scene was an amazing finish to an amazing movie!Highly recommend this movie if your interested in the most thought provoking and emotional MCU movie so-far!"
2000,7,"An out of the Marvel usual plots and themes.. a nice movie afterall ! ETERNALS is the unusal Marvel movie you will see for sure ! Different from the whole previous marvel movies (standalone and avengers movies). The movie in general is a strong one interms of graphics, and cinematic details.. the plot has a beautiful twist that I think will change your understaning of the movie according to what you read before... WHY 7/10! Offcourse this is not a superb dramitic movie that leaves you totally shocked or completely amazed once the end hits the screen.. you will know what I mean once you fininsh watching it.. At the end, in my opinion the bad rating are somehow not fair."
2001,2,"Just awful really truly bad and boring How would I - no, why would I want to review a movie so bad that I want to give it zero stars but don't for fear that zero stars would be removed by IMDb as an anomaly. I want to explain to you how I was formulating a review in the negative within moments of the movie first starting. I won't spoil because there truly is nothing to spoil - standard god movie where indestructible beings are somehow made to look vulnerable. Whatever. This is just another bad movie in what I am sure will be a ling line of poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, and poorly cgi manufactured crap. Do not waste a penny nor a farthing on this complete waste of time. Unexciting and unimaginable at every moment and just another reason for a movie studio to attempt to get your money. Don't go."
2002,5,"Marvel can do it much better I can't say that I don't want to see a continuation, but I was bored and disappointed in the beginning. I understand that nowadays cast and awards are often about politics, but have some mercy, fans want to see some quality stuff please. Why Legend of 10 rings was an incredibly captivating movie with an incredible actors' play and this movie couldn't be? Some actors' very quality play here saves the movie, because some other actors' play wasn't good. And after some time plot starts to be captivating, so you want to know what comes next.People speaking Spanish in Amazon rainforest instead of Portuguese just freaked me out. And I'm not Brazilian, not even close, I just speak Portuguese and understand some Spanish, so people can notice the difference, you know."
2003,1,Please Marvel .. go back in time We do t need another version of superman and flash .. we want some sense in movies !!! Slow and illogical things happened beside the weakest twist I ever seen in Marvel movies .. I think Marvel need the stones to go back in time to the days before Covid 19..
2004,5,"No real point I think the Eternals did not deserve a spot in the MCU in the first place. However, once they were announced I assumed they would fulfill the role they have in the comics, which is to set up the ""family tree"" behind superhumans, mutants, and other wildly powered races like the Skrull, Kree, and Inhumans. Marvel is also obviously trying to further develop the foundation for magic/supernatural characters, and seems to not be focusing as much on technological/scientific origins for a while. Whatever. This film fails miserably at establishing anything in terms of world-building. They seem to have come up with the idea that the ""message"" of the film should be that you can be who you want, stay true to yourself, and overcome the powers that want to keep you enslaved (but again: only if you stay true to yourself. Thanks Disney!). Even that message is muddied with conflict that cuts every which way through all levels of loyalty and obligation with no worthwhile resolution. The deus ex machina factor is off the charts, with major struggles wiped away by solutions that come from nowhere and take zero effort or sacrifice by characters we don't even care about anyway. The ""big three"" performances (Sersi, Ajak, Ikaris) were wooden and unlikeable, and the ""supporting"" cast only got enough screen time to pique our interest. This movie tried to do too much, and didn't accomplish any of it. 5/10 for managing to keep just enough interest to want to see these characters improved in the future and introduce further potential storylines. SPOILER and huge disappointment: Sprite should have had a much bigger hand in the machinations behind the plot. She's 7000 years old and a bitter, unfulfilled trickster/illusionist. She should have put Loki to shame manipulating the other Eternals to her own ends, like the male version in the more contemporary storylines in the comics. The weight of immortality should be portrayed as a much greater burden than ""I hate having to move every five years.""Overall, this idea and these characters had huge potential, for deep emotional exploration as much as the fundamental superhero stuff. Should have been an absolute playground for a director like Zhao. Instead it's a muddy mess."
2005,1,"Eternals, A Marvel Tragedy! With a great line-up of skilled actors, I thought the movie was positioned for an incredible storyline. WHAT A DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE. A waste of time, I truly wanted to walk out of the Eternals movie several times, but I gave it a chance, and it failed in the end. Including the special appearance at the end, LAME! There was some exciting moments, but it was overwhelmed by the monotonous plot, the bland acting, and the lgbtq agenda. Even, the Celestials were poorly designed; an uttering creative disappointment. I'm surprised to have this experience from such an incredible past of intelligently formulated storytelling; sorry Marvel not your best work. This movie was worse than Hulk or 2003's Dare Devil. Sad day!"
2006,7,"Not that bad like what critics says For me this movie is not really that bad and not really that boring, I didn't feel boring at all I was really enjoyed the movie, but there's somethings maybe make the rating of this movie is low, like there's a lot of character died or leave the eternals or doesn't have much a screen time and the storyline was super fast to changed from present to past, past to present. Ajak screen time was very little or doesn't have much screen time, like we didn't see they work together the 10 eternals, we cannot seeing Ajak lead the team, it's only like a few minutes she work together with eternals. And the story or the plot it's kinda a bit lacking like when they're in earth they feel different how about another planet, the plot twist was kinda amaze me and I don't know who is the traitor Ikaris or the Eternals, cause Ikaris trayed Eternals and Eternals trayed Celestial. And the Intro was one of the best intro in MCU IMO cause there's a scene before an intro, it's different with other MCU movies.I think Eternals is a very new thing in MCU, new face in MCU. I never watch MCU movie like this before, it's kinda different and Chloe was very brave to show a scene that never happen in MCU, and in my opinion this is the best CGI or Visual in Marvel Cinema Universe Movie right now, the visual was really make me amaze and like this movie. I hope there's an Eternals series so we can know their back story and of course Ajak. Don't forget to watch those two credit scene cause that was super epic and I really curious who is talking to the Whitman or dane.In Indonesia there's so many cut scene I think it's 5 and 1 get blurred, and there's no kissing or sex scene in Indonesia and when Sprite give middle finger to the camera it was get blurred, I was kinda disappointed but I still enjoyed the movie. It's worth to watch cause the visual was really amazing, for me this movie is 6.5/10, can't wait to see the sequel of this movie. This movie is not really that good cause they didn't focus on the eternals story, but focused on Sersi life and love between Ikaris and sprite and Sersi."
2007,3,"Should've been a miniseries This was the worst Marvel movie I've watched in the last 10 years. I've seen and heard comments about how mature this movie is and how it focuses and develops it's characters and their relations, etcetera. I'm not sure we watched the same movie.Yes, the movie tries those things but miserably fails at them at every turn because of the horrible pacing and confusingly disconnected substories. It doesn't take a genius to figure out this story should've been a miniseries. All of the relations and character development they're trying to do, doesn't belong in a 160min movie. The movie's multiple stories were scattered all over the place and these said stories barely connect with each other, or matter at all at the end of the movie. Otherwise, I very much enjoyed watching them interact with each other but it wasn't enough and AGAIN had horrible pacing, sadly."
2008,1,"The word AWFUL is a compliment for this movie What a complete waste of time and money. Couldn't wait till it finish. The worst movie I've ever seen with no doubt. What a total waste 😤😝. If I could escape from the middle of the movie I would have done, but didn't want to disturb other people so kept fiddling with my phone."
2009,8,An enjoyable and unique marvel movie Good directing and a nice combination of cast! The story is also well written. I enjoy the movie much as it is beautifully made. Wanna want to watch the sequel soon.
2010,3,"Oh dear Absolutely awful. The only reason I rated it a 3 is because it's pretty in places. Over acting, trying to hard at humour. Walking like carpet fitters, so twee. Please don't waste your money, or time. I googled how long it was whilst I was sat there and only stayed because we paid."
2011,7,"Don't judge the film based on your expectations! I think the perfect way to watch a movie it is going without knowing anything, and form your own opinion while you're watching it.Eternals may not be the best movie of the year, nor the best movie of the MCU, but it's pretty great. It has some really interesting themes, ambiguous character, great cinematography, good use of the music. It has some flaws, like the overuse of comedy, but the film shine the most when it is below the director's eyes which is most of the run time.Maybe this movie will be more loved in the future, but for now, it's better if you form your own opinion."
2012,5,"I really wanted to love this I'm all for seeing the next instalment of the MCU, however, I was quite disappointed with this one. It wasn't the WORST film I've ever seen, but I didn't come out of the cinema thinking that its moved up to my number one spot in my favourite films list, either.I don't always agree with the critics, but I think they might be right in this regard.The pacing was patchy at best, found my mind wandering around the middle before the finale and found myself trying to keep up with all the different location and time periods that we jumped around in.That being said, I didn't feel any emotional connection to the characters at all. Some of the acting was... not good and some of the jokes/punchlines seemed SO out of place. The main love story did not fool me at all, there genuinely wasn't any chemistry between the two characters and I'm wondering if that was intentional?The character development could've been something for a TV show, there is no time to develop that many characters within such a short space of time and make us like, root for, and care about them. It's not like each character could've had a origin story because this IS the origin story, unless the sequels are about them breaking off and having their own movie, which I don't see logically.Plot wise - info dump! Instead of learning about the plot gradually throughout the film, there was an entire scene where EVERYTHING was explained to us in one go and I half expected the character to go, ""What?""Despite what I've just written, it isn't ALL bad. The Bollywood dance scene was beautiful, the outfits, the choreography and direction were great. Karun - a human, and Kingo were definitely the best characters, full of personality in this and Druig (who has the ability to take over minds), I thought, had huge potential to become an interesting character.Overall, I think this needed to be better knit, it's the same old ""good guy turns out to be the bad guy"" plotline that we've seen a hundred times. Ikaris just reminded me of a less crude Homelander - they even have the same powers.If anyone asked me if it was worth seeing, I wouldn't say to go out their way. But it does fill a couple of hours (and a half) if you're bored."
2013,9,Unique MCU movie Not an usual MCU style movie. Great shorts. Good to see director was not relying on CG too much. Great casting. Every character has unique characters and well showed. More than enough for phase 4 of MCU.
2014,6,"Predictable The hype of black knight , and 5 minute role of black knight?!The movie was very predictable, you can think what is gonna come. Although it was story build up, will wait for 2nd part.Also Angelina Jolie was a waste of character."
2015,8,"Cholé Zhao is a visionary The movie has several cinematic moments and some beautiful shots that aren't the product of a green screen. Salma Hayek however acts as if she would be doing anything else but this, and comes across as forced and mundane. It has a very different ( and welcome) tone from all other Marvel movies although some bits were a little too stretched. Definitely doesn't deserve the bad reviews."
2016,4,"Long drawn out superhero film that spans time and ages! Not the greatest ""Marvel"" movie fan yet I gave ""Eternals"" a try even though never really hearing about it or reading the comics, and was not real impressed as the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I guess a watch if your a Marvel movie fan, and the look of Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as superheroes was sexy and impressive."
2017,1,Worst movie of 2021 by marvel Frustrated during watching in cinema hall totally bored what the hell totally wastage of money.One of most disasterous movie by marvel series.. Wasted my time😞😞😞😞 Disappointed😞😞😞😞
2018,7,Well um...... Kinda wathable!! This movie is not a typical MCU film. I think this movie will make you see MCU as a different entity as a whole. I kind of liked it.. And the visuals are a real treat for the viewers. I experienced this movie in IMAX and I do not regret it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is obsessed with Super Hero stuff..
2019,7,Hodgepodge of superhero film A hodgepodge of superhero film and philosophical fantasy to expand MCU Phase IV. The plot looked scrambled but Chloe Zhao brought great 'diversity' for good purpose. Cast did such decent jobs through action sequences and visceral visuals despite limited backstories.
2020,8,"Great! The Eternals is quite different from any MCU movie, but definitely not worse. The visuals are amazing, plot is great, what would you want more? Well Eternals in my opinion needs some more action, in one part of movie our heroes are just moving around a planet to fulfill their goal. Overall really good movie, definitely must see!"
2021,9,"Great movie, much more complex than the previous phases This was a great start to phase 4. I get many marvel fans like to keep it simple, jokes every 2 minutes, pew pew pew, nobody ever dies, etc. But this movie is not that. It's much more mature, marvel learned from past mistakes and is headed towards a great phase 4.They did cram quite a lot of new characters into 1 movie, but that be forgiven.Don't listen to salty reviews, see it for yourself."
2022,9,"Enjoyable in IMAX I honestly think it was an enjoyable experience. I was a little surprised to find a lot of meh reviews here, but seems like those who watched it in IMAX all enjoyed it including myself. I agree that some of the acting scenes are suboptimal, and that there could be more emotional development between characters, but imo the storyline, the character design (diversity) and the amazing visual effects overcame the cons, and left me a good impression."
2023,4,"A movie this bad is just laziness It's shouldn't be possible to make a movie this bad. Epic cast, huge budget.... Just the worst imaginable writing. It's so bad that it cant be an accident. Why would they choose to make something this bad?"
2024,10,"Much better than critics say Let's start off by saying that this movie wasn't great, but was good. In marvel standards it failed to bring that sense of coolness we usually get, probably because there was so much going on. But, I liked the movie. Acting, cinematography, casting, cgi, special effects and general plot were all fantastic. It only missed its mark by trying to fit so many new characters into one movie. It was difficult to feel a connection to them because of this. Except for Gemma Chan's character Sersi, whom I immediately took a liking to and could connect with. She was the highlight of the film for me. Everyone saying this is the worst marvel movie isn't being dramatic. This movie was good. In my opinion, better than Thor 1 & 2, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Venom 1 & 2, Captain Marvel and Incredible Hulk. CGI was much better here than in Black Widow. I think the main disconnect for fans was the fact that none of these characters have been shown before. In all the other MCU movies and series there's been at least one appearance from a previously established character. Even in Shang-Chi, Wong had a little appearance, plus some other characters in the post-credit. None of this happened in Eternals. Overall I enjoyed the movie, would recommend watching it, think it's a good movie alone, and pretty decent in regards to other MCU content."
2025,10,"Fantastic! Loved it!! Funny, great action, and loved the cast. Family relationships felt real. I loved the flashbacks and connections to history. A lot of story but not so dragged out or complicated. Excited for the next one!"
2026,9,"Big step forward for the MCU An appreciable film, not heavy and enjoyable. It's not so easy to narrate a so deep story, they are Eternals and they go over the ""normal"" superheros that everyone knows.The plot is full of turn of events, making a film that is not at all easy."
2027,9,"Excellent, unique MCU Film I'm not sure what all the hatred is about. Are people expecting to see iron man again or something? The MCU has expanded and each film is becoming more unique.This film is visually stunning, the premise is very interesting and the cast is excellent."
2028,1,"Waste of time and waste of money Worse marvel movie till the date. Why marvel waste their money on this movie. This movie is such a pandemic . Movie was so boring, no story line character are lame action seens are not even good, in one line waste of money and waste of time, even shang chi is Better than this ,only saw this because of angilna jolie but her role was also not good so don't go for imax and waste your money."
2029,8,"A solid work I did not have high hopes going in to watch this as a social activity but I was pleasantly surprised.Pacing was spot on, plot and sideplots were engaging and done well if a bit corny, visuals were amazing and actions scenes . . . Acceptable.It didn't have an overarching revolutionary philosophy which I've often seen ruin a movie.Overall, I would recommend it for what it is - a superhero blockbuster."
2030,2,"Boring Marvel movie so far.... My 1st marvel movie that I fell asleep, it was so boring, the soundtrack were all over or not matching with the scenes, characters were lame, lacks strong presence, needs introduction in-spite of their numbers, and some similarity with one of the characters of DC, and my all time favorite - Superman, I may pass on the sequel ..."
2031,7,"It could've been perfect.. Its actually not as bad as the critics says. I watched this movie not expecting a big fight scene like avengers. I expect it to be more compassionate and to feel the strong bond between the Eternals. I expect it more like.. maybe Xmen?I do believe Chloe Zhao of all people is more than capable to do that.But no.. i dont feel their chemistry. They are know each other and potrayed as family for centuries yet it feels lack of love. I know their individuals stories will not fit in a movie but at least their stories as a group or family couldve been potrayed better. Ikaris and Sersi chemistry is supposed to be one for the books but their chemistry is so bland. Gilgamesh and Thena platonic friendship is potrayed a little better, Druig and Makkari also shouldve been more explored they have so much potential.All cast is doing their best, but im a little dissapointed with Gemma Chan. Shes not convinced me enough as someone that so kind, loving, and charming. Im not conviced that Sersi actually love either Ikaris or Dane tbh. And Sersi take when she learned the truth and finally leading the eternals is a little bit one dimensional. Its lack the dilemma and depth of Tony stark in civil war or natasha romanoff in black widow.But overall, this is a good introduction of expanded universe, a solid 7 is well deserved. Still looking forward to the next eternals."
2032,9,"Great movie, loved the theme of family & forgiveness! I really enjoyed this movie! I loved the subtle references to Avengers & other Marvel heroes, but that it was its own movie that kind of stepped aside from all that, it was uniquely its own with opportunity to connect it to a bigger picture & other characters! The diversity of the cast was soo good & greatly appreciated & the soundtrack was amazing (as usual)! The family/team aspect of the movie was incredible & it was something I was craving after feeling like the Avengers had left me hanging a bit in their most recent movies in that department, loved it!"
2033,10,Best MCU since Infinity War Finally something interesting from Marvel.Don't get me wrong... I love MCU but recently it felt a bit stale... Storytelling is just a perfect mix of subtle and bold. All of those newly introduced characters felt real. Story was familiar but had some freshness in it.Loved it and strongly recommend 😊
2034,6,Meh at best This movie was just all over the place. As are these reviews.The story was pretty ok. Decent twist.Special effects were like they had two different companies working on this. Some scenes were great. Others look like a high school class project.Some of the suspension of belief started getting out of control even for marvel movies. Also you can't tell me this situations would happen and NONE of the other major characters or organizations would get involved. Not to spoil anything but the events in this movie are pretty global and someone would've came to check it out.None of these characters do I care if I see again. Nor do i know what the major plot line is. Last phase we knew by now where this was all heading. Who the big bad was going to be. Where is this going? And more importantly do I care? Because as it stands not so much. With nothing obvious to tie these movies together you need to see them as individual films which really hurts the immersive feeling.I really hope they pick it up soon. It's becoming tough justifying paying to watch all these movies in theaters.
2035,3,"Jealous of the Guy Snoring in front of Me Wow... I've seen every Marvel movie and I really felt like the reviews in this were over-the-top negative based on external factors. But they're not. It's bad. I just wish I could've fallen asleep like the guy snoring in front of me.Hold out for the post credit scene, or just read the spoilers online. This isn't one worth following."
2036,8,"Not as bad as what critics say I truly don't understand all the hate on the movie. Not the best Marvel movie, yes, but also far from awful. Very impressive visuals with interesting characters that understandably clashed one another. Add that with the chemistry here and there among themselves. I alo love all the soundtracks that perfectly fit the whole vibe of the movie (Ramin Djawadi is amazing as usual). Eager to see how Eternals going to fit in with the whole MCU timeline and the other Avengers."
2037,1,Senless movie without logic 1 rating only for entertainment scenes of kissing otherwise this the totally time wasting movie. Disappoint.1 rating only for entertainment scenes of kissing otherwise this the totally time wasting movie.1 rating only for entertainment scenes of kissing otherwise this the totally time wasting movie.
2038,9,"Don't listen unfair reviews or radical MCU fans This might be the first time a MCU movie causes such divisive both crítics and fans, can understand that, however it's not fair reading so much hate or harshness around.In my case, this might be the case of the begging of a whole new era of MCU movies thanks to genius Chloe Zao and her miraculous look, she has an eye for others details out of marvel formula (great as always) that challenges fans and the newcomers as well by putting together, fantasy, magic, indie, diverse characters, music, nature, sunsets, lights, humor and dark twists and giving the world a brand new marvel flick!I loved the effects, the use of colors, actors of course and everything! Of course it's not the best marvel movie but this celebrate humanity, life, death, purpose s in life, diversity, history and even nature and the beauty of life, give it a try! It's awesome!"
2039,1,"Couldn't be more disappointed Disney ruined Star Wars for the same reasons, now this? They like losing money as a result, the plot was weak, the connecting scenes were dull & the action scenes were lacking in every way. This felt like a high budget show on the WB television network.Horrific."
2040,10,"A terrific film. I loved it. Exciting, adventurous, and colorful. The story is well written and interesting. And the special effects are outstanding. I loved all of the characters. I like the fact that a positive gay character is featured. It's about time."
2041,3,"Dark and Dreary and Insulting to the brand! I was excited to see this one. Sadly, that excitement ended fairly quickly! The movie is dark and ridiculous. There are plot holes. Things that should be explained once are repeatedly explained like we're all five years old and Mommy has to keep reminding us. It's just a ridiculous sidestep away from what we've come to expect from a Marvel Movie!"
2042,2,"It felt a little preachy to me I miss going to the movies and just being entertained. Everything now feels like indoctrination and shaming. I miss movies, sports, news, etc. This is long and disjointed. It felt to me like a middle school play in parts. It didn't feel like Marvel."
2043,7,Eternals: Gods Among Us I have to say I had low expectations going in but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is better than the what the critics made it out to be. It is a more somber story for sure. That would be off putting for usual MCU fans for sure. The DC references caught me off guard. Hence the title of my review. Not blatant attacks on DC like in Deadpool 2 but more subtle references. More like an homage? Very weird. The visuals are great however the movie suffers due to length and the chemistry within the actors. The chemistry is not great. Overall I enjoyed the movie.
2044,8,"Don't listen to critics and the people who's trying to make themselves look good by going with the negative media coverage this film got before release. First things first. This is not a typical MCU film. When you're going to watch this film you should know this. When the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie came in 2014 a lot of people skipped that film, called it boring, said skipping this film won't make a difference. There are bunch of new characters that they don't care about and never heard of. That's not a good film. Blah blah. 4 years later ""Avengers Infinity Wars"" came with the prime villain ""Thanos"" who was first explored in details in the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). I know Thanos first appeared in the post credits of og Avengers (2012) and later on Avengers: Age of Ultron (2014). But those films didn't really show him, his purpose and his character truly. After watching infinity war people went back and saw the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" again and they liked it. Because all these years later, they know those characters and they're emotionally connected to them. So they understood its purpose.Well, kinda similar stuff is happening in Eternals. People don't know these characters. This is their first appearance in the MCU. And there are a lot of character development to cover in one film. The story was not bad. Obviously the story is not complete in this film. This movie is there just to introduce you to those characters. This is a huge universe with a lot of characters. So it's essential to let you know about every individual so that whenever they appear in a blockbuster film you don't get to say what the hell? Who's this? How's he doing the stuffs he's doing here.This movie is not supposed to have a avengers level threat. Matter of fact it still had a huge threat that they dealt with which might not be that much important to you for the time being. Because this type of threat was never shown in this way in MCU before.Think of Spider-Man: Homcoming, that film was to introduce you to the MCU Spider-Man. He's a child, he behaves like child even during serious fight. That movie wasn't supposed to have a ""Thanos"" level villain. That was supposed to have a small low profile villain. Which it had. But you liked it. Why? Because you already know Spider-Man for decades now. And Spider-Man in MCU was bigger news than the movie itself. Well, Eternals are new (not really but newly introduced) to this universe.In my opinion the movie was played at just the right speed to make you accustomed to each and every single new characters. And then show you the real purpose of those characters, then go to an ending which is actually a new beginning. May be some years later you'll find a new villain who was first portrayed in this film to become the next big one. Honestly, this film is all about character development. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. They just became part of a universe which is already big enough. They needed an entry point. This film is the entry point. They'll play a bigger role in the next ones. And trust me, that time you will be loving it, 'cause it'll be direct Marvel action and you already knew them. Overall, I really like the film. Is it the best film marvel ever made? No. Is the worst? Absolutely not.If you want to go to the theatre expecting you're gonna see some serious marvel action, you're obviously gonna be disappointed. 'Cause you must know before going that this film is not made for that. It's your introduction to Eternals. The bill comes due.My Rating: (7.5-8)/10Don't listen to critics and the people who's trying to make themselves look good by going with the negative media coverage this film got before release. This is not at all a bad film at all. It's just it's different. It's supposed to be different.If you think character development doesn't worth your time, then don't go for it. I saw 4-5 people sitting beside me who left the theater halfway through the film because it seemed unworthy of their time. And I completely understand that. You can skip as well if it's not your thing. Before their next appearance, you can literally search on YouTube ""Superpowers of Eternals"" and I'm sure there'll be some videos to explain that to you in 5-10 mins. But if you wanna discover them yourself go for it. Don't listen to others. Be the judge yourself.Thank you for reading this far. Hopefully I was able to clarify my thoughts to you."
2045,4,"that was not it Boring, bad acting, weak storyline, no dramatic highlights, much too long ..it's a total mess. I hope there will be no part 2 of this.Probably the worst marvel so far."
2046,2,"I've watched bad things but this... I've watched bad things but this is horrible. Bad script, bad plot, deplorable acting and sometimes decent CGI and good scenarios. 1.5 for the scenarios and 0.5 for the cgi. The entire movie is a plot hole."
2047,6,"Meh? It gave me the feeling that they made it in a way to just be done with and get to the next project. The story is amazing and has so much potential for future, but some parts of the story didn't make any sense to be over looked at so quickly. I don't know why the CGI got so much hate because except the post credit part that had an awful CGI scene, most of the film was decent. The music was amazing and the production of the movies was overall between 7 or 8 out of 10 for me (quality wise). I felt like they could have divided this movie into two parts(?)."
2048,9,"Uniquely Epic! Eternals is a wonderful movie. I'm baffled as to why there are so many negative reviews. Anything less than 6/10 is just absurd, and quite frankly, should not be taken seriously. In a way that I can't quite describe right now, it has somewhat of different, fresh vibe to it versus other MCU films. It seems classier, in a sense. The film is solid, and has nothing to prove to anyone. If you didn't like it, that's on you. I loved it. I want to see the sequel, like, now!"
2049,7,"Chloé Zhao just killed it... Might just be the worst Marvel movie ever...Is it beautiful... yes its a beautiful made movie with a lot of fake CGI that make the Battle of the 5 Armies with Legolas look jumping in mid air look amazing, but the creatures in this movie is nothing less than horofic and really bad made.The story or plot in this etarnals movie... omg its bad... it like watching a hungry man chewing of his own arm to get away from the cinema bad.How could Marvel and Kevin F get this one so wrong like they did?This Phase 5 just started and ended in the same movie, because its bad.RIP Marvel."
2050,1,"Yeah, just one outta ten because I was really disappointed... I have created a lot of expectations after Endgame.. the Disney + Series were quite well from WandaVision to ""What If"", Black Widow was a disaster in my opinion, I was willing for a tribute or maybe an origin story of how Natasha met Hawkeye and exactly joined Nick and SHIELD properly, Shang-Chi I enjoyed but whatever, the Topic is about Eternals...Straight to the point... it's too long, I almost slept in many many parts and imagine that the last time I've watched a very long movie (Infinity War and Endgame) I barely blink, well that's definitely not the case in Eternals...I found the script pretty confusing, suddenly going back in time and present day, and again, definitely too long, lots of unnecessary takes, scenes... they tried to somehow introduce the characters but to be honest I simply didn't developed any empathy with anyone at all... I simply didn't mind the ones that have died, Ikaris throwing himself into the Sun, Sersi and the other one disappearing etc I simply didn't develop any good feelings through this almost 03hrs movie...I understand it's supposed to be a new phase in MCU, a new page but in my opinion everything that is shown in this movie totally erases what have happened so far! They simply torn the old pages a part!The Eternals shouldn't interfere but along the whole mankind history they intervene from time to time, saving people, watering the dry land, avoiding wars caring about people when it's convenient etc But they simply watched the ""Blip"" and did nothing because after all their ""business was to deal with the Deviants instead of dealing with a human being but them again later on they do care about people on Earth and families and love etc what da hell!!??Btw it seems that the ""Blip"" was the right stuff to do and the Avengers were the ones interfering and cursing the whole mankind with Ironman' sacrifice, afterall, at least by what is shown in Eternals, the Celestials ""hatching"" the planet happens because of super population, so Thanos was right wiping out half universe so he avoid various Celestials to hatch and the Avengers did wrong!? All that happened back from first Ironman in 2008 to Endgame in 2017 was in vain afterall!? What a shame! How come!!???Really, for me was a totally waste of time and money... was expecting something much much better... definitely deserves ZERO stars!"
2051,9,"Very surprising! Based on rotten tomatoes and all the reviews I saw, I thought this was going to be terrible since it was Marvel's lowest rated movie. Boy was I wrong. It delivered and I cried at the end. Can't wait for Eternals 2!"
2052,10,"This is my first review! I get the hate, white people hate to be left out. Straight people hate when they are not represented. Racism and homophobia will live forever I think but movies like this, spit in the face of every sad sack who comes to hate! This is the largest, cosmic sci-fi movie ever made and it's truly inspiring! It's okay to not like it because your brain is too small to take in all its glory. But for this non comic reading, Marvel fan, this was a SUPER HIT! As my friend next to me cried, my other friend who is NEVER impressed, gasped multiple times, I found myself overwhelmed with this films scale! It's awesome! Lots of emotion, killer fight scenes, great performances and an amazing storyline, this film is a solid 10! Anything I didn't like, could drop this film to a 9.5 but well worth the 18$ ticket!"
2053,9,"Amazing Movie. Amazing movie. My 13 years old daughter was impressed by the theme of the movie. It is not just an action movie.Solid performance, every single actor. Fair time for every character.Really enjoyed. Will pay to watch again."
2054,1,Watch on Disney+ Honestly felt trapped in the cinema. If I wasn't with people I would have walked out. I would rather watch Thor 2 on a loop for 24 hours than watch this film again.
2055,10,"Enjoyable MCU movie! I watched the movie with a lower expectations after reading some mixed reviews. I'm suprised that this is just like another typical MCU movie, very entertaining.Also, got to watch Angelina Jolie as a superhero is satisfying!"
2056,4,"Slow, long, woke, boring, actor's going through the motions. No point giving it a review just like the film.& now we have a massive celestial permanently sticking out of the planet.Seriously disappointing.This makes Thor dark world look like a master piece.Now im just filling up the 150 characters needed to post, boring huh but not as boring as Eternals. I hear the new Rocky IV is being released, can't wait."
2057,4,"Marvel's DC Multiverse This film was not very good for multiple reasons. First of all, I feel like Marvel is just trying to create cash bag money making heroes that aren't original, but ARE gonna sell well. The heroes in this film are literally just Marvel ripping off various heroes from DC and trying to make it their own, but failing.This film was also incredibly forgettable. I saw it about 4 or 5 days ago and I can barely remember anything that happened. This is due to the forgettability of the plot, characters, questionable special effects, and everything in between.I did find it entertaining in the beginning because I was expecting a mindless Marvel movie with a ton of action and not much plot, which got me excited because, usually, Marvel movies don't have the best writing. But, after the first couple battles, they stopped the action for a large chunk of the film, putting it to a halt.I don't hate this film, but I do find it way too long and incredibly forgettable and a film that, in a week from now, I will forget that I ever saw it."
2058,5,"This is worth watching and has some redeeming elements but is up there with Captain Marvel as one of the worst films from the Marvel universe in some time Eternals (2021) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres its opening weekend. The movie tells the tale of Eternal beings sent to Earth to protect it from entities known as deviants. Once they rid the world of deviants they live relatively normal lives among the humans who are now able to flourish. However, when deviants return to the Earth's surface the Eternals will need to get back together to protect humanity and uncover why they've returned.This movie is directed by Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) and stars Gemma Chan (Crazy Rich Asian), Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider), Salma Hayek (Dusk till Dawn), Richard Madden (Game of Thrones), Kit Harington (Game of Thrones), Kumail Nanjiani (Stuber), Brian Tyree Henry (Hotel Artemis), Barry Keoghan (The Green Knight) and Bill Skarsgård (IT).This was an extremely uneven movie. There are so many unique characters, elements and worthwhile conversations and topics. The CGI and action sequences are crisp and well done and the villain(s) are solid. There are also aspects of the storyline that dragged, characters that were painfully ripped off from the DC universe and decision made by key characters that make you slap your head and didn't feel realistic with the wisdom and perspectives of the Eternals.Overall this is worth watching and has some redeeming elements but is up there with Captain Marvel as one of the worst films from the Marvel universe in some time. This also did not need to be almost 2 hours and 30 minutes long. I would score this a 5/10."
2059,5,"Eternal was the Runtime I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could've been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don't know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute."
2060,6,No impressed Many of the scenes were shot in the dark so hard to see what's going on on the screen. The storyline was just so-so not super exciting. Lots of CG in this film. The new addition super hero in this film are not memorable. Marvel has too many super hero movies & the story needs to be creative to get audience's attention. Definitely not this film....
2061,3,Worst marvel movie I've seen The story was super lackluster. They had an opportunity to make it great and instead they played too much in to the political field having to make sure they had all the right demographics in there before they actually thought about the story.The idea of it is awesome. And then you keep watching and waiting for the awesome idea to come to fruition and it never happens.If I could get a refund I would. I recommend pirating it so you don't give them money to encourage making another one.
2062,3,"One of Marvels worst It goes without saying yes the movie looks good, and sounds good, with that budget it would be hard for it not to. Personally I think the costumes or hero uniforms if you will seem to be getting more comic book like which can be good or bad depending. The problem is while Marvel enjoyed a long run of well paced films that managed to flow so well between action scenes, humor, or interesting dialogue that seemed to start to come to an end with Captain Marvel and continues with the Eternals. The writing simply isn't good, and the dialogue just doesn't flow. The action scenes are good as usual, but I found myself wanting the scenes in between to just end to get to the next action scene. If they want the success of the Avengers again Marvel needs to consider moving some funds from the special effects budget and hire writers who's goal is to make a good film and have the talent to make it so."
2063,4,"Please MCU, you're not the pope Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has made its real start after some delay. Although Black Widow and Shang-Chi are officially among the two starters, Eternals is the one that is most likely to give the feeling of a reboot. Chloe Zhao, the director who recently scored big at the Oscars with Nomadland, directs the story of ten god-like beings who, after centuries of inactivity, reunite for a fateful mission to defeat evil.Well, Marvel is gifting us with no less than 10(!) new characters after a decade of stories revolving around Iron-Man, Captain America and co. The Eternals, immortal almost alien-like superheroes, a close-knit ""family"" (they refer to themselves as such around five times in the film - Fast and Furious says hello), who split up after a relationship dispute over their leader Ajak (Salma Hayek). While I already have rough problems with some of the original Marvel protagonists, these are real charismatics compared to the Eternals. None, but really none of these newcomers have even the ring of an authentic personality. The Bollywood star Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and Brian Tyree Henry, known from Atlanta (Paper Boiii), as the technician Phastos, come closest to functioning at least as comic relief - though by no means in every scene. In general, the script relies far too much on cheap one liners and superficial running gags in the second act. The MCU team apparently doesn't trust today's cinema audience with anything more intellectual than a film producer who walks around with a camera and gets on the Eternals' nerves. Hilarious. Now that we have dealt with the ""bright spots"" of the film, we come to our glorious protagonists. Lovers Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden) have about as much chemistry as a dog with a fire hydrant. Every time Madden looks at his ""lover"" with the same stoic look and says ""Sersei, I love you"", I wanted to pull my hood over my eyes. Nothing against cheesy love scenes. But in a film that takes itself so seriously, even including the first Marvel sex scene since Iron Man, and allows these characters such togetherness, it feels like they got stuck in the Parisian love tunnel. Additionally, the screenwriters allow themselves the cheek to include a completely terse love triangle between, and now ears tips, Sersei, Dane alias Jon Snow (Kit Harington graces us as an exposition character) and Rob Stark (who was played by Madden). Thank you for this brazen reminder Marvel.How Angelina Jolie is mocked in this film is the next item on the long list of shame. She runs around, is a supreme fighter and has epileptic seizures from time to time. Say what you will about this franchise, but every film so far has had some entertainment value. Eternals is two hours of lead-heavy action, has its characters line up three times for ten seconds to show how powerful they are and tries to be funny. At least the last act offers something like action worth watching and a final fight and twist worth mentioning. Plus, a superhero movie has never been so diverse (there are homosexual, deaf-mute and multicultural characters). But no, as talented as Chloe Zhao is, please stick to your indie films."
2064,9,"The Most Unique MCU Movie This movie is a rollercoaster, it has a fair amounts of twists, relationships and diversity that doesn't feel forced at all. The Antagonist wasn't the best of the MCU but far from the worst. Solid 8/10, had very minor flaws."
2065,3,"Feels like it's on for Eternity Trying to think of a positive for this, erm it's got Jolie and Hayek in it, there's some John Carpenter's The Thing esque CGI scenes, nope that's it, all the positives I can muster for this Disney boxticking extravaganza, the plot is absolutely dreadful, it's about an hour too long, the good guys and bad guys don't seem to know who eachother were and by the last act I didn't care."
2066,10,"Not that bad Has flaws and typical marvel jokes but i didn't have to look at the time once. It was actually never boring. Some characters were really good, some were too stereotypical like Kingo. I give it 10 to even out the low ratings which are not understandable to me, otherwise 8. The time jumps are really cool and not complicated at all, the whole movie is easy to understand. The animation and locations are really cool! Angelina Jolie was actually really good contrary to what many say. It's definitely not the worst marvel movie but it's the most different one and many marvel fans won't like it ... but it's also not super philosophical. It gives a great understanding of the marvel universe and the powerlevel of all past characters."
2067,1,"👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎❌❌❌❌❌❌❌ One of the worst movie I have ever seen from Marvel banner. I urge you that don't waste your time, money for poor experience of third class movie..Just go and watch some other movies like Dune which may not disappoint you a this one has done.Pathetic script writing, poor direction & action scenes are like they have implemented cost reduction project or Marvel studio is short of money to do some action scenes & VFX.HOPE DEFINITELY YOU WILL NOT GO WITH OTHER BLIND REVIEWS SHARED BY MARVEL BHAKT..🙏 That's it for such a bad movie from Marvel."
2068,5,"Just a stupid movie all together So many contradictions and stupid attempts at being profound. Just dumb rehashed super hero garbage. Feels washed and recycled. Like a super hero movie from the mid 90s. The casting, dialogue, and humor were good. The plot and theme made absolutely no sense."
2069,2,"Worst movie of marvel The pacing of the movie has been so slow, it's just amazing how marvel director even think to allow it to publish, there has been so much past and present it turned the movie into mash potatoes, character development has been the worst and it doesn't even qualify as a marvel movie, whenever a fight scene happens they just fast forward it , why bro why? I think the director should be changed now before eternals 2, they talked so big about post credit scene, it's just not worth it after watching a bad movie. The only one person that saved the movie was the guy that was filming the documentary, he should get all the big salary, I will say again director needs to be changed now and now. Oscar nominated doesn't mean director can do a great marvel film. Out 4 movie in phase 4 this has been the worst and also black widow, I can't believe the whole movie was all about... You will see, but don't watch the movie in cineplex waste of time."
2070,6,"Not MCU best project, but also not the worst Those critics are too harsh, it's not really that bad, not snyder kind of messed up i think. I know the duration takes too long and dull because the director clearly wanted to give each characters proper time to shine, and there's 10 main characters so pretty understandable. The storyline has high stakes but too dry and not thrilling enough.But on the good side, the conflict was very unusual, not MCU's story template, nobody's here really a hero or good guys but also the villains aren't truly villains. I don't know is it a good thing or not but none of the main characters are really stand out, everyone kind of equal. The cinematography was very beautiful, the action package was nice. Overall quite enjoyable. Far more entertaining compared to black widow."
2071,10,"Best marvel movie ever made.. that I've seen at least lol I heard so much about it on the news and loved that it was fighting for inclusivity (plus my friend dragged me in with her) I thought this is the perfect time to give Marvel a shot!! This is actually my first film I watch of the franchise. Also my first film after the pandemic, and I was absolutely blown away by the visuals! They really did not hold back with the fx and I was LIVING. The narrative was a bit overwhelming but I blame it on my lack of knowledge on the comic world. But I overall got really involved and was so pressed that I haven't explored this series until now. Needless to say I was blown away and I really wasn't expecting anything.. MORE MORE MORE!!!"
2072,5,"Long and boring I was so anxious to watch this movie. I love my superhero movies!! But unfortunately I wasted my money going to the movie theater to watch this. The movie was so long and boring!!!! I was falling asleep. I didn't like the story line either. This movie had so much potential, I'm disappointed."
2073,7,Not as bad as most critics are saying Rotten tomatoes is usually good for me. But way off the mark for Eternals. Its a 7.5 for me.I liked the story and it sets up a new series of movies as well. The characters are likeable and all have decent screentime. Kumail Ali Nanjiani had some good lines. Audience laughed in my theatre. The only reason it wasn't a 9 for me is that avengers just set the bar so high. Definitely worth watching..it is most definitely not a bad film:)
2074,3,"Why, Marvel? I love the Marvel cinematic universe. I almost always walk out of a Marvel movie, connecting the dots and inspired to figure out how things might play out in the universe. Not this time.I hate to say that this movie was pretty much everything I hate about the DC movies. It was painfully slow-paced, yet very chopped up and not easy to follow. It was blatantly bad acting at times. There was a huge disconnect between the characters for me. Any ""lesson"" being taught through the script felt very forced. Nothing flowed. It was very anticlimactic.I'm sorry, Marvel, but I literally sighed multiple times throughout this movie in frustration. I was pretty disappointed. It was as if I was in theaters, watching Aquaman again. I left, saying, ""That was just a lot."" It's a shame this wasn't just a transitional series on Disney+, honestly. Hope Marvel does much better with any content concerning the Eternals in the future."
2075,2,"One scene destroyed the movie One scene destroyed the movie, you will know when you see it, it was an unnecessary scene that was forced. I had to rate it 8 of 10, but because of that scene it is 2/10."
2076,10,"the best movie ever The film exceeded my expectations, one of the better Marvel ones. Harry Styles is was unexpected. I think this film deserves a higher rating. Ikaris and Sersa is the best in movie."
2077,8,Absolutely beautiful I loved this movie. The characters were incredible and the diversity blew my mind. Incredible fight scenes and I became so attached these characters. It was a bit slow in places but overall loved it.
2078,1,"Poor mans power rangers, Marvel Woke up! The only other film i rated a 1 was murder on the orient Express and im reconsidering rating that a 2. This woke fest is poorly written, has a stupid storyline and boring fight scenes. Movie tickets $38, popcorn and drink $12... Marvel please reimburse. Shouldve stayed home and watched lethal weapon on channel 7."
2079,9,"Hooked I'm not too sure why this film gets such bad reviews. Marvel is done with the End Game plot, this is a brand new approach. The whole premise of the celestials, eternals and deviants I found really intriguing and I want to see more. Yes it's not a typical MCU film, but Chloé Zhao is an Oscar winning director who directed Nomadland; which is an incredibly emotional film. Marvel knew she was like this and chose her for this reason.Each eternal had their own personality and I empathised with each one of them. How could you not feel so upset when you've been on a planet for thousands of years and learn it was all coming to an end? Plus the plot twist with Ikaris I really didn't see coming, also the end with Ikaris?? I cried multiple times at this film.This film was such a good stand alone film and I think people need to see it as that. Stop linking it to every other marvel film. That chapter is done and it went with a bang. This is new so stop being such a harsh critic!I'm a big fan of marvel but this one really took superheroes and empathy to the next level. It was beautifully done."
2080,9,"A Marvel movie without the hackneyed formula I didnt know Chloe Zhao was the director (had seen half of Nomadland & couldnt pull thru the second half). A Marvel movie meant for adults and with some emotion to boot. Not the usual testosterone driven formula for the host of Marvel movie. When you open a comic book and find something different from the previous comic you read, that is what makes the story interesting. A movie you didnt have to worry about the back stories so much. For many the post credit scenes made it worthwhile - ergo you want to stick to a formula. A tad change, you lose it. The male stars didn't have perfect chiseled jaws and gave the impressions there could be someone normal looking and still do (super-hero)good. Not a doomsday scenario unlike all the other Marvel movies & there makes it a cut above and it didnt matter. Definitely deserves more than the Age of Ultron which seemed tiring. Taking liberty to use a Pink Floyd track in the movie calls for more marks than been given. Kudos to Zhao, migrating from Nomadland vibe to this. Pure gold."
2081,9,"Building the new Storyline The storyline is not perfect i know, but they are building a story, explaining every character and what they going through in a detail and delicate and easy to watchAll the character is very diverse, however if something that i want to improve is only the soundtrack because nothing is memorable and it failed to create a great ambience toward the best acting that all the actress and actor already do."
2082,10,"Amazing Wow. This movie was amazing. Had me laughing the whole way through and actually kept my attention. Crazy plot twists too.Also one of the best parts about this was the incredibly diversity. Made me so proud to be a marvel fan seeing a cast that included a gay couple, a deaf person, and many different cultures."
2083,7,"Better action compared to shang chi Liked the movie, comparing with other marvel movies it may not be but eye-catching scenes and breathtaking actions is more than anything compared to marvel movie shang chi which I felt like watching an animated fight scene movie."
2084,1,"Soooooo boring! Ever since Alexander I wasn't as bored in a movie! Funny thing, AJ plays in both movies.Length, plot, characters the movie fails in all three spectacularly, most of all in the first two."
2085,7,Good but not marvel level I don't think this movie delivered what we wanted but then again it's a origin story so it's fine... But the fact that the director tried her best to make this film and handle huge celebrities and watching them talk made me realise how difficult it might have been. The story is good the whole plot is good but something felt a little off I don't know what and why would Marvel include a sex scene in a their movie this never happened before but okay if fine and this movie focused more on explaining the plot and their superpowers...
2086,9,"Shaky, but Beautiful start... I honestly rated this movie so high because I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially considering that it's just an introduction to the eternals into the mcu. I'll admit that I don't know the comics at all, and hadn't heard of them before the announcement of this feature back in 2019, so I came into this not knowing the characters and I quite enjoyed how they turned out.Pros:The scenery is beautiful. I heard that they shot a lot of the movie on location and tried to use minimal green screen, and that to me made the background so much better. The locations added on to the depth of the various situations the eternals found themselves in.The eternals characters. I know I've heard a lot of people say that there were too many people and too little time to explore any real lasting connections. However, I must respectfully disagree because I felt like the story gave us enough personality from each character to feel like they were a real person with multiple dimensions. I do agree that there's plenty to flesh out in future projects, but as an introduction film they still managed to give a lot of good stuff (definitely enough to fill in the blanks of what they didn't address directly). I found myself enjoying their family dynamic more and more as they reunited with each new eternal. It was easy to point out who was who in the hierarchy. The chemistry & tension was palpable between a lot of the characters. Kingo was so charismatic. Druig was surprisingly captivating (i did not go into this movie expecting to like his character as much as I did coming back out again). Ikaris added real emotional depth to the loyal soldier storyline (he didn't want to hurt his family, but in his mind it was in service of the greater good/goal). Thena was beautifully tragic and also terrifying whenever she slipped out of her conscience state. Gilgamesh was a strong force. Phastos was funny enough. Sprite just wanted to have the chance to grow up which played out well enough (although there were some moments that felt stale). Sersei was nice enough, but at times she did feel a bit bland as character (the rock changing joke with kingo was actually a pretty good representation of her character as a whole lol).The themes were dense and subjective. This content clearly upset a lot of viewers, which is understandable because not everyone enjoys movies that lean more into the ""shades of grey"" right & wrong argument tactic (especially in the superhero genre). I, however, genuinely enjoy this type of subject matter. The overarching argument towards the 3rd act is revealed as to whether it is right/wrong to sacrifice the lives of the minority for the majority. There's also the question of loyalty versus love, and how it relates to how far a person will go to accomplish their life's purpose/mission versus how love plays a part in that decision. There are also some other minor themes that are also pretty dark, but overall pretty heavy stuff lol.Cons:The deviants were lacking for sure. I could understand their use (as presented by arishem during the exposition-dump to cersei), but the only purpose they really served was to provide the audience with the occasional action scene. They were beautiful to look at, and I loved seeing the eternals use their skill to kill them (especially ikaris with the eye lasers, thena's ballerina warrior fighting, makkari sonic booms, kingo finger guns, and even druig's nimble shotgun antics in the Amazon scene).The celestial halfway emerging from the earth. I understand that there was a celestial in the earth growing for a million years already, so he was pretty big before he even started trying to emerge and the earth was fine. However, once he broke through the crust of the earth (head and hand), shouldn't the earth be at the end of its rope? The sight of a giant stone ""statue"" poking out of the Indian Ocean towards the end of the film was lovely to look at, but it definitely made me wonder how the earth's core is holding up after all that. I hope this will be addressed with future eternals content though, so looking forward to that.Overall, I thought this movie was a wonderful addition to the mcu. It's different that's for sure. The darker themes and more relationship (as opposed to action) led storyline is more akin to avengers: endgame rather than avengers: infinity war. It's a beautiful movie that left me with a few questions about inconsistencies here and there, but overall definitely one of my faves. I highly recommend just going in with an open mind because it is a little different than other mcu blockbusters.God bless, and I hope this review helped."
2087,6,"Average MCU entry Let's start with the good stuff. Great, diverse cast. Beautiful cinematography. Genuine moments of lightness and fun pepper the serious tone of the majority of this film.But there are a lot of problems here. Introducing this many brand new characters (to the MCU) in the space of 2hrs 30 with a backdrop of world-saving and cosmic consequences just ends up feeling empty. There's not enough time to care about who these characters are and what kind of arc they go through (especially given the film spans thousands of years). A smarter idea would have been to give time to a small run Disney+ series to expand and delve deeper into their powers and motivations.The script is at times punchy and very 'Marvel', but at others, clunky and stale. Even the first few lines of dialogue are written and delivered in a way that doesn't sit with the wider MCU.**SPOILERS BELOW**For an MCU film it's odd after 20 years of crossovers to not have any other characters appear except in reference. Given the events of the film it seems odd that the likes of Dr Strange or Thor wouldn't appear too try and lend a hand. This lack of connection to the MCU that we have grown to know leaves this film feeling isolated and a bit 'cold'.The film is forced to zero-in on some characters (Ikaris and Sersi) at the expense of most of the others. Sadly the actors playing these roles don't quite have the screen magnetism to carry the film in this way and the chemistry between them is non-existent. Angelina Jolie and Kumail Nanjiani on the other hand are totally wasted (especially in the third act) and light up the film whenever they appear.It's worth applauding the film for showcasing the first LGBTQ+ relationship in the MCU and rather than feeling forced-in it has the effect of giving this character some depth and stakes. His outcome was the only one I cared about in the final battle."
2088,9,"Shocked by this many negative reviews?! How is this a bad movie? All the fans need to understand that just every other upcoming MCU project can't be as big as Infinity Wars or Endgame. IW/Endgame were so HUGE because they had a buildup of 20 movies behind them.Anyways, talking about the movie - Eternals had SOUL and depth which is kinda new to MCU given that most of the MCU stuff focuses more on action. Eternals is different in a beautiful way."
2089,1,Disappointed MCU disappointed me 1st time worst movie in 2021 movie jump from one plot to another plot in very inappropriate way there's not bonding between all characters and lead character is so weak worst.
2090,10,Amazing Well worth it. From start to finish. This was an amazing experience and a amazing movie. Looking forward to seeing more of these characters. Diversity is awesome.
2091,6,"Deep The direction the writers and director took with this Marvel film is very deep and sad. In addition some things just didn't make sense and left you questioning its validity. I wish they would have contacted me to (or a small test pilot group) review and give feedback because there is potential for making it great! .... But it's currently not great.On a good note, there were a few areas that were entertaining."
2092,3,A marvel movie that doesn't marvel. Its a long movie because there are so many scenes which are not required. Comedy is like they're trying so hard to be funny. Also they all have super powers but red head kid gets hit in the head and now its unconscious. Also there are so many unmet ends in it. Like for instance where do those deviants in the cave go after they evolved?
2093,4,"Formulaic, with wasted cast Same old formula. If, after 30ish Marvel movies, you're still into it, I respect that. I also appreciate that this movie will hold a lot of value for anyone who is a big fan of the Marvel universe.However, there is nothing fresh here is terms of the shock moments, or any of the plot, or performances. Do not expect iconic performances from living legends such as Hayek; everybody is shackled by the crushing weight of the formulaic writing and directing. IMAGINE LANDING SALMA MF HAYEK AND UNDER-USING HER LIKE THIS!!!Overall, a very 2D experience."
2094,9,"Wonderful Addition to the Marvel Universe The Eternals would be worth seeing for its cinematography alone ... but it is so much more. Because the movie needed to set up so much back story and so many characters, there was a ton of 'splaining to do. Great action scenes.Don't listen to critics. They are disgruntled boys who take pot shots at any film which pays attention to diversity."
2095,5,Meh. Marvel is getting washed. This movie has so many silly contradictions in it's commentary and beats you over the head with the tired trope about the duality of human beings. The heroes are generic and forgettable. This whole thing just feels super forced by Marvel/Disney. And the plot is so convoluted and half the movie is spent explaining a bunch of it. Lastly it's pretty boring.
2096,4,"Okay, not great This really is an average movie, all those people saying 'it's the best, amazing' they all hardcore Marvel fan and will like anything. Very slow buildup to nothing, in trailers and promos people portrayed Eternals as one of the strongest but some of the avengers are stronger than him."
2097,8,Not like other Marvel films I actually had low expectations of this film and didn't want to see it but was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely not like other Marvel films but that wasn't a bad thing. This movie focuses more on character growth and the relationships between the characters. We got to know them and we got to care for them. I felt like I had a connection with each of the people in the film. I am very glad they took their time with this one. It might feel slow to some watching it because it's not as much action as other Marvel films but it didn't feel that slow to me. I very much enjoyed it.
2098,2,"Cosmic marvel is going to be wrung out for every cent at price of the storytelling. Two Thumbs way, way, way up; except out of ten Thumbs. Cosmic marvel is going to be totally demolished. Systematically deconstructed, whilst adding numbing, emotionally distant CGI action, for the lowest common denominator to enjoy at the expense of any complex meaningful storytelling whatsoever. Enjoy!"
2099,8,"a fresh take for marvel? I went into this film with truly low expectations (which was probably a good thing) but i came out pleasantly surprised. I was in two minds about seeing this film because of all the low reviews from critics and just random people on twitter, i'm glad i didn't listen to them. This film is obviously very character driven over story, and i can see why it's not for everyone but i still don't think it was as bad as everyone says.I really enjoyed and was very interested in the eternals back stories and their links to humanity through out the years and in the end their reasons as to why they should/shouldn't be saved.The visuals, music, sfx were great (as expected from marvel) and i thought that the actors portrayed the characters quite well. A standout for me was richard madden, he's always outstanding in all his roles and this one was no different!I loved all the cultural representation and finally some decent lgbtq+ representation.Now onto the things that they could've improved on: marvel at the moment has an issue with forgettable/one note villains, especially in most of their recent work, with task master, flag smashers, that one guy in wandavision and those weird bat things or whatever in shang chi? And in this case it was the deviants, they were just sort of there for action sequences above else as they couldn't have ikarus being a straight up villain from the start they needed something else.I also have to agree that this film had a lot of different ideas that maybe fell a bit flat, such as thenas whole memory thing (probably could've done without it tbh)but hey what do i know i actually kind of enjoyed thor dark world and age of ultron and everyone loves to remind me that they're bad!"
2100,1,"Vapid Trainwreck An unintelligent, unintelligible movie that tries to seem deep and philosophical with requisite monster fighting thrown in for good measure.Character development was beyond lacking and the characters' relationships to one another were constantly shifting and confusing."
2101,2,"Just awful Everything bad and wrong with our world rolled up into one movie. Woke, bad acting, crappy plot, just a lot of CGI and little else. I watched it for free, and turned it off halfway through."
2102,8,"The biggest risk movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe For the record, I would like to give a rating for this movie: 7.6/10. But 7.6 is closer to 8 than 7, so I give 8/10.Chloe Zhao has stated from the very beginning that this film will be a significant risk to the MCU. Plus a number of great actors and actress like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Madden, Kit Harington, and definitely the famous Korean actor from Train to Busan movie, Ma Dong-Seok. So this is a huge things to do for Marvel.Contain Spoiler!!!Positive: Never doubt from the Accademy Award Winner, Chloe Zhao. She did amazing job for this movie. The cinematography, the visual, and the screenplay just 10/10 from all MCU movies. The story of this movie was pretty unpredictable. Like, who's the real villain? Apperently, these two parties are villain to the universe. This story is something I like the most, the unpredictable and heavy story. And then the ending gave me another cliff-hanger, but this cliff-hanger ending is better than Dune (no offence Denis). Makkari has stole this movie for me. And Ikaris just gave me the vibes of Man of Steel (Superman) for a moment.I'm still don't know why Marvel put 3 iconic characters from DC into this story (Like Superman, Batman and Alfred?)Negative: Seriously, Marvel always making jokes and humor in unnecessary moment. Looks like CA and the Winter Soldier still the darkest and humorless movie in the MCU. The characters of the Eternals, like Thena, Kingo, and Gilgamesh have a little moment in this story unfortunately, especially for Kingo.And I guess there are so many clips from the trailer and teaser that didn't showed in this movie. If there are, #releasethechloescut please 😁But overall, don't listen the critics. This movie is totally worth to watch and so good."
2103,10,"Really good story, loved the movie!!! It opened so many doors... :) I'm huge fan of MCU and I don't know how people can say that this movie is bad. Yes, it's different and that is a good thing.Action is great and like I said in the headline, story is very good. I felt the connection between actors and their roles. Great crossover 2.In the end, very interesting story has been told, so if you don't like, I just don't understand how can you say that you are a fan..."
2104,7,"Good Im not into this type of movie but I saw it due to its cast and director. And I did enjoy it because of the interesting cast. Visual effects, sound effects and cinematography are all great too. But as for the story, it's not my cup of tea. If you enjoy this genre you'd definitely enjoy it, see it on the big screen."
2105,9,"Marvel ous The best of the Marvel films so far. You need to see it in the theatre. Sound and photography are wonderful as are the special effects. Acting for this type of film is very good, and there are several twists and turns."
2106,3,Eh...am I suppose to feel something? You know a movie is terrible when you walk out the theater and already can't remember half of main characters' name and they're all named after mythical characters and god in actual history.
2107,10,"Top 5 marvel films Definitely one of my favorite marvel movies, loved the characters and the pacing of the film was nice. I didn't mind the backstory actually really enjoyed it considering they had to introduce 8 brand new marvel characters. Excited for the next one."
2108,8,"Can't imagine watching this movie without a 4D experience You must watch it on 4D - what a fun experience! There was not much of a story to be honest in my opinion, but the casts and cinematography are great! I could not really take my eyes off during the entire movie :-)) By the way, I am a fan of Ma and Jolie."
2109,4,"MEH Many of the visual effects were good. But that's essentially the only enjoyable aspect of this film as many times i contemplated leaving. The plot is predictable and incredibly uninteresting with a story that lacks structure and constantly changes from flashback to present day, making it difficult to follow. Many characters are 2-dimensional with little to no character development. They are uninteresting and didn't come across as particularly memorable.There are definitely some good ideas here but the film's dull plot, flat character hierarchy and exhausting and unbearable fight scenes don't allow it to reach its potential.Lack of connection to greater MCU made the movie feel disconnected from the rest of the universe that it's meant to be based in. This was better done in guardians on the galaxy (2014).You know a movie is bad when you spend the entire viewing time thinking of a multitude of ways to which it could be improved."
2110,3,Not your typical marvel movie I understand this movie is supposed to set up the origins of these characters but it was way way too heavy on storytelling and lacked on the typical action and humor you come to expect in a Marvel movie. I probably would've enjoyed the movie better if I knew that going in but I expected an action movie. In the movie only had like three or four scenes of action. Just disappointing.
2111,8,"Thoroughly Enjoyable My wife and I watched this film, understood the concept quickly without knowing the source material, the characters and different powers were shown and highlighted thereby distinguishing between the characters for the audience. The historical timeline was engaging and it teased the entrance of Dane Whitman as a future Avenger as he was in the Comics in the period Monica Rambeau led the Avengers. Overall had a great evening watching a new edition to the Marvel Universe."
2112,4,"Boring What a waste of time, should have listened to the reviews and gave it a miss, nearly fell asleep in there, too many pointless actors in the film and pointless stories, the timeline going back and forward was so annoying , could have done with half the cast , and they were literally stabbing each other in the back, what kinda family does that and why does Kingo bail on em, seriously, he might aswell have joined the bad guys, what was the point of that , avoid."
2113,6,"Visuals achieved , forgot to make a story We waited too long for this movie to come out ' went to theater with a high expectation but went back totally disappointed The visuals are amazing maybe one of the best so far , but I dare anyone who watched the movie to tell what really goes on in it , weak script , the story fill down a hill after half an hour , then the movie will take you In a nonsense journey that will leave you confused like what the hell did I watch ! I hope they rap it up In the second he if there is any."
2114,6,"6.5 to be exact I think Eternals is the best the MCU has put out in Phase Four. I don't think it's great, but I don't think it's bad. Its different enough in tone and structure from what Feige has been putting out since post-phase one. It's theme of evolution is a nice change-up from the generic good guy and bad guy routine with an origin story. I think this movie could've been better tho. It suffers from the same mcu tropes as others. The humor and weak villains. It's disappointing bc it's potential shines through in moments. I think had they went all in, this could've been an amazing film, however, I'll enjoy it for what it's worth."
2115,10,"Best MCU film to date. Doesn't deserve the hate. Managed to tell all of the characters back story better than the early mcu tried over an entire arc.Diversity without being shoved down your throat. People are just people rather than agendas.CGI was probably the best to date in mcu, and the villand arnt just grey and bland, they actually have depth and emotion."
2116,4,"Dragged out For a very simple story line it's way to long. Get to the end and you think it's going to happen, nothing! Big cast for nothing. Effects were good and so the costumes but that's it. Hopefully when the make a second film they put more into the script."
2117,9,"Enjoyable introduction of Eternals team A very enjoyable introduction of eternals. A light story (meaning serious when it comes to the existence of humanity in the MCU), however, lightly told enough that we could just meet new heroes. Photo effects beauty thing. I don't know why the movie has many poor opinions .. not every movie will be like Endgame now ... so people a bit lighter cinema awaits us .. here are shown the problems of our planets and what is important in our lives .. a bit different cinema but how it was nice to experience it in over 2 hours of screening. I am like that! I liked the movie."
2118,4,"Frustrated and boring Being a multistarer movie with so many good actors but totally foolish. The story is absolutely weak. It's not a marvel movie. Just a stupid plot with few idiotic twist having no depth. Visuals are good as always. But the story is simply unsatisfying. I'm disappointed, frustrated and angry also after watching this movie. Biggest disappointed of marvel till date."
2119,9,"my opinion The film is very beautiful, but the duration of the film is long and Angelina Jolie did not take her right enough in the film. I feel that she is a secondary character.."
2120,9,"It is much better than people are saying I really cannot understand how people are so disappointed with this movie.The effects are crazy. Really good special effects, the battles look really good and the Celestials are really good too.The story is really complete. All the side stories are necessary for us to understand the type of persons that each Eternal is. Yes, it's a really long movie, but for me it was eye catching the all time. The story is well delineated, the paralels with the ""real life"" are well done by mentioning several historical facts, and the most important thing to me the way that Zhao included several present day subjects like lgbtq+, religious differences (like ""I will never hurt you because of my beliefs""), war and more... It is notable to mention the performance of Angelina Jolie. She is a beast. They could have explored more her mental condition and relationship with Gilgamesh and give ver more screen time, but I Aldo believe that in a next movie we will have that.Higly recommend the movie. It's a different approach by Marvel and it resulted really well. It's nice to see some versability."
2121,9,"Why did Eternals get bashed so badly? This movie takes a new and fresh look at superhero franchises. The diversity in the film's characters, depiction of cultures around the world, be it ancient India, Babylon or Mesopotamia, the aspects of human emotions and conflict in mind that it touches upon, is integrated so smoothly. The only (maybe) chink in the armour is the dragged origin story, and little slow start (but takes up considerable pace afterwards).The reason maybe it was reviewed badly, is because over the years superhero movies have painted a very gallant, high adrenaline rush picture, and subtle aspects of inclusivity, emotions and feelings have mostly been sidelined (not totally). People need to broaden their horizons when it comes to such movies."
2122,10,"That was amazing! As usual, Marvel makes another top movie. First of all, I'm a fan of Jolie and she's definitely amazing in this role as if she was born Thena. I loved the visual part of the movie, soundtracks and gripping twists (especially the ending). It really lifted my spirits as I had seen plenty of negative reviews before I went to the cinema. Fortunately, I wasn't disappointed and I got more positive impression that I had supposed to.Btw, the scene after the movie..I was just like WHAAAT? How did you get in Marvel?? I was really surprised to see Harry and I'm glad he's in Marvel Univers now."
2123,6,"Average MCU movie but still worth a watch Out of the Marvel movies this year (of course excluding No Way Home), the movie that appealed to me the most from their trailers was Eternals, and I had built up quite a lot of hype leading up to this movie. However, I was deeply surprised and saddened to hear the negative responses to this movie from critics, and some casual audience members too, but tried to ignore them after hearing from quite a few fans to not listen to the critics.First of all, this movie had a lot to live up to considering the introduction to many new characters and forming the way for future MCU projects, and unfortunately, I think it crumbled over the pressure.Starting off positively, the CGI in this film is fantastic, and I think it's some of the best CGI we've seen in the MCU since Doctor Strange. And the cinematography was also incredible; one shot in particular that stuck with me was a shot of Barry Keough's Druig walking down an exterior staircase, with flames and the moon in the background, but what more could you expect with Chloe Zhao having such a big role in the film. And the action, while admittedly infrequent, is spectacular. The opening scene of the movie is a team style action sequence with all of the Eternals, and it was easily a standout in the film, I'd consider it one of the best opening scenes in an MCU movie to date. I couldn't resist mentioning the diverse cast that this film offers; which will definitely mean a lot to some viewers. Another thing I loved was the clear and exhilarating display of all of the characters' power range, which I always love seeing in a superhero movie, especially when there is a team of heroes like the Eternals. Seeing a huge display of awesome powers really makes me enjoy a superhero flick more; which is one of the reasons I enjoyed Dark Phoenix (2019), as they showed all of the X-Men's powers in a really creative way. My favourite character of the film is Lauren Ridloff's Makkari, whose powers I thought were displayed well in particular. In recent years, we've been used to seeing speedy superheroes in slo-mo when they use their powers, and don't get me wrong, Quicksilver's scenes in the X-Men universe are breathtaking, but I really enjoyed seeing Makkari running with the camera keeping up with her, no slo-mo involved. I really enjoyed Lauren Ridloff in The Walking Dead as Connie, and I hope we see more TWD actors come to the MCU, perhaps Norman Reedus as Ghost Rider..However, this movie is maybe the most complex film in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, which some people may enjoy and some people may not. I honestly am not a fan of overly complex films; which is why I don't like Inception or Tenet as much as most people. I didn't find this film hugely complex, but it's long runtime and many new characters became overwhelming for me, and it might be for some others too. I know I mentioned that the CGI was great in the film, but in the Mid-Credit scene where two new characters are introduced, the CGI is not great in the slightest, and probably the worst since Black Panther's final battle. Some of the characters don't get much spotlight at all, including Angelina Jolie's Thena and Barry Keough's Druig, which is a shame as when they are on screen they both give incredible performances, as does the rest of the cast. Also, I'm not entirely sure if there's a true villain to this story, you could argue that the Deviants are the villains, but if that's the case, they aren't going to be memorable at all, as only one of them can actually speak, whom is voiced by Bill Skarsgard. Finally, the cameo/introduction to a new character at the end may leave many angry, largely to do with the casting, and I personally thought it was very out of place, but we'll see where that character leads to.Overall, Eternals is a pretty forgettable and controversial addition to the MCU, with some high highs and some low lows. I will look forward to seeing these characters again but not many of them stuck with me at all. I'm more excited to watch the projects set up and teased by this film than rewatching this film as a whole. Still worth a watch for any Marvel fan."
2124,2,"Truly bad on so many levels Very disappointing. Didn't expect too much based on the trailers, but the movie itself is even worse than expected. Booooooooring first hour. The acting is mostly awful. The characters are mostly unlikable so much so that you don't even care if the odd one of them dies. Only 3 characters you kind of feel any connection to, namely Sersi, Phastos and Thena. The others either don't feature enough to care or too much so they're simply annoying (Kingo, Sprite). Ikaris my word, can acting be any more wooden. Most of the visuals are quite good, the only reason for any stars on my review. Babylon looks amazing. The plot is forgettable, the movie feels like it's 80% set in darkness or half light. And can I just stress again, I just didn't care about them!! That's pretty bad for any movie but particularly for a Marvel movie. And especially for me. Part 2 has to be way better or maybe just not happen at all. This felt like a DC movie. Bad."
2125,10,"The Best MCU Movie to Date Yes, I said it.Eternals is a film that will have us talking for years. The explosion of lore and mythology is exactly what this franchise needs. It has broadened the Marvel canvas to levels I didn't think were possible, such was the impact of Thanos but they actually achieved it.The cast are all well presented and unique in character and we see just the right amount of screen time and interaction to make us care about each and every one of them.The special effects are perhaps the best we've seen to date (at least for the MCU).The ramifications of the story are so profound that they make phase 3 seem like chicken feed.As for the post credit scenes - perfect and they've really wet the appetite for the follow up.Go and see it. It's a must see movie as far as I'm concerned."
2126,8,A thinking person's CBM This film is beautifully shot and filled with fabulous performances. It wrestles with issues normally not present in comic book movies. It is an emotional and satisfying ride.
2127,10,"Magnificent This was, so far, my favorite marvel content ever produced.While I do love the formulaic fun of the more conventional marvel movies and shows, they really impress when they try to push beyond it into new territory. And this movie really impresses!The bold, artistic vision of Chloé Zhao is brilliantly showcased, with expansive, natural landscapes and a sense of scale that will leave you in awe. The lightning fast pacing of other entries is replaced with a slower, more contemplative one that allows the audience to better digest and engage with the bigger and more complex themes of the movie.If there is a word for it, it is ""magnificent"". Magnificent imagery and ideas.As a huge fan of all things mythological, it is beyond exciting. Its pantheon of characters are embroiled in an archetypal mythological drama. Various mythological and historical references are cleverly woven into Marvel's own mythology and history.It brings a breath of fresh air to the Marvel Universe, while also greatly expanding its lore.The characters are incredible, as well as the actors portraying them. The special effects were among the best ever produced by Marvel, which is saying a lot. And the action is also impeccable and breathtaking.It's sad that the critic reviews were so confusingly negative and came out so early, because it preemptively poisoned the movie in many people's minds. It's punishing an amazing movie a disincentivizing Marvel from taking risks, which is very disheartening.I hope that for anyone reading, this review can at least convince you to watch it and judge it for yourself."
2128,6,Some good acting but just an okay movie Some of the actors/actresses did well. I liked AJ character and the others but the overall movie wasn't mind blowing. Guardians of the Galaxy was much better....
2129,6,Pretty to look at and kind of fun I love marvel and the whole marvel universe. But this movie made me think 'why does it keep getting bigger and bigger'. It gets to complicated. There are to many other stories that you have to keep track of. I think this movie would have been just as fun if it was set in a individual universe. The visuals are spectacular and all the actors are great. But the armour they wore looked like it was from power rangers and that kind of threw me of in every fight scene. Still a very good movie with amazing special effects.
2130,5,"Weepy Powers During the first 20 minutes of character force feeding we get 3 money shots of heroes standing in a neat row. Character pose moments are especially lame when we have no reason to care about the characters. Only later in the film to we discover that the characters have been programmed. Programmed to desperately claw for the audience's desire to care. The tiring introductions form a jumble of scenes that can best be described as a compilation of character clips. One of the worst of character clips included a suggestion that one particular characters was responsible for developing human innovation and technology. After 20 minutes of unnecessary background information, the film starts to became mildly interesting, but only in certain segments. It's almost like two directors made the film. Some of the actors performances are uneven. Sometimes the anemic volume of comic moments land and other times they fall flat. There are just too many characters introduced in too short at time. Developing an appreciable level of care in the characters or their motivations is an exercise. At the end, we discover that humans are incapable energy husks feeding a giant space egg. Eternals are on earth to monitor the incubation process. But wait! After 1000s of years of hanging out with the walking meatloafs, they've fallen in love. Since love conquers all, the eternals decide to abort the ""Supreme"" offensively late in the development process."
2131,7,"Ambitious. Ambitious, let me say that.The mistake that almost all of us gonna do, is to set to high expectation about this movie. Imo, lower it, and u will enjoy this movie more than what most people said.Eternal is supposed to set something bigger in this second phase, i assume. For such a big task, one movie with quite long duration is not enough. Take ur time marvel, its a big world. With this, the movie seem lost his way a couple of time. It try to catch everything's. We lost the attachment to the characters.The visual was great, intimacy communication its also good, this movie has so much potential.But overall for me, it still a 'good' movie. Not 8 star good, but still good."
2132,4,"A boring and empty movie In short: no connection to what existed before while there are reports. Lots of product views either in words or in pictures. It does not give the time needed to clarify why the bad guy is really bad. It does not give you the desire to see a sequel. And finally, these are probably happening a few hundred years after the events of Endgame because it really is like robbery without police all over the world."
2133,10,"Perfect setup for new characters. The movie features 10 characters. So ofcourse for making a connect with everyone, time is required. Thats why the length of the movie is 157 minutes.So if someone feels that the movie is slow, then they entered the theatre with a tensed mind, tensed for whatever work they do for living.Anyways... 1. The story is very strong that why eternals did not interfere till now.2. Every character gets a proper screentime.3. Action scenes are wonderful.4. Postcredits sets the future of MCU.5. The duet of Kingo and Karun is just awesome.6. Emotion is the major fueling factor of film.7. Perfect way to introduce celestials.The movie perfectly introduces every character and they are all bonded with a strong and meaningful mission.Its a Must watch movie.Dont get affected by fake reviews. They are from the people who live with a closed brain.Have a mindset that you are going to get a new experience and you will be amazed."
2134,9,"Sci Fi at its best - excuse the essay Its clear that people have mixed feelings about this film with some disappointed with the results. There's a few things to bear in mind when going to see it.Firstly it runs for 2hrs 37mins, which is long by any standards. This is something many seem shocked by, so prepare yourself. Secondly if you're looking for the classic MCU trope of a barrage of jokes, this isn't for you. Not that there aren't any it's just not constant.That being said this film is a brilliant piece of cinema. It also does something revolutionary within Marvel films which is usually to ruin heartfelt moments (Endgame excluded). Throughout the movie there are points where the characters show pain and sadness that aren't immediately destroyed with a throwaway joke. And there's actually consequences, no resurrections this time. Its a more mature film with some deeper thoughts, if you want them of course they're not necessary. Don't let this put you off there's heaps of action and plenty of funny moments. This film just invites you to think a rarity in most cinema today not just the MCU, which is clearly not for everyone.It is baffling that some have called this unemotional as this film has more heart than we've seen in most of the MCU. With 10 main characters this is by no means easy. But each character builds different connections with one another showing compassion and conflict just like a dysfunctional or just a real family. After this it's a wonder there's any time left for a plot at all. On top of this the cast is brilliantly diverse bringing a huge sense of unity that feels effortless. It must be remembered that on other large cast films like the avengers each character has been set up prior with several films prior. Might it have been more successful as a 10 part series, perhaps, but the immense scale and visual beauty is like nothing else.The graphics and sets are incredible, leaving green screen behind where possible. Chloé Zhao and the crew behind the scenes have created a feast for the eyes and it cannot be understated. There are countless wow moments which is hard these days with the mass of visual stimulation out there. And the action similarly doesn't disappoint. Each character has a unique ability with visuals to match which we haven't seen before.Overall this film is bold and not for everyone. At the end of the day it's a comic book movie and like the comics themselves they appeal to different people, which is good. And it's fair enough if it's not for you. What's sad is some of the negativity that comes out. Not every film reaches you sure, but it's not as heartless and boring as people make out. Its can be more meaningful if you want it to be or just a story about a family who've been together a long time. The cast and crew have clearly put alot of love and hope into this film and they should be immensely proud with what they've created. If anything I'm a fan."
2135,6,"Enjoyable, but not one of the Best The question that is raised now is whether we have reached, and passed, peak Super Hero films. The reason I suggest this is because, well, after the conclusion of Phase 3 in Avengers End Game, it is difficult to see how they can exceed what they have already done. Also, with so many Superhero films being released throughout the year surely people are simply going to start to become sick of them. Like, okay, I'll probably continue to watch them, but when this film was realised, a part of me sort of wasn't really all that keen on going and seeing it, but did so namely because there was nothing else on. Okay, there was Shang-Chi, but the thing is that apparently we'll be watching that with friends.Anyway, the story goes that there is this group of immortals that have arrived on Earth to deal with these monsters known as Deviants that are basically killing off all the humans. For centuries they have lived alongside humanity, and even assisted them in developing, however at one point they simply drift into the background and left humanity work out their own things and will only appear if the deviants return. Mind you, as far as they are aware, all of the deviants have been killed, so they are sort of wondering why they are still around, that is until another, more powerful, deviant turns up. As a result, they decide that it is time to get the gang back together.Much of the film jumps between the present, and the past, where we are learning about the back story of many of the Eternals. We also learn that they have been sent to Earth by a group of powerful beings known as Celestials (who have made appearances previously in the MCU - with Ego the living planet being one in human form). Some people have commented that it feels that it is overtly long, but I didn't really feel that this was the case. I certainly didn't find it boring, though as with a lot of these films, there is a lot that they have to do to set up these new characters. Mind you, I'm not entirely sure how they are supposed to fit in with the Avengers, considering that they aren't supposed to directly interfere with human affairs (the reason why they didn't help with Thanos, which actually doesn't make any real sense when you learn who Thanos actually is).Yes, we do find a few more things out about Thanos in this film, despite the fact that he has been defeated. Then again, this is a cinematic universe, and the movies have been regularly building upon each other, something that certainly hasn't really been done previously. Yet, in the end, it does make me wonder how long they can keep this going, It also seems to be underperforming at the box office, and the critical reception hasn't been all that great either. Then again, I certainly wasn't all that enthusiastic in seeing this film, but in the end it wasn't too bad.One thing that I have noticed, and I do certainly praise Marvel for that, is that while they do have big name actors in their films, many of the leading roles tend to be lesser known talent. This is the case here since, despite Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie appearing in this film, the main characters were played by actors that, well, I haven't really heard off. Mind you, I suspect that Salma Hayek won't be making any further appearances, though I do note that Kit Harrington appeared in a somewhat minor role, but a role, if you happen to dig a little deeper into the Marvel universe, you will discover that he might actually be playing a larger role in the future."
2136,1,"Wait for No Way Home Instead I guess I'll jump straight to the point from this point on. I couldn't stand couple of the songs onto the soundtrack. It was unpleasant to me, for instance... I don't like when a song like Lizzo's Juicy been overplayed and now in this film. I got tired of it, I also disliked how two of my favorite characters suddenly die. The characters' intentions and their actions turned into wrongdoings were obviously absurd to me, only some smart choices were made. This doesn't even feel like a Marvel/MCU movie halfway in. From the start it looked like you were about to watch a damn Star Wars motion picture instead with a long moving message. In addition to that, Richard Madden ""loved"" Gemma Chan only to betray the Eternals and ruin everything like Anakin Skywalker did. Sounds familiar to me. This is aside from Star Wars relations. I felt like Kumail Nanjiani should've been one of the gay individuals dating Haaz Sleiman instead of Brian Tyree Henry in my opinion. It wouldn't make any sense to me to display that kind of direction if you make abdominal changes for a brand new Marvel movie after an amazing one like Shang Chi."
2137,8,"This movie is really good. I don't understand all the hate. This movie is good! I read that its pace is slow, boring, and you have to wait until the very end for something to happen. That its only good feature is the visuals and the rest is without any point. And that all in all it is a spectacular pointless empty nothing. Oh COME ON! After watching the movie, I believe the hate is targeted and biased.Because the movie is really good! It gets into the point in the first minute! The characters introduction is really well structured! Visually it is stunning! The performances are great! And most of all, it breaks really successfully from the classic Marvel stories, and sets new foundation for the future movies!Seriously, don't listen to all the hate. Have in mind that in IMDB it started with a rating of 5.8, and it increases everyday. I seriously believe there is targeted action to influence the public's opinion for this movie."
2138,9,"I'd pay to see it again I had high expectations for this film, and then the critics reviews came out, and my expectations dropped. After the release, people either loved or hated it, but what I heard was that the film was a mess. It didn't feel like a mess to me. It felt like a lot of exposition, and it would have been a better decision to make this into a Disney+ series, but the exposition wasn't tedious to me. I never found myself bored. The entire film was interesting and the multitude of characters somehow managed to be developed pretty well, given the time constraints to do so.Eternals was funny, exciting, engaging, emotionally moving, and relatable. The amount of diversity was also incredibly refreshing. It reflected the real world-what real people look like-different. Different backgrounds, abilities, sexual orientations. It made this film feel more real in a very fantastical setting.I'd see it again."
2139,9,"2 Hours And 37 Minutes Of A Gorgeous And Exciting Movie People are seems like they still cannot move on with the previous MCU characters or movie, people are still getting used with Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Iron man, Captain America, etc, and when they make a totally different story, different atmosphere , different vibe, a new one, an original one, they just somehow someway disliking it, for me Eternals is a fresh, it's different, it's beautiful, it's amazing, the movie have a lot of solid actor with a solid performance, great action , beautiful looking movie, it was slow but unbored, it's a 2 hours and 37 minutes of a gorgeous and exciting movie, go watch Eternals, forget about what people say, don't be so negative, don't be so positive, be netral and judge it by yourself, it's a really good movie, Eternals is very worth watching."
2140,4,"Cinematically beautiful but emotionally flat I can say that Eternals is not the worst movie I've ever seen. However, it's far from the best. Unfortunately, the beautiful cinematography doesn't compensate for the one-dimensional characters, monotone acting, and the numerous plot holes. The movie lacked genuine emotion and the laughs felt ham-fisted into the narrative. One can't help wondering if the movie's producers were more concerned with scoring points for representation (and in that respect, the movie scores high indeed) than with telling a compelling story. The problems with the movie may have started with the inexperienced screenwriters, Patrick Burleigh (whose previous credits include Peter Rabbit 2 and the TV movie, It Was a Pug Day) and Ryan Firpo (who's never written a screenplay for a movie before Eternals). Considering how much was spent on making Eternals (some estimates are as high as $200 million), it's baffling why Marvel hired such unseasoned writers."
2141,5,"Unemotional and lacking Went in thinking that it'll be ok, if not great, but was greatly disappointed by the middle of the movie, felt a bit bored and definitely lacked something. I was not engrossed or attached to any character and there was some parts that was downright cringey. It had so much potential but didn't live up compared to other marvel movies."
2142,2,worst marvel movie ever! 2 star for comic scenes only! This is a complete waste of time movie. CGI was not that impressive any more.I expected something more than a movie kinda scenario but this movie is total garbage.It should be a series instead of a movie.Die marvel die!
2143,2,"The best bits... the ending!!! Where to start... the acting, the comedy, the twist it all felt forced. The sex scene with ikaris and sersi didn't need to be in the film, phastos representation just felt it didn't go with his characters persona of an inventive genius, that created the atom bomb. Ajak's death and being killed by ikaris was all too easy, in the comics Ajak is a strong character if not the strongest of the eternals team. Sersi becoming a prime eternal was a misconception, she had no leadership quality and was represented as a naive, and attention needing. This film has more to do with representation to make a statement, than it does to tell the story. I just felt the whole time where are they even going with this film.The most exciting thing about the 154min movie was the end credits scenes, which last 1.30mins each."
2144,2,"Action packed Amazing film good characters. Had great fun watching it. The MCU is getting deeper and deeper as it explores new timeliness and universe secrets.Angelina Jolie did a great job as Thena, first time I've seen her acting this good."
2145,10,"Great movie to start of new style of Marvel Really enjoyed it, excellent cinematography and fairly good pacing.Not sure what the critic are seeing?!Maybe didn't need the post credit scenes to let people absorb and process the movie."
2146,1,DESERVES NO STARS After being in various stages of quarantine for the last 18 months my partner and I decided to enjoy a movie on the big screen. Regrettably we chose Eternals based on Chloe Zhao's many Oscar wins last year and usually ignore reviews making up our own minds. Living in Taiwan going to the cinema is a passion especially on the weekends. We went on a Saturday night which is usually filled to capacity and chose 2 seats since Taiwan does not have a sit wherever you like option. The theatre had 10 moviegoers plus us. After 15 minutes we walked out pissed that we wasted our time and money on a piece of crap like this.
2147,5,"Yawn Fest The film was so long and it felt like it. Clunky dialogue, poor SFX and far too much exposition.I looked great, but the leads just couldn't carry the roles.The climax was underwhelming.Highlights were the two end title sequences."
2148,1,"Not worthy of 2021 Not worthy, it was not even worth to download even a trailer. Worst acting, characters, infact overacting and storyline is also lame. It starts too slow and suddenly something happens and nobody knows why it just happens illogical and extremely bad written and characters are worst in its class each of them."
2149,1,Seriously what did I watch? Gilgamesh as japanese dude ?Seriously?Other character was like meh its like the idea of cosplay fan made in 2010 fashion and camera let's just do it.
2150,1,"One of the worst movies of the year Bad story , bad acting , zero chemistry , forced comedy, total poop show. Character development was choppy. Soundtrack was not at the marvel level either."
2151,10,"NOT AS BAD AS THE REVIEW! Very good to watch! Yeah there are so many scene that bear, especially Eternals have 10 main characters. You have to watch this! Don't you ever skip the MCU movies or series from now on! The second infinity Saga is coming!"
2152,8,Good way to open phase 4 I think this film is not that bad. For the story it is good enough to open phase 4. Maybe this film is not emotional but if you read the eternals and celestial comics book you will feel the story is great considering this film is introduction of them.
2153,10,Strong story I loved the dynamic of this movie it was different for marvel but a good different. It makes me excited for the next phase of movies!! I love the choice of actors and their chemistry on stage! I honestly don't know why it has such bad reviews. Captain Marvel made me want to blow my brains out because of how boring it was.
2154,2,"Don't waste your time. A completely boring, slow, drawn out pile of trash. Honestly just awful, marvel finally made a movie worse than a DC movie. Insulting to humanity they think we are even too stupid to invent a plow without devine intervention."
2155,7,"View it as a clean slate, stand-alone film. It easily falls among the more visually stunning Marvel movies. Good performances, great cast. Feels like a DC movie though. More emphasis had been laid on characters than circumstances. Tends to struggle with the narration at some points, but that might just be the only downside of the movie. All the inclusivity is much appreciated and doesn't feel coerced. Not among MCU's best movies, but definitely not even nearly as bad the ratings. Kudos for being experimental with a movie of this scale."
2156,8,"One of the MCU's better films Like many MCU films, Eternals still suffers from generic and formulaic CGI action scenes. Yet, the attempt on making more nuanced storytelling, despite not working all the time and can be clunky sometimes, made it more than just an elevated Saturday-morning cartoon show."
2157,10,"Totally does not deserve the hate Let it be known, I never write reviews for movies. However, after seeing so much hate for this movie, I feel the need to share my review. Sure, if you like the typical, cookie-cutter formula that most Marvel movies have, you may not be a fan of Eternals. But if you're looking for something fresh and different within the MCU, Eternals totally exceeds expectations. The visuals are beautiful and you can really feel the chemistry between the characters, in ways that can't be felt in most other Marvel movies to be honest. Also, the two post-credit scenes alone earn 10 stars in my opinion. It's definitely worth the watch and I'm eager to see where these characters end up next."
2158,10,"LOVED IT! A new favorite! Let me just say, I loved this movie. Excellent portrayals from a star studded cast. Much like Shang-Chi (another top ten from the MCU) you don't need to have a huge background knowledge to enjoy it. Going into it I'd say the only thing you need to know is that the Snap happened, making it an easy view from someone who isn't super well versed in the MCU. It does expand on some previous ideas, but no prior knowledge is needed. It does an ensemble cast well, giving you just enough from everyone to want to know more, but not throwing too much at you. That being said, it is undeniable that Gemma Chan's Sersei is the main character, even if she herself doesn't recognize it at first. I believe this movie has some serious rewatch ability, you'll get what I mean after you see it! The visuals are stunning to watch and the magic is unlike anything we've seen thus far. Academy award winning director Chloé Zhao shines with this piece. It is also the most diverse MCU film we've seen to date, having and equal balance of male and female main characters, a racially diverse cast, a canonical queer main character, a deaf main character (and the MCU's fist deaf superhero!), as well as an excellent portrayal of the different kinds of love. You have familial, romantic, and true, deep, friendship. This is the found family that the OG Avengers wanted but never quite achieved. The only real fault I have with this movie is the sex scene. It isn't explicit and you don't see anything other than faces, collar bones, and I believe a back, but I just didn't care for it. Overall a wonderful and fantastic film that stands wonderfully on it's own but does a wonderful job of setting up future stories. Can't wait to see where the Eternals go next!"
2159,5,"I REALLY wanted to love this movie After the awesome story arc of the infinity saga (which honestly had some disappointing chapters *cough *cough Ironman 2) and a very promising trailer I had high hopes for Eternals. Unfortunately it did not deliver.Simply - they tried to accomplish too much in the lengthy 2/12 hour time and tried to make you care about too much leaving you pretty much not caring about much at all.I felt no connection to the characters and no real or personal intimacy to make me invest in their story. I was not compelled by them. When any of them were killed or taken, I didn't feel sad at all and that's sad, because they are really awesome characters and the actors cast seemed well placed in their roles.I wish they would have taken their time and split this into 2 movies. Made us care about them all and love them. As it stands currently, I left the theater with pretty much the same feeling as I did after seeing Batman v. Superman and the original theatrical release of Justice League.It was not a bad movie. It had some good moments and definite shining comedic spots. It just was not a good movie by any means and leaves one feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. Likely the first MCU movie I will not see in theaters more than once or purchase when released, but just wait to drop onto Disney+ If I even decide to spend the time watching it again."
2160,5,Dragged on and on and on Marvel tried way too hard on this overstuffed overlong mess. The acting was good but the actors where underused especially Jolie that's what you get when you have to much characters. The story dragged on and on especially the flash back scenes they could of cut them out completely. The story it self was also just meh and the villain was meh. The movie was just meh.
2161,3,"Genuinely disappointed High hopes for this movie, but messy, boring with average acting, run of mill special effects and a contradictory story line. Too many characters undeveloped, and was hard to feel any connection or empathy with any. I felt as though it was produced just to set up future movies. Tried to insert itself into the Marvel timeline with one line explanations that defy logic (e.g. Happy to watch the world get destroyed as the Deviants weren't involved).And please, I thought there was a learnt lesson in producing a terrible CGI character years ago.Generous with a 3. Makes Iron Fist look like a masterpiece."
2162,6,"Slow, boring, meh I really wanted to like this, was really anticipating an amazing movie. But it just felt languid and blah. Nothing was that compelling, not the story line, dialogue, or even the action scenes. And being a Marvel film, I expected more action scenes. And so tired of there having to be love story, and so tired of the Marvel films' running theme of non Earthly beings falling in love with the human race, that we're so unique and amazing and worth saving in spite of all our flaws. I liked most of the characters, but it was just lacking something."
2163,8,"A Breath of Fresh Air in the Marvel Cinematic Universe I went in with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised by what the movie offered. Multiple relatively unknown new characters and their dynamics, their stories spanning centuries.It was definitely not a typical Marvel fare that at least I'm acclimated with. Watching this movie, it didn't feel like it's an MCU movie. It was different, something unexpected.I do understand some people not liking this movie. I have some criticism too, like the editing in the beginning seemed a bit sloppy. And watching it in IMAX, the transition between aspect ratios was not smooth, very apparent and a bit distracting. The visuals on the other hand were amazing. Some of the action sequences were really good and were executed perfectly (like the usage of hand held camera during a fight scene between a deviant and Ikaris in Amazon).Overall, it felt nice to witness something very different from MCU. I am eager to see them try new things and take their world to different directions and keep it interesting and unpredictable."
2164,10,"Incredible. This movie is an absolute work of art. The design, the direction, the acting, the writing, the SCORE-it's all immersive and beautiful. I loved it and I can't wait to watch it again and again."
2165,10,"Loved it Really loved the characters and that's what makes it different from the 25 movies before - we were able to learn about each of them, some more than others, but I loved it. And the 2 stings at the end were great in capturing my imagination."
2166,7,"Better than what everyone is saying The beginning was all over the place, but they brought all the stories together in a very good way. It isn't a complete story because it is an open ending to lead into a lot more. I believe this will be a movie that people will grow to love. There is a character in this movie for everyone. It is funnier than other reviews say it is. A good marvel movie. Not great, but it is very well done!"
2167,6,Unlike Marvel Of course they reference previous marvel movies but this movie just lacked the heart that majority of the other marvel movies have. Great cinematic effects but I have a feeling future movies will have to help this one become a better film but it will still be the second costar that people won't remember.
2168,8,"Don't listen to the critics This movie is good, I don't understand why so many people hate it, I personally enjoyed it and I liked the complexity of the story... plus I had a good laugh especially at the scenes when Kingo and his vallet shoot that documentary."
2169,2,"Skip it Too slow, not in a good way. With a 2.6 hour movie you think the character development would be good, but I really wasnt interested in them. The entire movie was a mess."
2170,7,Would see again hoping for a second This isn't my favorite marvel movie but also not what people are saying. I thought it was pretty good. Obviously it isn't going to be as good as the avengers movies but they had like 10 years to develop the whole story line and conflicts this had 2hrs and 30 minutes. I think it's definitely worth watching. I really hope they come out with a second.
2171,2,"Disappointed Slooooow storyline with an anticlimactic resolution. Sad to see Marvel lower its standards. Also, noticeable plot holes... I was really looking forward to the movie and really wanted to like it."
2172,7,"A Fresh New Set Of Superheroes This is the new Marvel movie directed by Chloe Zhao and has an all star cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie and Barry Keoghan among others. They play ""The Eternals"" a group of immortal beings who have lived among humans for thousands of years and have been forced to re-unite to protect the earth from the evil alien species known as the Deviants.This movie represents a new chapter in the Marvel universe and is set after the major battles of the Avengers vs Thanos. The Eternals are instructed not to get involved in any human conflict unless Deviants are involved. They are a fresh new set of superheroes to continue the MCU.This film has divided opinion among critics but for me there were actually more positives than negatives. Chloe Zhao has gone from directing ""Nomadland"" to directing a Marvel movie which is quite a leap across genres. But she's done a good job. The cinematography and filmmaking style with a lot of background and scenery is one unique to her. And she has brought a slight indie vibe to the MCU. There was also of good humour and gaffs brought to this in particular from Kumail Nanjiani. The only real negative that stood out was the battle scenes as good as they were, were a bit samey and wasn't really anything new compared with earlier Marvel films.That said, it had enough depth and character development coupled with good humour and good visuals that it is worth a watch. I wouldn't say the same level as the better Avenger films but decent and I would watch the sequel. 7/10."
2173,4,"Hope This Timeline Isn't Eternal This was almost a dead-even 5/10 star film, but the more I think about it, the less I like it. I HAAAATED some of the incredibly cheap looking CGI. Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.Overall, it's absolutely not the worst MCU movie, but it fits nowhere in the top half best. Since it's barely, like 1%, connected to the other MCU movies, it could be a skip for sure."
2174,10,"Great Movie! Maybe I watched a different movie than what people have voiced their dislike of? But I thought that this movie was great it had the fun we love about marvel movies and stories while giving us something new. If you're just a Marvel movie fan I don't understand why you wouldn't like this movie, if you're a marvel movie and comic book fan then I don't understand what you wouldn't love this movie, I mean there were so many great easter eggs and hints on what may be to come!"
2175,6,Good not great This movie is getting a lot of hate for what really is just an emotional very human movie with some great twists and turns that I personally really enjoyed. Not to mention easily the best visuals in the entire mcu and some great world building in my opinion.
2176,10,Wow I have noooooo idea how people gave this masterpiece!!! A bad review.......it was one of the best MCU movies i have ever saw hands down....................
2177,10,"What is wrong with the reviews?? Ok, this movie was great!! Not ur typical marvel movie, but amazing as it's own movie. Ignore the reviews. Yes it was long but that was necessary for the story, I wanted it to be even longer so we might have seen more story and emotion between the eternals throughout time, but other than that it was superb. Enjoyable through to the end.I honestly think the reason behind the bad reviews is because they are comparing it to previous marvel movies. Just don't, enjoy it as a stand alone, and ull love it. Promise ;)Oh, and did I mention it was soon freaking beautiful to look at <333."
2178,10,"Definitely worth the watch I really enjoyed it. The storyline is a bit confusing at first, but it all comes together in the end. And there's a very nice plot twist at the end if you watch past the credits, I was shocked, like, so shocked, a good shocked though, not bad. Pls, don't believe the bad reviews, I've seen a lot and the movie is actually really good, and is on the same level as the rest of the marvel movies."
2179,7,"Interisting story, too much unnecessary romance The story is solid by the unnecessary romance a little really distract the storyline. Why every eternals needs to get his/her pair? Its funny. But for overall the storyline is ok and also cant wait the black knight coming :)"
2180,6,"Enjoyable for the Most Part It was ok, the stoyline ok I guess not the best, definitely could have been better. Action was great like any Marvel movie, some dumb things happen, but it was a enjoyable movie and fun to watch."
2181,1,"Absolutely Garbage !!! It only gets a 1 because i can't rate zero, don't waste your time or money, this is one of the worst movies i've seen, left the cinema half way through the movie, usually love marvel movies but this was pathetic."
2182,6,"It's A New Direction...Get Used To It The Marvel era everyone knew is over, it's taking a different path and yes I'm on the ride with Eternals. Firstly if its in the hands of Chloe Zhao well it's a great start. Chloe once again uses her technique of cinematography and mood to make you feel part of the journey. Whilst some of the acting and delivering of jokes can be hit and miss, its all part of the experience.The Eternals have been on our planet for over 7000 years protecting us from the deviants. Eventually as all good things have to come to an end, the emergance must take place as Celestials will start again on another planet, and yes we all must die. Do the Eternals listen to their leader Ajak or have they become attached to the planet they call home?Visually it's a stunning film with easy to follow storyline. Reviews have claimed its slow and tedious (they obviously haven't seen Chloe's work). Expectations are always set high on these films, it doesn't need that, seriously just enjoy."
2183,6,Wait for the video. I went in with an open mind after reading the mixed reviews. It was slow and mostly shot in low lighting which did the opposite of setting the atmosphere. On a scale of Endgame down to original Hulk movie? We're talking Iron Man 3.
2184,1,"What did I just watch. This movie was just some random ideas stolen from DC and most of the plot didnt even make any sense. The acting was terrible. For a marvel movie, this is just a peace of trash on the pavement. The budget for the movie was huge and it was supposed to be better than what it actually is. Dont spend your money on this."
2185,7,"Funny view of our life on Earth Interesting Marvel movie. The producer's idea of life on this planet it's entertaining.It's a fun movie to watch.If people work together every problem can be resolved! We should work more together, with other people, to make the world a better place for us and for the future generations!"
2186,1,"IT FELT LIKE ETERNITY What were Marvel thinking, making this. Not one single redeeming feature. This is the only Marvel film I've ever walked out of. It is terrible in every way.1/10."
2187,5,Not what I was expecting I guess Marvel took a page out of WB's book by making a good trailer cover up a mediocre film. It had great visuals and costume designs along with some fresh concepts. Unfortunately a lack luster story and bad casting made this a dull messy ride. If there's a sequel they need a director with a better vision and a strong writer.
2188,1,"My friend wanted to watch this and I wasn't sure what to expect. To say that this is different from any other marvel film is an understatement. Not knowing any of these characters, the film buckles under the weight of each of them. Lasting over 2.5 hours, that still isn't enough to flesh out the Eternals as individuals. I struggled to remain invested with these characters and their goal. The action was uninteresting. The plot was threadbare. Honestly, I barely recall the story of the movie. Watching characters I don't know discuss things I don't know for 2.5 hours made me feel this was a waste. Marvel phase 4? This is marvel phase bore."
2189,1,"Boring. Not worth watching at all, the movie was such a wast of time really. Just save your time and money guys and watch another movie. Very disappointed, Marvel could have done way better considering they made alot of great movies. The actors were super dry and their performance was horrible, even Angelina was really bad in that movie!!!!"
2190,6,"This was the first movie I watched in the cinema after the pandemic The movie isn't that bad. It's not like other Marvel movies. I really liked the acting, effects and music from the movie. The director's job and the cameraman's job were also great. However, the thing I disliked most about the movie was the script and the story. Eternals was the subject I never knew. It's a movie and it's a comic book movie, I understand, but I don't like the story of the movie.It's not as bad a movie as it is generally said, but it's an average movie.I wish things were better. Also, the movie is a bit long.My rating is 7 / 10.P. S : By the way, this was the first movie I watched in the cinema after the pandemic."
2191,9,"A perfect demonstration of phase 4 I was amazed by this movie. I was slightly apprehensive about watching this film after seeing the critics reviews but I made my way to the cinema regardless! And boy I am glad I did...Spoilers ahead....Chloe Zhao did an incredible job of introducing so many new characters into the MCU. I felt each character was developed perfectly, I left the cinema knowing them all inside and out. The diversity of this cast is also worth mentioning - it was truly refreshing to have representation from minority groups in each character. I fell in love with each character (especially Druig...) and cannot wait to see where the eternals are taken in the future of the MCU.I only wish that Makkari (played by Lauren Ridloff) had more screen time alongside Druig (played by Barry Keoghan) because their chemistry was off the charts! Thena (Angelina Jolie) played an incredible part, giving the perfect mix of vulnerability and strength, the platonic relationship with Gilgamesh (Don lee) was amazing and made such a nice change to the standard romantic relationships we're used to seeing. Ikaris (Richard madden) and Sersi (Gemma Chan) had incredible chemistry and I was truly shocked by the plot twist. Sprite (Lea McHugh) played an amazing part, and somehow managed to make me love and hate her character! Phastos (Brian Henry) was a lovely breath of fresh air, he radiated such kind energy, and offered some great comedic relief. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiami) was brilliant, and carried the comedic sense throughout the movie. Ajak (Salma Hyeck) was wonderful, although she deserved more screen time! The visual effects for this film were also breathtaking (Arishum was especially realistic). The plot moved along in a lovely pace, and had a perfect ending which left everyone on the edge of their seats!MAJOR SPOILER I really really hope that Ikaris, Ajak and Gilgamesh can be bought back (even though they won't have their memories). They definitely have so much more to give within the MCU! The introduction of Eros (Harry styles) was done so well, the perfect casting! I am very intrigued to see his future MCU projects. I also get the sense that Eros and Pit will give similar energy to Groot and Rocket which is a dream. Also, the introduction of the black knight and blade was just amazing. All of my Marvel dreams have come true!I am so excited to see where the eternals will go in Phase 4 of the MCU, i get the feeling it's going to be iconic..."
2192,7,"Expected more I'm a little disappointed with this film. After Black widow, and Shang- Shi I was expecting an unreal movie especially with the cast is in it. With so many talent , I was expecting more . I see this movie in IMAX- 3D , so couldn't be better the cinema experience, but doesn't feel emotional like the others movies , when you feel you are in the movie . I know that it's not anything to do with this but DUNE was so much better , the music the writing , etc etc . On eternals was to messing . But I like some things of course . And I don't think that deserve less than a 7 but for the next one I want a a 9 or a 10 ."
2193,4,"Literally worst MCU movie I just got back from cinema.What on earth was I watching? This is so bad on every level!!!! Character development is so weak. There's not a single scene to give you goosebumps. It's just that bad.The only good things is Richard Madden (cause he's hot) And Harry Style's 5 seconds at the credits... Also cause he's hot!! Yup, don't waste your time on this."
2194,5,BORING How is this a Marvel movie?! They should know how to crank out greatness by now. This movie is so dull. Over an hour of set up with very little character depth. Too much telling and not enough showing. Wait for it to come out on Disney+. Not worth the theater ticket.
2195,2,"Not a fan. My least favourite Marvel movie I gave 2 stars because of Makkari and Druig. I like them, they bring light joke into the story and Makkari fighting scene is so satisfying (yeah, I love her last fight that turns Ikaris into a punching bag. That scumbag deserves it)At first, the premise is interesting but along the way it gets worse. The plot is all over the place. Let me explain, I will try to be as short as possible.First, Sersi. I am confused with her power (fyi, I don't read the comic book) because of the scene when she turned the deviant into tree (other eternals also confused of how she did it since she never did it before. This part is never explained until the end). She killed the Celestials by turning them into a white stone with her touch.Second, Sprite. I think her love triangle story with Ikaris and Sersi is unnecessary. It feels forced, lack of foundation. Throughout the movie, never hinted her love for Ikaris..and then BAM! Near the end, she just switched sides to Ikaris because Kingon said she loves Ikaris.Ikaris, a traitor who kills Ajak because Ajak want to stop the birth of Celestials. In the end, he just stood by doing nothing to stop Sersi since he couldn't bring himself to kill her (or even attempt to hurt her)The deviant. They feel like a filler that only purposes is to served as a background story for Celestials. The problem is, this is dragged too long up until the final fight when the fight split between thena vs the deviant and ikaris vs sersi,phastos,druig,makkari.Ajak, nothing much about her. She only shows in some scenes. In the beginning she is the leader of eternal and then Ikaris kill her.Thena, a hero with handicap unable to fight bcs of her insanity. Sometimes she goes crazy and tries to kill everyone in sight. Her real fight only start in the final fight when she fight the deviant to avenge the death of Gilgamesh.Gilgamesh, a great cook with incredible strength. He cares a lot about Thena. He dies protecting Thena, when deviant attack.Kingo, he doesn't participate in last fight bcs he doesn't want to fight Ikaris. He (and Karun) is like a clown in the party, brings jokes into the scene.Phatos & Makkari, they appear only in the beginning and near the end of the movie.Druig, a mind controller who built cult-like village in a jungle. In the last fight, he is brutally thrown from the air and shot with laser by Ikaris but miraculously survive.To sum it up, this movie feels like they try tp cramp up a lot of ideas and forced a plot twist but fail to do so since it is lack of emotion, actions made by the characters doesn't make sense, easy to predict, plot holes here and there, the length of the movie is too long, etc.If you are a fan of Marvel and curious for Marvel new movie, then go on try to watch it for your own satisfactory but don't expect too much. If you are looking for a good movie with solid story, I suggest you just skip this one. Note: As usual, they have mid and post-credit scene."
2196,9,"Very good movie The visuals, the fights, everything was so appealing. A lot was uncovered, but it was fun to learn the deeper world of marvel. I do wish there was a part 2 of this movie, since these are new brand new superheroes and I feel like there is still much to learn about them."
2197,10,"GRANDIOSE! There is so many epic cinematography shot.Costume and set era design was mind blowing.Great cast and so diverse. Which to me is a good thing. ETERNALS bring the Origins of MCU myth to life. Setting for far greater threat in the future. Cant wait! The story pace maybe for some is too slow but remember this is stretch from the dawn of mankind till the present day. A lot to unpack and i think chloe the director complete her jobs perfectly. Too much to unpack mean, a little time for character moments which mean some people may find lacks of chemistry for some character."
2198,1,Awful film Avoid at all costs dull & boring and god knows what it was about . I walked out had enough was falling asleep. One minute in London then next scene somewhere else . Worse film I've seen in a long while.
2199,8,"Unconventional If you go into this film expecting your typical marvel action flick, of course you're going to be disappointed. If you want a rich sci-fi drama with many flawed characters, you'll love it. While not perfect, Zhao offers a very slow paced and beautiful ride with spectacular visuals and an incredibly deep story with so many layers. I originally was a bit lost with this movie on the first watch, but after going again and having a clear understanding of the premise and characters I can say I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The introduction of Galactus was spectacular and I genuinely can't say I predicted the twists giving us a much more nuanced and broken look at 'heroes and villains'. Hope to see more experimental films like this in the MCU, great job Chloe."
2200,1,Marvel At its All Time Low Ill summarize this movie in one sentence: this movie is one of the most boring things i've ever seen and every single character is boring and stupid. Over all I think this movie does two things wrong that really brings the movie down witch includes the characters and the pacing. For a story that can be told in a half an hour this movie is two hours and thirty minutes long. With such a long run time very little of it peeks my interest. The second thing wrong with this film is the characters. I think what makes Guardians of the galaxy so good is the interesting characters while in this movie every single character is super stupid and I hate them. Overall I wished the movie was never created and Marvel please do better in the future.
2201,10,"I never thought I would see existential issues addressed so beautifully in an MCU movie. The film starts off very slowly, but as the film unfolds, you realize how crucial it was that the film took so long to develop its ten main characters. Each one has their own way of interpreting the relationship between Eternals and humanity, each one was marked in their own way by this relationship, each one acts in the end of the film according to this development. The relationship between the Eternals themselves is also amazing to watch (but not always good) and the plot still addresses issues such as faith, loyalty, heroism (at the root of the meaning) and manages to also bring exciting action sequences in the second half of the film."
2202,5,"I love this movie but... I also kinda dont like this movie. Love the story, the characters, the ideas of it but hated the excecution. Some scenes looked like they were choppily edited together, it doesn't seem seamless if you know what I mean, it ruins the flow between scenes. Also the dialogue, ugh I know this is a superheroes movie so a cliche is pretty much expected. But dangg, some dialogue needed refinement and not too much on the nose. Especially in the opening scenes, gaahh, slowly nodded, slowly talking, slowly picking up things for the dramatic effects, like, who shots this movie?? A fan? A high schooler with a camera?Okay moving on to the things that I loved. The cast that stands out the most to me is Barry Keoghan, Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Don Lee and Bryan Tyree Henry. The weakest to me was Gemma Chen, the supposed protagonist. I love how they're all different characters with different point of views, when you watch other MCU movies, oftentimes they're all overlapped, everyone is almost always funny with each punchline. With Eternals, not everybody is funny which is very refreshing! Some are more serious than others, more cynical and more gloom. I also love the story of Thena and Gilgamesh, Angelina's role even though she's not the protagonist, she stole every scene she's in and that part with Gilgamesh breaks my heart a little bit. Kumail also shines in this, I love Kingo and his valet. The comedic relief is not over the top like some other MCU movies.I enjoy the characters, the storyline, the overall plot , the overall design set and but I think this movie could've been executed better. The editing, the flow of the scenes, the direction of some lines, the CGI in some parts is horrendous, this could easily be a 9/10 movie but alas, cant have all perfect MCU movie. Hope they made a sequel though as I love these characters."
2203,10,"A cinematic masterpiece Eternals had the job of juggling cosmic expositions, introducing 10 central characters and level up the MCU to celestial levels; all of which this Chloe Zhao's entry does spectacularly.I never do bother about the so-critics or whatsoever and I'm so glad for it.The movie is shot so intricately and spectacularly. Each scene is well written and the entire narrative is very very fluid, perfectly balanced with necessary action sequences.The style of action and approach too is unique and with so many MCU firsts, like the first sex scene, the first gay intimacy, first celestial encounter, this movie truly delivers.Makkari and Druig are my favorites though I really can't settle on one as each one of them stood out on their own, given the fantastic direction.I loved this movie more for its cinematic approach and would have loved it even when it were not a MCU flick."
2204,8,Nice introduction about eternals from MCU I dont know why everyone give bad rating for this movie. As MCU fans im quite enjoy how this movie represents story about eternals. Its kinda slow story back and forth plot. I can understand why coz its new era and we dont know about the origin of eternals why they came to earth whats their mission. Its a long long story from comic with a lot of characters and still good they can explain it in 1 movie. Thena is the best cast i love angelina jolie in this movie. Se so stunning and elegant. Please respect and give good review guys. Its not easy to describe a lot of main characters in one movies so fans not confuse.
2205,9,"Great film! But... I wrote a long thousand something word review but the IMDB app deleted the whole thing... great.I'll say this, the movie was great. It was simple and beautiful. It only worked out in the end because of Ikaris, if not for him and him staying true to Arishem's vision it would have been a lot more boring. I'd probably have rated it 3/10 then.As it is the movie suffers from a rather slow start and middle part until things heat up in the end. The cast is pretty decent otherwise, the visuals and sounds are stunning and I'm Team Ikaris the whole way.Remember that GOT quote, "" Bear Island Knows No King, But The King In The North Whose Name Is Stark.""That quote shall serve you well here and also remember Jon Snow is a Targaryen not a Stark... anyway enough GOT references here. I am eagerly awaiting Eternals 2, I hope the director is changed or the storyline is given a bit more substance next time but all in all a great film.P. S. I also feel as if the cast was not chosen necessarily on acting ability alone, but rather so that the director/producer could appeal to a wider audience of people(LGBTQ+ Communities Etc).Anyway 9/10 from me, I can't give it a 10/10 with that ending for poor Ikaris.#TeamIkaris."
2206,6,"Good moments and themes; but it's a MESS POSITIVES:1) Angelina Jolie is a great actress and really adds some gravitas to the film 2) There are definitely some great themes in the film and some very deep questions that are asked. It's a shame this wasn't explored in more depth 3) The action scenes were mostly shot very well and the direction in general was good 4) You do get the sense that the characters are a family and this made their interaction scenes very engaging to watch 5) The twist was actually pretty good and surprisingNEGATIVES:1) It's a MESS. It felt like watching 4 films crammed into 1 2) The constant switching of locations, times and characters made it very difficult to care about what was happening 3) The valet character was SO ANNOYING and actually all of the film's attempts at humour fell flat on their face for me 4) The post credit scenes were both a waste of time 5) The massive stakes that the film has basically made me think back to films like Iron Man, Ant Man and Black Widow and just think that the MCU has gone sooo over the top that now those older films with their more grounded stakes feel completely pointless."
2207,7,"Visually stunning but drags a bit If there weren't so many MCU movies being released at once, i would've been ok with this being pushed back to work out the kinks. Visually it was great and had a great premise with how they've existed all this time but had to remain in the shadows. It drags on for a while with little to no character development and there's really no chance to connect with any of them. The plot had me intrigued, but they throw so much at you that it felt a little overwhelming at times.While the diversity of the cast was great.. Besides Kingo, Marun, Phastos, & Makkari...the rest were more or less forgettable. I kinda get why Ikarus had that cold and distant feel (due to him knowing the true nature of their mission and didnt want to get attached) but the rest didn't really have a chance to develop, which is unfortunately expected with so many characters in the film. I didn't even know his name until i looked it up, but the Kro character was just.....there. He had a few lines and was dispatched without any real drama. Kingo not appearing in the final battle seemed like a bummer, him and Ikarus banting back and forth wouldve been entertain, but i digress.Overall it was a good movie to move the Marvel story along but it had so much potential to be better.The post credit scenes were ok. Not sure what's happening with Thano's brother, but Dane's reveal as Black Knight looks interesting. As well as finding out that it was Blade who spoke to him at the very end."
2208,6,"The worst of the MCU, but still not that bad I was far from excited about Eternals because it is delving into an aspect of the Marvel Universe that I never followed nor cared about, and my skepticism was warranted because the movie was indeed strange and decided to build an entire creation myth for the MCU that leads to more questions than it does answers. I was also leery because I was not a fan of Nomadland, and was worried if Chloe Zhao was the right director for this type of movie. That concern also seemed justified as the film (though beautiful) had a number of slow plodding moments, didn't have the greatest acting performances, and got lost in massive exposition dumps that over-explained every single detail of the plot. Perhaps the most frustrating part is that her style of film-making is totally incongruous to the battle sequences that are clearly handled by a different team (and have probably been in development before Zhao was even hired to work on the movie.) This isn't a film vwith a singular vision that has been executed from start to finish, and it just makes me wonder why the decision was made to put a director like Chloe Zhao in the driver's seat based on her past films.Yet, despite the fact that Eternals is easily my least-favorite MCU film to date, I still enjoyed it to some degree. I eventually got invested in the characters, and liked their different arcs throughout the film. What I kept thinking while watching the movie is that even in a lackluster effort, this is still a better Justice League movie than anything DC has managed to make. That comparison isn't just in my mind either, because both Batman and Superman get name-checked in this film, and there are a lot of correlations between the famous members of the Justice League and these Eternals. It's almost like some script-writer was openly thumbing their nose at Zack Snyder and saying ""here's how you really do it."" There were some great moments in the movie, and I liked that they actually took some different paths with this story than you might expect, even addressing a handful of complaints that have been levied against MCU movies in the past. It is still flawed, it is the MCU movie I will rewatch the least, and it is not a direction I want them to pursue in the future. But I wasn't completely mad at Eternals, which is more than I expected when I sat down to watch it."
2209,8,"Um, this was a bad movie? All I see all over the internet is how this movie is boring, flat, and brings nothing to the table aside from great visuals. I walked in expecting a boring outing, and was totally proven wrong thank goodness.The story of the Eternals is massive and there are 10 new faces to the MCU, so it is understandable why the story and some scenes kind of move along fast. Yet Eternals doesn't waste any time at all, it intertwines the past with the present.The themes and metaphors to life, religion, and mythology are just astounding. The acting is great. The dialogue isn't always the most verbose for it has a massive story and alot of characters, but by the end of the film you get that old Avengers feeling again. The action was sick and the heroes all utilize their powers correctly, unlike Ant Man who could have shrunk and destroyed Thanos from the inside out.Overall go see it! This is one of the better Marvel movies!"
2210,9,"A different MCU This was such an interesting film to watch. It's a different MCU film, with harder battles happening within each character rather than against an external enemy. The moral dilemmas each Eternal has, what they expect of humanity, and of themselves are quite on point. On the negative side, acting seems a bit dull at times, which is odd. And there are some things in the movie just to connect with future MCU projects (without really affecting the plot at all).Other than that, an interesting film with really good music and visuals, at a different pace."
2211,7,"Entertaining but not marvel at its best This movie watched more as a DC universe story than marvel. There were more DC comic references than marvel at that. It was a very entertaining watch and the story created great love for the different characters. I was disappointed by some of the lack of screen time for the more beloved characters as the one demential ones got a lot more which made the movie less enjoyable.The end credit scenes did not seem to set up eternals in the marvel universe in the near future (although I am interested to see what they do with the timeline alterations) which also left this movie not setting its mark like the other marvel movies that have come out this year and that are scheduled to be released in the next year.All that being said, this is different than any other marvel movie which is why is should not be compared exactly to the others, despite them being in the same universe. It felt more as a stand alone film and didn't leave me wanting more. I felt like it barely met my expectations and will not have be lining up soon for another rewatch."
2212,7,"Works well enough The interesting thing about creating a Cinematic ""Universe"" (like Marvel has done and others are desperately trying to do) is that because it is a ""Universe"" you can tell different types of stories with different types of characters in differing styles.In ETERNALS, Marvel has really attempted to open up their ""Universe"" by introducing their audience to the Eternals, celestial beings that are tangentially interested in the goings-on of the human world.It's not a Super-Hero movie, per se, it's a world of ""Gods and Monsters"" (to steal a phrase) that has repercussions across the Universe.So with this background in mind, the ETERNALS succeeds, mostly, because it is trying to be something...else. NOT a SUPERHERO film, but something on a different plane.Unfortunately, this probably will put off ""Fan-boys"" who want ""more of the same"" (more Avengers, more Thanos, more F/X smashy-smashy, fight-fight) and ETERNALS just isn't intended to be that.Your first clue that this film is trying to be something else is the choice of Director - recent Oscar Winner Chloe Zhao (NOMADLAND), known for her personal stories and interesting visuals. She brings that sensibility to this film and it (mostly), though it is the type of Cinematic style that works best in low-res (like an independent film like Nomadland) rather than large IMAX Comic-book film event films.The movie itself is entertaining...enough. It is, necessarily, slow at the beginning as Zhao needs to set up these characters and the realm that they are playing on (and orient the audience as to how this fits with the AVENGERS:ENDGAME of it all). There are 10 (yes, TEN) Eternals to introduce along with ancillary characters, so the film has to take some time to gather steam.And...it gathers steam, not in the action sequences (which are serviceable) but in the characters and the character interactions and this is where the film really works for me.Gemma Chan (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) and Richard Madden (Rob Stark on GAME OF THRONES) are, basically, the lead characters as their relationship takes center stage for most of the film - and these 2 (especially Chan) holds the screen well, which is tough to do since there are so many characters - and so much other things going on.The real hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, IMHO, is the Casting Director who, time-after-time, plucks relative unknowns and throws them into parts that they are perfectly cast for...Salma Hayak (leader of Eternals, Ajak), Lia McHugh (Sprite), Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari) and Barry Keoghan (Druig) all fit their parts well, with the relationship between Makkari and Druig being particularly interesting.Speaking of interesting relationships, Ma Dong-seok (so good in the Korean Zombie flick TRAIN TO BUSAN) as Gilgamesh almost steals the screen from MOVIE STAR Angelina Jolie's Thena...almost. Jolie is a MOVIE STAR that just walks onto the screen and commands your attention - and she is perfectly cast as Thena. It is a very smart use of her talents...and her personae as a MOVIE STAR and works very well.Finally, it took awhile for the film to figure out what to do with Kumail Nanjiani's character of Kingo (and Nanjiani's tremendous comedic talents), but, eventually, they do figure it out - but not entirely - which is really the problem with this film. It ALMOST figures out the formula to make this huge, broad, galactic film very personal, but doesn't quite get there.I liked, but didn't LOVE, ETERNALS. I applaud what this film tries to do and I am fine with where it went and was entertained by it. If this is the first part of a journey, then I am anxious to see where ETERNALS goes from here. If this is a ""one-off"" film, then it doesn't, quite, work well enough.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
2213,1,"Opposite of all Marvel movies Usually in marvel movies, we got attached to characters emotionally and have deep understanding of their abilities and super powers The movie is an empty shell, adding super stars like Angelina Jolie or Salma Hayek didn't save a movie like that Even the twist was very expected and not shocking If that movie is shaping phase 4, it will be very hard to see a success for phase 4."
2214,9,"Just what I had expected, but then it surprised me Marvel usually doesn't disappoint me (there's two or three exceptions), and neither did this movie. I had thought that Angelina Jolie would ruin the movie far more for me than she actually did, I'm not a big fan or her playing herself with a few fighting scenes. Sorry gal.I like how most faces of the main cast were already some kind of famous, and I think they've been chosen quite well. They're not meant to have any really noticable amount of chemistry, given they are what they are. The story itself is very good, and they've managed to balance action and story quite well for my taste.Also, both post credit scenes were promising as they bring up the ""promise"" for new movies and/or tv shows from the Marvel universe. And can we ever get enough of that?"
2215,10,"Watch it and judge for yourself instead of listening to critics blindly👍. I love the movie and all the characters specially Ikaris and Sersi 😍 I believe that the critic reviews were quite rigid in what they think a marvel movie should be. This movie is an underrated gem. Best Marvel movie from a storytelling perspective since Endgame I don't know what the hell critics were watching the character development is great, the action choreography is amazing, fast-paced and fluid and visual shots are stunning. Ikaris and Sersi character arcs are really well done and the rest of the actors put up great performances. The on-screen connection between Gemma Chan's Sersei and Richard Madden's Ikaris made me go through so many emotions. This movie is 10/10 in terms of Marvel standards love mature storytelling love deep philosophical themes and love most of the characters watch it and judge for yourself instead of listening to critics blindly. Please Go And Watch It In Theaters 👍🏻"
2216,6,"It's Fun. But Not Dying to Rewatch. I enjoyed this movie. Yes, too many characters, too many themes, and too many plot lines, but, still a fun ride.Definitely worth watching if you're into Marvel stuff. But you can probably wait for it to come out on Disney+. Wish they did it as an 8 episode series or something."
2217,7,"Not sure why this is being slammed as one of the worst marvel films The movie is good! The beginning is a bit slow and a bit confusing but once the ball starts rolling with the movie it's not a difficult watch and it's not bad or anything. There are a couple weird parts but they don't distract too much from the overall plot and structure of the movie.The movie feels kind of goofy at times because of how grandiose in nature this movie is, but it's definitely interesting and done pretty well. There are a couple plot twists in this movie too that I did not anticipate coming even as an avid reader of the comics.Suffice to say you don't need to listen to critics on this one, the movie is worth a watch. Downside is that it is almost 3 hours though."
2218,1,"The worst MCU movie by far. Seriously lacking in soul This is my very first review on imdb but this movie was so bad I had to post it.Both me and my fiancee are HUGE fans of the MCU and love what they have done since Iron Man 1. One of the things we love most of all about the MCU movies is the passion and soul they all seem to have, even our lesser favorite movies. This movie has none of that.Even with the A-list type cast, stunning visuals and huge budget I found the movie dull, boring, lifeless and pointless and I didn't care about any of the characters or what happebed to them, at 1 point I even totally forgot 1 of the main characters had died untill another character mentioned it a while later. Not a good sign. I hope this is not a sign of things to come with the MCU.This film is just awful on a massively grand scale."
2219,4,"Total Dissapointment I just watched this movie in the theatre this afternoon and expected something more than what I just saw. The trailers did deceive me to think that this movie will be enjoyable, but the truth is quite the opposite.This film was directed by an Oscar winning director yet it feels like it was made by some amateur director. This movie sold you A-list actors and actresses, not a story.Eternals is unfortunately feels out off touch from the rest of marvel movies. They did mention Stark and Rogers to ""hype"" it up, they did bring the blip, talking about the impact but it feels so ""separated"". Eternals is like a stand-alone movie not a continuation of a well-known franchise, the tone was different, it seems that they force it to be a part MCU and hell for 2 and a half hours I still can't comprehend what is going on.I thought it must be the pressure of introducing a whole new set of team, but GOTG did it so brilliant that it hurts to see Eternals. The script was horrible, there is no chemistry whatsoever between actors and the worst thing is about the acting itself. Ikaris has to be the worst character in this movie as it has very inconsistent personality and very flat expression that escalated to dramatic scenes at the end. This probably due to the script but still, it was horrible.The flashbacks are annoying, that it should be put as chronological orders because it hurts my head to follow so many different place, period then back to the present day. Again. There is so much time jump in this movie yet the narration feels like it was meant to be a history style of story telling I don't know why Chloe Zhao thought this was a good idea.Albeit all the negative sides. It has very picturesque visual effect as you can expect from Marvel's films. It has unique story but it has major issues that can be fixed in the upcoming sequel."
2220,10,"Not bad I watched this movie twice, second time in IMAX is definitely better than the first time when I watched in 3D. Most people will either love it or really hate it, it's a new style they are trying, and I believe this movie is like building a stairs, it is the first step, each movie follows after this will be better and better. I am looking forward to see the next movie."
2221,2,I love Marvel movies but.... This movie was so boring. Acting was often painful. And the dialog and plot was so disjointed. I was so desperate to see a move in the theaters that I ignored the other reviews. Please don't make the same mistake.
2222,6,"I hate censored In Indonesia came with many censorships, and cutting without smooth scenes. Many questions about this movie have epic fighting but something loses from this movie, they don't have enough emotion only when showing up Harry style on the ends."
2223,4,"Not The Best Execution Pretty average edition to a great franchise. The film felt directionless and underwhelming. The characters were uninteresting and hard to vouch for, and the best character was a fat Indian side kick. The effects look good, as does the cinematography, but that's a standard for Marvel filmmaking, it's the execution and momentum of the vision that fails."
2224,7,"Super-Unexciting Superheros Does Eternals veer too far from the source material? Probably. But who has read it? Does it offer exciting revelation to MCU canon and leave viewers wanting more? NO. Is it slow-paced? Yes. Is it action-packed? No. Is the material internally consistent with it's on world-building? NO. Are there too many contrivances? YES.All of these issues make for a lackluster, eye-rolling experience, but not so bad that I regrated watching.It felt like the writers had too many creative constraints for them to work with: 1) Eternals should be active in human affairs throughout history, but also should be unknown and hidden in present day; 2) Eternals shouldn't know their overlord's real goals because that would make them unsympathetic; 3) and Eternals couldn't grow as characters over 7,000 years, but must remain relatively dumb, motivated by basic, teenage human emotion. Marvel has a serious issue with developing good stories that expanding it's mythology, and Eternals puts this front and center.My advice would be to start with the villain's intents, goals, and his lack of empathy for good. This would be very similar to how Peter Jackson used Saruman in the Two Towers. Instead, we get a rehash of Watchmen, Wandavision, or Captain Marvel.This movie was a huge wasted opportunity and a disappointment, but I still deserves a C. 7/10."
2225,9,"Great Movie! Definitely doesn't deserve the hate that it got. Eternals is not like any other MCU movie - it's dark, it has a different tone, it's mature. And that's not a bad thing; it's still a GREAT movie. What I liked about it is that they filmed the scenes on the actual location instead of using the CGI, and you can clearly see the difference; It looks amazing. The direction and cinematography by Chloe Zhao in this movie are GREAT! I don't know why some people and ""Critics"" didn't like this movie. It's not a perfect movie; it has many flaws, but I certainly enjoyed it, and it was worth my time. (btw, longer running time is a 'pro' not a 'con')"
2226,1,"Worst MCU movie ever. It's illogical keeps on traveling back n forth. After Loki Marvel could have thought something better but failed miserably. Not worth to watch in theaters, no any continuation. This movie is actually tries to get forcefully itself in to MCU, where as why eternals sleeping during thanos not justified. In one instant it is tried to convince that externals were asked not to interven in human ongoing issues.Total waste of time."
2227,4,"Not a Marvel movie It felt like someone who had never seen a Marvel movie before took about a year to write this deep romantic movie involving 3, maybe 4 characters. Then the boss was like, ""Hey, I'm giving you $200 million. Add more characters, some action, as many flashbacks as possible, and a LOT of CGI. String it together with a huge talking head and a few lukewarm jokes and have it on my desk by Monday.This wasn't a ""Marvel"" movie. This was an indie drama with a huge budget.And the choice to recycle the main character from another Marvel movie gave me AHS, anthology vibes that I didn't like. There is not a shortage of actresses. Just because she's not blue this time doesn't mean we don't recognize her. Find someone else.This is the *Only* Marvel movie in 10+ years that I only need to see once.It wasn't great."
2228,9,"Why the hate? It was actually quite good! I wasn't expecting much after some hard reviews, but I have to admit it was surprisingly good!I agree it was not a typical Marvel movie, but besides that they did great job to introduce all 10 new characters properly.The story, concept and how they translated this to the MCU is truly magnificent. Also a big thumbs up for the diversity in the movie.It was a well balanced movie which is certainly worth watching."
2229,4,"So much Crying! It felt like someone who had never seen a Marvel movie before took about a year to write this deep romantic movie involving 3, maybe 4 characters. Then the boss was like, ""Hey, I'm giving you $200 million. Cram in about 7000 years of history, add a few more characters, get some fight scenes in there, and I need a LOT more CGI.

2230,8,"Good movie Movie was good. At the time entry in theatre , i have low expectations because of the critics reviews but movie was good. So many amazing scene and action scene. But some character have more potential. Overall, it is a good movie."
2231,6,"The Phastos and the Fur-Eros. It seems now that there's a real desire amongst some to be the first to declare Marvel's unprecedented run of hits as being over. For a while it's seemed like ""Eternals"" was the most likely to fail, given that there wasn't much in built adoration for the characters going in and whilst I'd accept that this is the ""worst"" film in the MCU, that's still pretty far from being an out and out disaster.Since time began, life in the universe has been seeded by the Celestials, a race of incomparably large creatures of unfathomable power. Once life on a planet has begun, it's defended from an ancient enemy, the Deviants, by The Eternals - a group of ageless humanoid aliens, whose powers are used to defend and shape the progress of the native life. After thousands of years hidden amongst us, the Eternals are called back into action when a Deviant, long thought to be defeated, arrives in London.This is, I think, going to be one of my reviews where I say that generally I thought something was OK, but then only list a series of things I didn't like about it. So to try and fill out the positives a bit, I do like the world building of this one and how to points us in the direction of some new characters for the MCU to utilise and where things might go for an Eternals sequel.Issue one is that it's too long, way too long, perhaps even as much as an hour too long. I never felt the running time in ""Endgame"" but I really did here, perhaps that's down to too many repeating story beats, or the plot not moving along fast enough, but either way this is the first time, with a Marvel film, I've felt that it's this length because they felt it ought to be, rather than because it actually needs to be.My second issue is also with the story, there's no audience proxy to get us into what's happening. Kit Harrington's character does it a little bit, but then he's sidelined - from there we're shown in multiple flashbacks about the history of the characters, and what's driven them to the point they are at now but it always feels like . . . Secondhand information, rather than something we're learning for ourselves. The best example I can give of this, without too hefty a spoiler, is that we're told that Sprite has always been in love with another character, but we're not (to my mind) shown any hints of that before we're told. There are also a lot of characters to be introduced to in this film and perhaps because of that some of the Eternals and the deviant leader, Kro, are underwritten.And finally, just whilst I'm on the subject of the Deviants, I didn't like them. I thought the CGI work was subpar and the character designs were uninspired. I think I'd have preferred something more akin to the comics, with an actual actor playing the role. Particularly when the character turns out to have little consequence to the overall story.As I say, generally I though the film was OK, with a second half much improved over the first. I think the future for the Eternals looks much brighter now this first film is out of the way, especially if they can get involved with a more intergalactic story, rather than an Earth based one. I'm sure I'll watch this again at some point, but for now it's just scratching an itch on the way to Spiderman."
2232,10,"Excited for the next movie and the reason is Eros! I love the movie. It's amazing! But I admit it's not what I expected, it's MORE than what I expected. Even though the movie was amazing, I was looking forward to the post-credit scene. I didn't believe it until I saw it myself. I was taken aback by the fact that Harry freaking styles is in the movie and that he has a big role in the next movie too. I still really can't put my head together on the fact that the ugly-looking pig-face Thanos,(no offense to Thanos and people who like him) has such a swoon-worthy handsome hottie brother who looks like it's a piece of meat for him to make people like him. (and that's entirely true) But jokes aside, I think that Thanos was how he was because of his brother. Well, maybe not entirely because of his brother, but still, there's a chance that it could've been the reason. Because I'm a person who has very well experienced that feeling. And I also have a gut feeling that Eros might've got something to do with Thanos snapping away half of the Universe.Aside from Eros, I liked the role Thena played by Angelina Jolie, she was so fierce and daring and I love such bold woman characters, and even though he was a bit of a villain, I loved Richard Madden's role Ikaris too. Others were also good.I'm also looking forward to Kit Harrington's Black Knight.Well, I think that's it. As I said before, I love the movie. Y'all should go and watch it. So sorry for the itty bitty spoilers.Now looking back, I think this was more of a review of Thanos and his family. Lol. Sorry for that too. This is WAY more than I thought... Anyway, people who reached up to this, Thank You."
2233,3,"Worst Marvel movie so far. Disjointed. Lacks continuity.Spent too much on visuals and forgot how to make a coherent story to go with the visuals.The actors all did a great job but the story, screenplay, writing, character development all seemed a bit like a one dimensional action film from the 1970s or 1980s.Flashbacks were way overdone.The science is not explained to a believable level. It's a child's action movie.I pray this isn't a sign of things to come for future marvel movies."
2234,10,"A great non-typical marvel movie! Saw the movie last night and really enjoyed it ! It really is different from the other past marvel movies with more humane touch , and in my options is good with diverse characters . Great scope of the universe and stunning cinematography.Fighting actions are impressive as well.It's definitely one of my top five marvels ( have seen them all )."
2235,6,"Way too long! This movie was unnecessarily long honestly you could cut out about 40 minutes of the movie and about 3 characters. I really like that the MCU are trying to introduce some new hero's since the originals are slowly dropping from the universe and honestly it's needed, but some of these characters are just bland and not fleshed out enough. I feel like they just dumped way too much information about brand new characters all at once and it's abit much to care about all of them at once, it just doesn't feel like a marvel movie. The deviants are a little bit boring in terms of villains and again they aren't given enough time in screen for us to care who they are. The effects in this might be some of the best in a marvel movie and I really like some of the costume design on the characters, some of them are a little similar looking at first but for the end fight scene they look really unique and interesting. I love that this film introduces more celestials as they are some of the coolest characters in the marvel universe and they look amazing in this movie and I can't wait to see more of them I'm future films. The end credit scenes are pretty exciting and they do keep me excited for future films. I just wish this movie had a few more things going for it because there's not really much else to say, it's just a little bland with some cool ideas that would have worked better over a couple of movies instead of all crammed into one. Definitely not the worst MCU movie but not the best either!"
2236,6,"Doesn't feel like Marvel While this is far from the worst movie Marvel has ever released, there's nothing that makes this film stand out. The characters don't bring anything new to the table and it felt like I was watching a documentary instead of an action movie. I like what it sets up for the future of the MCU but in a vacuum this movie was just very bland."
2237,10,"Wonderful surprising and visually different I went into this movie trying for to watch too many trailers. I wasn't overly excited at the idea of it but girl did I dig what I saw.Although it tackled some old ground I felt it did it in a new way. It was much more a character piece than a building smashing feat which is exactly what I would always hope for.Visually stunning, moving and very surprising. The end let me decide if the decisions each character made was right or wrong. Right and wrong wasn't jammed down my throat. So thank you to the film makers.This film didn't feel completely American. Visually there was styles from the whole world of cinema. I enjoyed this film. I'm sure I sound like an idiot with my pour critic skills but I just want to encourage others to see this film, it didn't feel totally like your standard marvel episode."
2238,4,"Felt like an eternity So the third film in the next ""phase"" for the MCU and, after being massively underwhelmed by black widow, and enjoying Shang chi, but feeling it didn't seem like a marvel movie at all I was slightly concerned as I'd seen the early reviews about this film and how it hadn't been well received, I didn't really have a great knowledge of the Eternals characters from the comics, but had a basic idea about who they were but wanted to go in with an open mind and be my normal Marvel fanboy self.However, right from the off this film just didn't grab me, and two and a half hours later (though it felt a LOT longer) I still felt no connection to these characters or any feelings towards any of them. Don't get me wrong, there are good things in this film, and it didn't bother me that they gender swapped some characters from the comics or ticked the ethnicity boxes with the castings, but the negatives are what stand out more for me. The cast was great, but I found a lot the acting to be pretty poor in this film, James madden starts off very wooden and does punt get much better throughout, and Gemma Chan looks terrified in every scene she's in (it also annoyed me more than it should that they cast her in another role since she'd already starred as Minerva in captain marvel). Salma Hayek is hardly in the movie and Angelina Jolie is very much a background character who mainly stands around staring in to space. The characters don't seem that interested in the film, which makes it hard to invest yourself in it, and also the global extinction event of earth ""birthing a celestial"" is so huge that at no point do you think it's actually going to happen, this sort of thing would have worked better as an overarching story for the whole phase rather than being crammed in to one film - also, if the celestials created the Eternals, why did they give them the powers and capabilities to kill them?!Understandably there had to be a lot of exposition to give you the knowledge of these characters but even the flashbacks and action sequences aren't interesting because they are just a standard faceless enemy that they are fighting in the deviants, who you aren't given much information on other than a couple of lines about their origins, but nothing about why they've suddenly reappeared despite being wiped out hundreds of years ago, and why the ""big bad"" deviant can suddenly take on the powers one Eternals that he kills?Overall I just found this film to be very slow and dull and I really wanted to like this film but couldn't. But I worry for the new film projects that they seem to be teasing, especially with the mid-credits scenes for black knight (that well known and beloved marvel character), yet they are wasting moon knight and she hulk on Disney+ series when I feel these would be much better movies.And one last nail in the coffin for this film - that mid credit scene - firstly, pip the troll is some of the worst CGI I've seen in a while, but mostly - Harry Styles? Really? If this is the one direction the MCU is going in then count me out."
2239,6,"The Most Ambitious MCU Movie ever and not lived up to it. Hear me out , the single most disconnection in the Movie for me is I couldn't connect with the characters well .Yes the story is in slow pan and we are jumping through the decades in mere few minutes sometimes seconds ,just when I thought I was getting what's in the mind of the characters and understanding them BOOM flashback, or to the present.I think the single element that could make the movie OK to great and perfect would be making this Disney+ or making the runtime to 3hours or more because like I said this story is very ambitious and have the moral and ethical questions and the Character Development would so great than that we got which is the weakest point of the film, So we could connect to the characters more.What do I mean I couldn't connect with characters is Why The specific Eternal is connected to the things on the Planet and why loves specifically the other Eternal. For Example Why Gilgamesh wanted to protect and live with Thena & Mikkari and Druig adore each other (By the Mikkari expressions were adorable and the way she looked at him ,should have got at least more than few seconds) . Having more screen time with the characters would make me connect with them and also would make Great Character Development. And also Thena was the weak character and I was greatly disappointed I thought she was gonna be fearsome warrior and be awesome.Still the movie has great things like Cinematography, CGI Styling and the Art Director did a great job. The Character Karun Patel is great comic relief. And I'm still eager to revisit the characters again.I'm really sad the movie getting the reception it is (maybe rightfully so, IDK) had the potential to be not just one of the Greatest Comic Book Movie but one of the Greatest Movie."
2240,5,An Ok watch The movie was all over the place and hard to understand. It also lacked in character development however the cinematography was excellent. The characters where cool and unique but most lacked a storyline. Best/most intriguing scenes where the post credit scene with the Kit Harrington and Harry Styles.
2241,3,"Trying to do too much in 2 and a half hours I'm not super into the MCU anymore. I didn't want to see this movie, but my friend bought me a ticket so I decided to go see it with him. I sat through the entire movie bored and confused at what was happening and why. They started setting up all the eternals super hurriedly, and spent the rest of the movie trying to finish setting them up through the entire movie, and character motivations were introduced, but then they wouldn't really go anywhere, some characters would die and it was hard to care because we barely had any time to get to know them. The humor was ok, but often a bit out of place. The characters' powers also weren't clearly defined so it was hard to really understand everything they could do. Probably my least favorite part though was the villain had potential to be super interesting, but his motivations were wasted on a character that was way too powerful for his own good. It seemed like he couldn't be harmed or beaten, and even when it seemed like he met his match later on in the movie, he just breaks free of whatever restraints were holding him and goes to confront the ""main character"" if you could call her that. This movie didn't know what it was doing. It was rushed, bland, uninteresting, and was riddled with so many plot holes that were even apprentice from watching the movie once. Not recommended, stay far away. In fact stop watching MCU movies. They're not that good."
2242,10,Mature film! The most mature films and different from mcu movies. The characters are unique. You really feel that their relationship are real. The cinematography are amazing. Most amazing in mcu! The presentation of this movie is great! You really can feel that you're part of them. The diversity of this movie are amazing! You really can say that representation matters! Chloe Zhao did a great job!
2243,5,"Not a bad movie, but wrong genre categories I went in expecting something which wasn't - and that's the main reason for my 5 star rating. Remove Action and Adventure as a genre, and I'd give this a solid 7.The movie is indeed very slow, with a lot of dialogue, and a lot of D&M moments. Whilst the cast don't really gel with each other that much, I don't feel they need to, considering their back story and that it's not really what this movie is about.I recommend this movie for the story lines are not as bad as some may make them out to be. The acting is on point with the each character and the roles they play.You'll be disappointed though if you're going in for some top action sequences and a feeling of adventure - this makes up maybe 10% of the movie, which is not much when the whole thing is 2.5hrs long."
2244,1,"One of the worst .... This must been one of the worst movies I ever have seen and after 40 years of watching movies this states something. After one hour in most of the people from out party just wanted to leave. Eternal is missing any form cohesion or flow. Some of the visual effect are good but this states clearly that trowing a lot of money to a movies doesn't make it any good. And then I don't want to start over the actors. They want to make it global and having to touch all the factions but they missed miserably. Maybe it would be a decent tv- series (after a good rework) but this is just awful, just afwul ... just avoid!"
2245,9,"Great movie different from any MCU project 10 character in 7000 years it was, it was a lot to cover, should have been a show or split in two but it was still great, I enjoyed it. The cinematography was amazing, the story was a type fit but I think it worked. It expanded the marvel universe so much."
2246,5,Canned Superhero Movie Really tough movie to get into. Some fun moments and beautiful scenes to be sure but they were overshadowed by a forced narrative that didn't feel organic. I'd rank this at the bottom of the MCU next to The Incredible Hulk. Spoiler alert: the Eternals get attached to the people of earth but for some reason didn't feel the same way for the other countless civilizations they had the same mission for. What made the others so not special?
2247,7,"Average super hero movie Within all the DC and Marvel movies, I would think this movie is average. I'm not saying it's not a good movie, but it's not outstanding, no big ""wow"". Some characters seem like not necessary to the main story line, maybe it's due to the cut. But more detailed back stories of each eternal would be good, otherwise, I can't feel the love they have to each other, and can't feel angry when they betrayed each other or sad when they die..."
2248,10,"A Movie Deserving of a Far Better Reception Before the release of Eternals, it was being review bombed. While there are legitimate critiques to make of the movie, a majority was the result of the depiction of gay characters upsetting easily upset people who can't handle those sorts of depictions.I saw the movie on opening day. While I felt that a good portion of the first act of the movie wasn't done well, and even poorly, it changed course and was a very fun and engaging ride for the remainder. Though most moght turn away from the thought of watching the movie long enough to see, if at all, thanks to the backlash from ""anti-cancel culture"" bigots trying to cancel it."
2249,7,"Different from most marvel movies Better storyline than typical, but less fun as well. Better than the bs endgame story tho. Jolie kinda sucked & shoulda never been cast in this role. My gf fell asleep, but to be fair it was really long lol."
2250,7,"Yeah, Eternal's origins are different I heard this movie was not great and a lot of critics made negative comments about the film, but I didn't listen to them. I still went and watched the movie. And I thought this movie was ok. It wasn't awful or terribly negative, etc...etc.. No. This is not true and it's ridiculous. In my opinion, this movie was ok and it had a good start, it's not equal to, or like the other MCU movies. It's pretty different because it's refreshing and its origins are new. People need to understand this. The reason why I say it was ok is because I don't like movies that have stories with flashback scenes. I admit I hate flashback scenes, but it also depends on the story. For example, in the movie Titanic, the movie had flashback scenes there weren't that many. The movie began with an old woman describing her story about her experiences and what happened on the Titanic. Then the flashback scene took us back to when she was young on the Titanic. It's just a one-time flashback and it continued to the end. That's the type of flashback that I like. There are not too many flashbacks, with many characters in the movie, Eternals. It's easy for me to fall asleep and it is boring. But this is just my opinion. Also, the movie is pretty long with a lot of dialogue. The amount of dialogue should be cut. I think this movie was good with the storyline, cinematography, and it had awesome special effects. Also, I really like this movie because it had a lot of diversity. That's basically it, and I give it a 7 out of 10 stars. This movie will return for part 2. I hope it will better than part 1. By the way, don't leave because the movie has two post credits in the end. You will happy."
2251,2,Retread actors trying to use Marvel to kick start their dying career Let me just say that the movie would've been fine if they cut out one of the redundant fight scenes.The dudes smooching Recast Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie.Salma was atrocious! Totally didn't sell herself as an immortal powerful being. Whiny and annoying Angelina Jolie is just oh so tough with the stoic poses. Give me a break. I didn't seem them as Ajak and Athena. Ohh no drop the A!
2252,1,God awful waste of time. Horrible and pointless. Worst superhero movie maybe worst movie ever. So many super hero fake tears and expository blah blah blah.There was an audible laugh in the theater when one superhero surprised another then another surprised the former. I'm sure that was not the intended effect. Awful.$12 bucks you'll never get back and two hours you could have spent on your phone.
2253,5,"I really wanted to like it. I cared nothing about these characters and I really wanted to. I wanted to like this film, but the story was too bland which didn't do the characters any favors.I'll give it another shot once it's available to stream at home, because truth be told, I wasn't a fan of GOTG at first viewing either and now I love that movie.So my opinion can change.In Feige We Trust."
2254,5,Not the worst movie ever I know we all love Marvel but not my favorite movie because of not enough character development. I think Chloé Zhao should have taken more time. Hopefully in number 2 it will be much better and hopefully more character development in the next movie and I did not expect Gemma Chan to carry the movie I honestly though Salma Hayek would carry the movie.
2255,9,"It's up to the viewer I personally loved the movie; I loved the storyline, diverse characters and their chemistry and the visuals are just amazing. If you like a more complex storyline and a build-up of the plot, then this movie is for you! My only criticism is that I did lose my concentration closer to the climax of the film, but the end fight scene really made up for it."
2256,3,"Worst Marvel movie Yet I have loved watching all the Marvel movies and I know how good they are, by how many ties I watch them. But Eternals, I will never watch again. The story was slow, frustrating and disappointing. I don't think it was cast correctly as it was like hammed up acting and the interactions between some cast were like read of a script. The thought process of taking out a Celestial by an Eternal just defied logic and to me unbalanced the characters within the Marvel Universe. Certainly great effects, but long periods of irrelevant actions and some dumb jokes. For example breaking a table, thinking it was vibranium... duh, how smart are these people meant to be. Anyway its worth a watch, but leave your brain at home."
2257,8,"I had high expectations for this film and they were met! The visual effects are definitely the most awe-inducing factor of the movie, along with the cinematography. I loved everything about the fight scenes, from the choreographies to the technology and powers. The soundtrack is a bit confusing sometimes, it alternates beautiful pieces of music to melodies that sound disconnected. I don't know how to feel about it. The characters are likeable and diverse. The jokes are sometimes a bit too much. The LGBTQ+ representation is a breath of fresh air in a franchise such as Marvel. I liked that the main character is not one of the big names in the cast. Still, I feel like they could have used Angelina Jolie more. I was also a bit disappointed that Kit Harington didn't have as much screen time as one might deduce from the trailer. Overall I think the story was very clear despite the multiple flashbacks, and I'm relieved that I didn't leave the theatre feeling like I missed something or had questions left unanswered. I would have liked the film to be just a little shorter with some adjustments to the pacing. The two post-credit scenes are very exciting!"
2258,8,"Easy to tell that these 1 star reviews are fake This was a good movie. Finally something different. I liked all the characters. I don't need a back story for each character. That would make the movie 18 hours long. Externals were put on Earth to grow the population, by protecting them, but not from each other so they can evolve and populate, for a bigger purpose. That's all I need to know. All these 1 star reviews are from people who should have stayed home and colored in their coloring books."
2259,7,This Movie is cool and worth the watch! This movie was a solid Marvel movie . Don't let people tell you it's bad. It's not epic but it's good. Any action movie fan will like this movie. There certisn parts that were confusing and all the obvious inclusion was annoying. Angela Jolie character was a little weak. The powers that they have makes you wonder why they don't do more for mankind. The back story for the characters should be stronger as well. I'm interested in knowing more about there backstop because that would be great.
2260,7,"Good Enough Film in the MCU I had a good time watching Eternals. It wasn't the best film I've seen, but I have a lot of respect for the effort to make this.Eternals has the humor, top-notch special effects, and references that make it an MCU movie.The notes that worked in this film are the humor, VFX, stunning visuals, and fight scenes. The notes I think need improvement are the character development, the runtime, and understanding of character motivations."
2261,3,"The worst MCU movie, this is coming from an MCU fan. It's like someone took the Joss Whedon cut of Justice League, and said ""Needs more talking."" None of it matters to the MCU as a whole, and nobody coming out of the movie will remember the characters' names except for maybe Sprite and Icarus. The CGI fighting is the only redeemable part of this movie.It is the only MCU movie with a sex scene. Why does it need one? Hell if I know. The making out immediately before it was _quite_ long, after about 4 seconds of sucking face you get the picture.There are a LOT of plot holes, the director has only directed realistic fiction in ""independent films"", and it frickin' shows. My guess is that Chloe Zhao never watched the rest of the MCU. I watched Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, and the scriptwriter hadn't seen any of the 6+ gundam shows since 1994 for a show that she was writing in 2014, so I can safely say that this kinda thing has happened before.The Eternals movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes, and it has about 90 minutes of pointless dialogue. None of it matters, this felt like a ""genocide is bad"" movie written by a fourth grader that has never worked retail or been in a fistfight, let alone see the actual reality of war or seen even a basic documentary about how fascists rise to power.The action is tropey, but the plot holes are worse.Action scenes are basically coin flips to decide whether a hit will be substantial or just another jab.You will wonder how powerful these Eternals are if SHOTGUNS AND RIFLES are used as a semi decent weapon against the Deviants, and ""the most powerful"" Eternal can't hit the broad side of a barn.The pool where green lady falls in goes from 25 feet deep to 2 feet deep.Angelina's character is a robot and somehow the Celestial forgot to reset her properly? The Celestial knows what happens on Earth and doesn't immediately know when the Eternals rebel?Why were the Deviants created? How come the one Deviant is basically Cell and absorbs eternals?Why was the special deviant killed off in a scene that is very similar to Luke killing the Wompa in Star Wars ep 5?The crazy sickness that affects Angelina Jolie's character is a subplot of a subplot that goes nowhere.My mother pointed out that ""after the fourth time of 'We've gotta go back', I thought it was a little much"". No, seriously, that phrase comes up a LOT.TLDR 3/10, the only good thing about this movie was the decent acting during the fight scenes, the Celestial, the intelligent Deviant and the CGI."
2262,9,"Well I loved it I'm not sure why Eternals got bashed I understood Black Widow hate more. This was so good cinematically especially in IMAX, acting was astonishing, and colors were all glorious! The story might be the only bumpy aspect even that I enjoyed for a Marvel film it's really solid even deserves rewards definitely had a lot of Chloe Zhao vibes that reminded me of Nomadland. I loved Eternals I'd highly recommend despite anything I think it's worth it!Side note:There was a hot mom in the audience that was a bonus though."
2263,8,I liked it I really liked this movie but I feel like it should have been two parts. I found the characters fascinating however I felt too much was pushed into the story. I felt like k wanted more but I still really liked it.
2264,8,"ETERNALS SPOILER REVIEW Eternals spoiler reviewPositive:each character was extremely likable and they were instantly all very interesting. Each character got the right amount of screen time and moments. My personal favorites were makkari, druig, and kingo. Makkari was an amazing speedster it was so cool having it that when she ran fast everything else moved just as fast so we really got to see how everything interacted with her while she was moving fast. While some humor felt out of place a lot of the jokes landed for me and I really feel like each eternal bounced off of each other very well and their chemistry was amazing. The action while fairly spread out was always enjoyable and any action scene with thena or makkari was so much fun to watch. And everytime a celestial was on screen my jaw was on the floor their inclusion was very much needed. This was the second marvel movie to almost make me cry. It's emotional moments really hit differently. The twist with ikaris blew me away and despite it being sad watching him fight his family I understand his intentions. I loved the relationship between gilgamesh and thena it was so endearing. I like that kingo didn't want to have to fight ikaris so he left. It was much more than just a pointless sidelining of a character. Ajak did such a good job as the ""mom"" of the group and it made sersi becoming the leader very worth it. Really the best parts were the characters interacting they really all nailed their parts. And kingos introduction was amazing. Without w doubt the coolest action sequence was that of the eternals fighting ikaris. Oh and one more thing the score was amazing. And this felt so different from anything we've seen in MCU and I'm so excited to see where they take it. Also the cinematography in this movie was probably some of the best in the entire MCU. It was beautiful and some of the shots were magnificent.Negatives: first off the deviants were a joke of a villain. They were all so easily disposed of except for of course the head one who did feel threatening until thena shit on him. I wish he ended up surviving so he could become a bigger threat in a potential sequel. And by the end they didn't even feel important because the eternals also had to fight off Ikaris which became the the real threat. This movie makes so many things that have happened in the MCU feel so small compared to the scale of this. It felt a little weird killing off ajak and Gilgamesh early in the movie. I also didn't really like how they kept going back to thousands of years ago. It did good to establish how they had to deal with the human conflicts and not be able to interfere but it just got tedious. Finally I wish they had given ajak more screen time to really flesh out her relationship with every eternal to make her death feel meaningful. I thought the whole side plot with sprite being in love ikaris was weird. I enjoyed her wanting to be a real person so she could live a normal life but adding in her being in love with ikaris was just uncomfortable.Consensus: with amazing characters, fun action, awesome score, and goofy humor eternals is definitely worth a watch. While it had a pretty mid villain it definitely accomplished what it was trying to do. To be different. And I have so much respect for that. And omg we are actually getting Eros in the MCU I am so so excited for his upcoming projects. Star moments for me were the characters interacting and the action which is unlike anything we've seen so far. It's not for everyone and trust me when people say it doesn't feel like a marvel movie they are definitely right. Don't go in expecting the same old thing. I thought it was great and did a number of things right while still having a few issues. Cause nothings perfect and this movie doesn't try to be. It establishes many new characters and makes us excited for what's right come. Very enjoyable and worth the watch and I am very pumped to see Danes return as the black knight. And I have one more thing to say. MCU earth is complete and utterly. Arishem is comingCharacters:9/10Story: 9/10Cinematography:10/10Action: 8/10Ending:7/10Humor:8/10Overall:8/10."
2265,7,Noot good as Marvel previous movies Well it just deserves 7 stars.. It wasn't so good. It began little slow and the beginning was little boring. It isn't at all Marvel Best movie as marvel said.
2266,10,"Finally a good Marvel movie - with a different approach The Eternals is a good adventure movie with a different pacing, style and cinematography.Interestingly, it does have way more gravity than previous dozen ones and a more interesting storyline that works with some pre-knowledge of legends.Luckily, it is only sometimes cringeworthy and other than the first few minutes and some unnecessary jokes it is an enjoyable cinematic experience. Well, dialogues don't live up to the movie for sure, on the other hand, the whole concept (and the undeniable borrowing from the DC Universe) works just as the actors.Even Angeline Jolie turned to be a good choice and Salma Hayek luckily wasn't too much. True, the lesser known actors are carrying the show instead of the leads but that's totally ok and enjoyable.The Eternals has 4 major parts and the pacing makes the long running time easy to watch.It is definitely not the common ""Marvel movie"" - that formula was exhausted long ago. If one pays attention everything makes sense - sometimes good to think of a story and put the puzzle together; being said it's not a mindless action orgy, although the action segments are well crafted.The soundtrack is a good addition, not taking the attention away from what is important.If not a few scenes, this could have been a great standalone sci-fi/fantasy/tale, too.Have an open-mind and just enjoy something new, fresh and good."
2267,8,"My husband stayed awake My husband hates the Marvel movies. Complains of the repeated tropes. I dragged him to all of them and he went because he loves me; still he fell asleep in them. With the release of Shang Chi and the Externals, he stayed awake. The introduction of story telling and character building is a new direction for Marvel. This is what probably irritates most true fans. The road to change is and will always be a difficult one. I think this what most people need to remember when reading the 1- stars reviews."
2268,5,"Very average. Just wait to see it on home release. Echo the sentiments of what all other people that rated it in a similar vein to me have said. For some random superhero movie it was fine, but for the money Marvel pumps into these projects, it certainly missed the mark by a long shot. A 1/10 is a little harsh, the film is just very average for sure.The characters all felt very one dimensional, purely as a result of trying to establish too many backstories in the one film. I'd agree that they certainly wasted some of the characters.The action/combat scenes did feel like filler scenes. Yes you can argue this may have not been the purpose given the movies underlying objective in establishing new characters/a new story, but for casual/semi Marvel fans that go for the traditional Marvel blockbuster goodness, I'd wait to see it at home."
2269,1,"Worst kind of superhero movie I usually do not rate movie titles, but I really had to write about this one. Being a fan to the franchise, the Marvel Universe have really gone down to the lowest level of writings with this one. Why did they have to create such a mess? I wish I had gone with my gut feelings about skipping this one, but I went in anyways after checking 6.9 IMDB rating reluctantly.Writing is a backbone of any movie and CGI is a branch of that spine. With this one: CGI seemed to be the main course and Story was merely a single topping on it. Save yourself from the troubles of watching it in the theatre. Wait for it to release in Disney+, so you can at least change the channel."
2270,8,"Eternals: diverse cast and characters rewrite human history. 77.5% This new entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is the origin story of a group of extraterrestrials known as ""Eternals"", who have been on Earth for millennia, sent here to protect humans from a deadly threat known as ""Deviants"", which are beasts that prey on them. Then things get complicated. If you've been watching the MCU entries and wondering why you haven't seen or heard of them before, well, the film does explain that, which you may find more or less plausible. Or not. The Eternals look like humans but they just have superhero kinds of powers. And they never age, which kind of makes sense, given that they're called...The breadth of this film is epic, covering the dawn of human civilisation to the present day, I suppose you'd call it or, at least, after ""The Blip"", which occurred in ""Avengers: Infinity war"". That being said, as an origin story, there is no need to be familiar with previous MCU films in order to feel confident watching this one, as it's a stand-alone outing.An interesting aspect to this film is how it offers an alternative myth to the rise of humans as well as implying that myths and legends which exist in our actual history are wrong. The names of the Eternals play on this notion, with characters called Ikarus (played by Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie) to name but a few. Given how American Christians have protested against 'Satanic' heavy metal music or even Harry Potter, for goodness sake, I'm surprised that they haven't protested against this film for challenging biblical accounts of the nature of the universe!Now, seeing how these Eternals are depicted as advancing human civilisation over millennia, I suppose that could make one roll one's eyes in disappointment. Maybe I did this initially but I just submitted to the myth and went along for the ride. At the back of my mind, however, was the thought that this depiction patronised humans. If Marvel's counter-myth, which short-changes the ingenuity of humans offends, well, at least be calmed by the knowledge that the works of William Shakespeare aren't attributed to any of the Eternals!I can't say that seeing this film was something that I was keen to do but I did come across some information somewhere that it was (or would be) directed by Academy Award winning director Chloé Zhao, a woman who grew up in China (she is the first Asian woman to win an Academy Award for direction). Even though I hadn't seen any of her previous films, that titbit was enough of a lure for me to see the film, out of curiosity at least. It was a punt which I'm glad I took, in contrast to a similar scenario, which was also in the MCU, where another Academy Award winning director Ang Lee (a man who was born in Taiwan) directed ""Hulk"". That Lee film was quite a disappointment to me (I'd say that I saw that before I began reviewing films on the original ""The movie show"" website and then moved to this site when SBS closed their website). It was conceivable to me that I would also find Zhao's film pretentious and underwhelming but she's done a solid job here. Seeing a trailer for this film recently, it didn't look promising on the comedy front at least, with that scene where an Eternal breaks a table. It looked like humour aimed at very small children. However, I can say that I did laugh other times, so the humour improved (I especially liked the inside humour about online video creators).If you've seen the two most recent ""Avengers"" films and the opinions of supervillain Thanos gave you pause for thought, well, you might like the direction that ""Eternals"" goes into, as it takes this to a whole 'nother level, perhaps, with the character of Arishem.Anyway, I enjoyed this film but I don't think that I'd make a point of seeing it again and I might not be interested in seeing any sequels (unless, maybe, Zhao also directs it and...the Avengers aren't in it, perhaps). This MCU outing had a diverse cast and diverse characters. A minor gripe for me though was finding it hard to understand dialogue on some occasions, either because of accents or the use of audio effects, like that used for the voice of Arishem.The following are just random observations for my own benefit:* Is it weird that Eternals are extraterrestrial in origin yet are otherwise like humans? I mean, I assume that humans can interbreed with them!* Is it weird that the extraterrestrial Eternals have sex in the missionary position?* Is it weird that these supreme Eternal beings include the deaf amongst their ranks?* One Eternal, ""Sprite"" (Lia McHugh) reminded me of a similar character in ""Interview with the vampire"" (I think...my memory could be faulty here). Why is there such a young Eternal? What's that all about?* I was also wondering about the point of the Deviants but if I imagined them to be the inspiration for the concept of ""demons"", they didn't bother me so much.* One of Ikarus' superpowers reminded me of Superman...this is referenced later on in the film.* One part which I found to be unbelievable was where early humans take up arms against obviously much more powerful Eternals...which have just helped them. That didn't ring true to me...for those two reasons.* Product placement and endorsement by Eternals was quite marked. I counted two such scenes. How about you?* One scene was presented as being in Australia...I had my doubts about this, for some reason.* Climate change is brought up in the narrative.* Lastly, I found the Eternals' frequent ruminations on what makes humans worth saving insipid.* Lastly, lastly, my scoring for this film was tracking at 75% (7 out of 10 stars here), then 75+% (8 out 10 stars) then my final score of 77.5%."
2271,5,"Dark And I don't mean in a thematic way. I could barely make out what was going on some of the time. The action sequences may have been brilliant for all I know. The effects may have been magnificent, but why did it all seem to take place in the middle of the night?"
2272,3,"I enjoyed the last 30 minutes... the rest was a dulll mess :( Honestly, the very worst marvel movie I've ever seen. Terrible pace, extremely boring story, bad casting, stiff acting, unimaginative dull directing. Chloe Zhan obviously has extreme talent as a director, but not this genre. Who ever decided she would be a good fit for a marvel movie made a huge error. Thankfully the remaining 30 minutes of the movie were very enjoyable. If I was you I would read the synopsis and head to the cinema towards the end of the movie and just watch the final 30 minutes as there's no need to watch the first 2 hours in my opinion. You won't miss anything."
2273,1,"200 Million Dollar Soap Opera I have a pretty high threshold for generic storytelling in a blockbuster movie nowadays. I get it, its more about having a fun experience. But this movie was just too much. I found myself looking at my watch over and over again waiting for it to be over. So many convoluted story branches and forced relationship tensions. It seriously a superhero soap opera! Including TWO stupid love triangles! The main character was bland and the story is so distracted that you can hardly call her a main character. You are constantly jumping from time period to time period, the ""twists"" are so predictable and cliche I was just angry they didn't reveal them earlier so we could wrap up the boring story. So much of this movie just felt like a corporate checklist going down the line of things that a modern superhero movie should have, not even trying to accomplish a real engaging storyline.Avoid this movie. Don't reward this behavior."
2274,9,"Something totaly new. It was a very good movie. I have been a fan for a long time, and it was something special. Very diffrent cast many diversity. Some people thought the time changing with past and future in the beginning was annoying but is was their for a reason. You Can't look at this like the new Avengers movie, even with the first Avengers movie there were already other movies with backstory's. In etarnals they had to cover a lot of ground and I think they did a good job at it. You don't need to see any other Marvel movie to get the point, What I remeber they only talk about it maybe 2 or 3 times. I am for sure going to watch this movie again and suggest that you do to. (And if you don't like the movie try watching it again with a fresh mind)."
2275,8,"Great movie and among the best within the MCU As a movie by itself it is great, but when compared to every other Marvel movie, this is among the best, despite what all the haters say.That doesn't mean this is a masterpiece or that it is perfect, but I could also name a bunch of other Marvel movies that lag behind Eternals, which has an amazing cast, outstanding cinematography and a more mature and darker story.Seems like people just wanna watch mindless action and don't like the philosophical aspect of the movie."
2276,1,"The bad reviews were right. Before I start, I want to make it clear that besides watching the trailers, I went into the film completely blind. I haven't read the source material (just got the Neil Gaiman miniseries of Eternals, will get to reading that soon), and haven't seen the director's previous Oscar-Winning film (Nomadland) or any of her previous films.And yet, despite having no expectations for Phase 4, I still think this is the most disappointing film of 2021, even more so than Black Widow.I should mention that this film tries to be different from the other films in the way that it's shot (more practical sets, shooting on location, less green screen) and honestly, it looks beautiful. I honestly want Marvel to keep going down this route.Ramin Djawadi's score is pretty good and unique and it's so nice to see Iron Man's composer reunite with the MCU. I would have preferred Alexandre Desplat but Djawadi score makes for an epic listen.The writing sucks. It's one of the most boring films I've seen; compared to Valerian and Jupiter Ascending, it's not bad but it comes really close. The characters feel one-note, they don't have that much depth to them, and they're not well developed; to the point where I can't remember a single character from this film compared to other perfect MCU Ensemble Films like Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2 or Avengers 1. This might be due to the film having too many protagonists in it. You could have cut some of them out of the film and left them for later films and nothing much would have been lost.The acting is the dullest in the entire MCU. All of the actors felt like they brought no personality or chemistry to the table whatsoever and none of their performances felt memorable; it's even worse than Brie Larson in Captain Marvel. I don't know if they were miscast, were give bad direction, were given a terrible script or all of the above but fact still remains that they were completely unnmemmorable and wasted in this film. The only ones that felt like they were at least trying were Barry Keoghan, Bryan Tyree Henry, Kit Harrington (who isn't even in the film that much), Richard Madden, Lauren Ridloff and even Bill Skarsgard (who voices Kro); these actors felt like they had emotions apart from dull surprise.The pacing is also different from the other MCU films as it's much slower and more contemplative. Unfortunately, that also harms the film unintentionally as nothing much happens in both action scenes and quieter moments. Scenes also feel like they're just stitched together with no connection to the next scene tying them together, making for some pretty bad editing.1/10 with one extra star for the visuals. Oh well, next."
2277,10,Best marvel movie for me I'll start with: this movie probably isn't for you if you expect marvel formula and action scenes that get bigger and bigger. It is completely different from every other mcu movie and that's really refreshing and something that should happen more often.The movie explores the life of the eternals and their personal change over thousands of years. It shines with its ability of putting different beings into the spotlight of becoming humans and explores the variety of characters that are formed over the years. This movie with multiple characters is more intimate and tragic than every other mcu movie out there that features only one main character. Zhao manages to draw beautiful characters in such a short time and combined with her teams skill in cinematography and the actors ability to act every nuance of the characters she manages to bring an incredible experience of a movie onto the screen that I hope we will see more frequent in the next few years.
2278,9,"Change in the formula This is refreshing to have a film using another formula than the usual fight-jokes-fight we usually get.I don't mind the formula for some of them but lately some of the last movies are just that (antman 1&2,cpt marvel, black widow, falcon and the winter soldier) and don't bring anything new.Marvel is also that, movies that can go beyond that despite the mold like civil war, thor 3, inifity war, endgame... Here we have a film slow or rather slower than usual for a marvel, with less fight but focusing more on characters, characters that are never boring, characters that I would love to see again unlike characters like cpt marvel, baby black widow or falcon who are only meh characters.Some characters like antman are nice but only have more than average movies."
2279,1,"waste of good talent How can anyone give this movie a good rating is beyond me. Movie has no substance, a deranged some one might call a plot. And 15 minutes of action in a 2-1/2 hour movie, rest of which is total boring. So they advertise 5 minutes of action to try to sell a real flop imo. I wasted my money to see this movie. Anybody that reads my reviews knows I hate to give really low reviews, i really have to dislike a movie a lot in order to give only one star."
2280,5,"Enjoyable but... Frustrating film. Are these characters superheroes or gods or demigods or robots or angels? Who knows, who' cares, right? I dug it mostly but the flaws are almost too many to list.I'll start with the actors. Kumail Nanjiani (Kingo), Bryan Tyree Henry (Phastos), and Ma Dong-seok (Gilgamesh) are the only characters that I felt worked. The leads were all flat, especially Gemma Chan (Sersi) and Richard Madden (Ikaris). Angelina Jolie (Athena) is underused, and Kit Harrington is barely in the film. The others are mostly forgettable. For a film about characters, the lack of real chemistry is a 2 hour 36 minute problem.The plot is good enough for a comic book movie, trying to stop a God (pardon me, a Celestial) from being born and thereby destroying the cool planet The Avengers have saved repeatedly.The nominal villains are monsters called Deviants that are about as threatening as any CG monsters. I thought they sucked. Any action flick is judged by its villains. These never threaten.So far every Marvel flick has had it's ""HELL YEAH!"" moment where the embattled heroes finally rise above their enemy. This one never even gets close to a moment like that,Zhao was the wrong choice for director. But the script was bad at times. Mostly this mess was Zhao's fault."
2281,10,"I don't understand all the hate This movie was action packed and had not amazing, but really nice visuals. It's not the best Marvel film, but it's in my top 10. People are saying it's too slow, but I like how it's a semi-slow burn. I get to know about the characters and see how close they are too each other, plus we get to see how human they really are. The ending was nice, and unexpected, especially the post-credit scenes. To me at least, a lot of people don't like this movie but I personally enjoyed it. Just give it a watch and give it a chance."
2282,3,Over bloated First time in years I wanted to walk out half way into a film out off boredom. The script was over bloated and the first half could have easily been reduced by 45mins to help pace the film better. Watchable but definitely the worst directed and written out off the Marvel universe. Hopefully the next instalment will improve.
2283,5,"Good movie Overall I liked the movie. The action scenes are good, Marvel level. The back and forth in past/present scenes got me confused once. The story is ok as well. I would've given it a 7 but the unnecessary love making scene makes it inappropriate to watch with my kids."
2284,10,"Eternals Innovative, and creative a welcome addition to the mcu. Character driven and expansive. The movie highlights the mcu has not run out of ideas and is still breaking the mold."
2285,10,Brilliant movie!!! Absolutely loved it! You've got to watch it! I love all Marvel movies and this one is just as good as the others. I won't give away spoilers but there are surprises!
2286,8,"A new type of Marvel film Eternals is a far different type of movie to any other Marvel movies. I see a lot of reviews and people complianing about the length and pace. It takes a slower pace and a long time to build up, but for those like me who prefer build-up to constant action, it's a great watch. Don't go in expecting to be constantly engaged in the action or flashy visuals, this isn't a light-hearted or ""fun"" movie in comparison to other Marvel films.It's not perfect, as there are some plot choices that I think could be done without, and the main couple stuggles to have a convincing chemistry, but overall the characters were fine. You will find yourself adoring the side characters much more than those who are the main focus, though! There's great representation and I found myself really loving the cast, even if it took a while for me to get a feel for them. I liked the plot and it did well at capturing the sort of cosmic terror the major threat in this film brought.The overall concept is interesting and the film is very visually appealing. It takes on a more alien or space-like vibe, with locations from ancient civilizations to modern day on earth as the backdrop. I loved the variety of locations, though if I had to nitpick, I really *really* dislike the ""superhero"" costumes. The thick material looks hard and clunky on the actors. Everything else was wonderful, though."
2287,6,"Good movie but not perfect It's definitely not as bad as people say. It's visually great and there were some memorable moments and some funny ones too. It was not like most of the MCU movies that make me stand in the edge of my seat to see what happens next, but it's a movie worth seeing with a climacting finale."
2288,10,"Ignore the critics It is definitely a different film and with a different vision in this type of film. It is a movie that intentionally wants to be slow and dense.Don't listen to the critics, it's a very good movie. They forget that it is a presentation film and that basically you have to develop 10 characters in 2 h 30 min and that is very difficult.My recommendation is that you give yourself to the film completely and do not look for errors, just enjoy it."
2289,7,"Enjoyed the movie, way long with unnecessary scenes This movie could have been brilliant but the move has 45-60mins of unnecessary useless scenes. How she doesn't get to direct anymore. I hope mcu stick to what they do best give us entertainment. Non of this silly love story cheese dance scene."
2290,7,"Not as bad - or as good - as they say At the time of writing this has 47% critics and 80% audience score on RT. The truth is it's somewhere inbetween.I'm not a fan of the more 'cosmic', out-there Marvel stories so I went into this with low expectations ... but was pleasantly surprised. I would echo some of the other comments I've see in that some of the diversity seems crow-barred in for the sake of it - I mean, if you're creating a super-hero then why make them only able to communicate thru sign language?? And why make one 14 forever!?? Doesn't make sense.It also seemed odd that they left a bloody great marbelised celestial in the middle of the planet, with bits poking out here and there ... how does that work!? Especially when Sersi made a point of saying that she could just turn stuff to air.They 'Irish' one was a bawbag as was Sprite. Both quite annoying.Not Marvels best but I was entertained. Hung around for the credits scenes and needn't have bothered. By this time you need to be a real comics nerd to get the references. Not like the good old days when they got you super-excited for the next movie. Thor's hammer...OMG!!"
2291,5,"Confusing So I would think the eternal would be more powerful than the Avengers. Powers were super unimpressive. Story seemed all over the place. The topic of sex, straight or not, felt forced upon the audience and unnecessary. Probably my least favorite Marvel flick."
2292,10,"The problem is... Critics are looking for a villain that is clear cut but the problem is, there are no CLEAR CUT VILLANS in this story coz the movie is actually a morality play - meaning what is the RIGHT THING TO DO versus WHAT MUST/SHOULD BE DONE? Does the end justify the means etc etc. And to the moviegoer who has followed all the MCU movies since Iron-Man 1 this movie is not that kind of fun GOTG kind of movie because this is the Mythology of the Marvel ""Comics"" Universe being established for the present day Cinematic Universe for which without it the origin stories of mutants/inhumans/fantastic four etc would be hard to bring to screen. That's why it's confusing to someone who never read the source material nor has been engrossed in the comics of Marvel before these movies have ever been made. The problem is it is a prerequisite IMO to read the comics to truly appreciate the movie made, ETERNALS in this case."
2293,10,"A Chloe Zhao Masterpiece The places (not green screen, real places!) and cinematography are truly a feast for the eyes. Well thought script, deep characters all around fantastic acting! This movie maybe not typical mcu movie but definitely a masterpiece. Kudos to Kevin Feige, choosing Chloe Zhao for directing."
2294,10,"From a loyal comic book reader from before the MCU, ""ETERNAL""-LY grateful for this Mythology brought to life in then movies! Quite understandable negative reviews and criticisms surrounding this movie from MCU fans and critics, yet for a comic book fan this movie has brought to life the Mythology of how the Marvel Universe was created and I love this for it! This is just laying down the foundations for which the House of Marvel will solidly stand once all the other Fox franchises that was acquired and whatever is left (Hulk/Spidey) returns and is fully realized in the MCU. This movie also is layered and nuanced enough that it actually might require one to both embrace the movie lore that was established since IronMan 1 up to present and the marvel comics mythology readings to truly enjoy this masterpiece. Otherwise without knowledge of the other this movie will truly make one scratch their head since both are required in order to appreciate what was created."
2295,10,"Loved It I loved watching the movie and wished that it would have last longer. I loved the characters and how divers they are, i hope to see them again soon ans get to know how the story goes on. I also loved the twists in the movie.I do not really understand all the negative comments, because the eternals thrilled me! I do really recommend it!"
2296,6,"6 I've decided to watch it not because I wanted just because my friend invited to go together. Well, it wasn't amazing, I wasn't surprised in any good way, it was just an average movie with some great but also some awful special effects. The main idea was really bad, plot was very messy and hard to fallow, even The legend of.... was better movie, this one was one of the worst Marvel's movie so far."
2297,7,"Not too good and not too worse!! Eternal is a low rated movie now but it needs a sequel because i'm very much excited about arishem and the eternal connection..arishem's voice😨😨😨..watched just now in theatres..i'll give 7/10 seeing their buildup story ,amazing graphics, but it was little bit boring and slow and i trust marvel could do justice to its sequel and would be much better than this.."
2298,3,"The first Marvel movie made by the team at DC Warner Brothers This thing was all over the place. There was so much exposition and it makes no sense why. I don't think Chloe Zhao directed Cloud Atlas but she may as well have. None of the deaths or relationships were earned or carried any weight. Icarus was wasted. Thena was wasted. The stupid kid was stupid. The mind control dude didn't do any mind control. They wasted this great actor in Barry Keoghan. You could tell he was ready to give a fantastic performance and they sidelined his character. It, just wow. Marvel knows how to take bad characters from the comics and make them interesting (see Shang Chi's Mandarin) but couldn't figure out how to do that with any of these characters."
2299,10,"I almost let reviews keep me from watching.... But...... I'm glad I didn't. I saw so many things about this movie being overly ""woke"" and trying to spread itself too thin with all of the characters. I can honestly say I did not go in with high hopes. I felt like those reviews and articles almost stopped me from watching a movie that I really did enjoy. I think the ""boundaries"" pushed were not shoved and ended being tastefully handled. I also didn't feel lost in the amount of characters. We actually went as a group of 12, very different, people, all of which really enjoyed it. I hope nothing stops a sequel from being made because I am very interested in seeing what happens next."
2300,10,"Only People with Higher IQ will love it. Just as the above line says ,you need to have understanding of so many things only then..Nuff said. They made a huge gate open now. You should definitely watch it atleast ones."
2301,8,"Different for the better This movie isn't your usual Marvel film, it's not the flying around blowing things up while making funny jokes movie you're used to from them, not that there's anything wrong with those. This is a nuanced more subdued from that focuses on the relationships of is characters and the fact this film spans thousands of years means there is a lot to go over yet I think it was handled very well with an atmosphere more similar to Dune than another Marvel movie."
2302,10,"Fresh and Groundbreaking The Eternals, directed by award-winning film-maker Chloé Zhao in her groundbreaking MCU debut, flawlessly showcases her unique genius and is as awe-inspiring and sensational as one might only expect of an epic tale of biblical proportions surrounding a legendary family of ethereal super-beings which spans millennia and breaksground in diversity and representation with its all-star cast. Along with outstanding cinematography, stunning special effects and block-buster action sequences, the film expertly explores the humanity of its heroes through themes of honesty, loyalty, betrayal and purpose."
2303,6,"Not even IMAX and moving seats save the day Nope. Uninspired and unimaginative story. What baffles me is the lack of sense of the plot when they could just have used the one from the comics to explain Eternals absence against Thanos. Still, the battle scenes are boring and feel like fillers. I'm sad due the amount of my money and my time wasted of my finite life."
2304,4,"WW84 was better ! I had seen several negative reviews before I watched this, but I still gave it a chance.Several people in my screening walked out part way through.The special effects and CGI were OK, but the story is mostly incoherent, with too many flashbacks and jumps forward in time.It doesn't really develop the characters, so you can't really care too much for most of them unlike The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy."
2305,9,"A visually stunning triumph that goes thematically deeper than any Marvel film thus far I have never been more disappointed leaving a movie than I was leaving ETERNALS. Not because of the movie -- in fact, it was because the movie was astonishingly great that I felt this way. I was disappointed because I have never seen such an instant and passionate hatred online for a movie, and for no concrete reason that I can discern. ETERNALS is perhaps the best MCU film since Avengers: Endgame, and is the most ambitious superhero film I can think of in the past few years. Every minute looks gorgeous and is a visual feast. Director Chloé Zhao dares to go thematically where no Marvel movie has gone before. This is a brave and different big-budget tentpole movie that finally gives fans the deeper experience that many have been craving from the MCU, so it's only natural that critics are tearing this movie to shreds for being ""boring"" and ""dry"" while praising Dune in the same breath.Eternals is, admittedly, a lesser known Marvel comic that only hardcore fans are likely to know in detail.. However, the plot is simple: the Eternals are immortal beings that have been residing on Earth for centuries and have seen it through each stage of human development. Their goal is to rid the Earth of Deviants: monsters who ravage planets and the life that resides on them. The film transitions between present-day and important events during the Eternals' history on Earth to effectively tell their story. In the present day, the Eternals begin to realize that the Deviants are returning for unknown reasons and planning something terrible for humanity. However, some truths that the Eternals have taken for granted are not what they seem, and the truth may reveal a more complicated reality that will unearth some uncomfortable revelations.From the very start, the look and feel of ETERNALS is different from any other superhero movie, and that is almost entirely attributable to Chloé Zhao, who directs this big-budget Marvel blockbuster like an indie film. Most directors, when they are sucked into the MCU, are forced to water down their artistic tendencies and cater to the formula that Disney has established for their superhero movies. While Zhao still includes many of the trademarks Marvel fans are used to seeing, the general approach is different and more ambitious than the traditional origin story. ETERNALS is an epic of gargantuan proportions that has to not only develop each character at a personal level, but has to relay the story of how the universe was created and why life exists. Zhao does all of this with an auteur's creativity and expertise, and always manages to connect every aspect of the story to the deep human emotions ingrained in the plot material. Along with this, it examines some of the most existential and essential human issues one can explore -- it shares many themes with Zhao's previous films but on a bigger scale.Zhao also adds her visual flair to ETERNALS, making this far and away the most visually impressive MCU film yet, which is saying quite a lot when Shang-Chi, Thor: Ragnarok and many others exist. Sure, the movie doesn't have as vibrant a color palette as, say, Ragnarok does, but, similar to Nomadland, Zhao constantly has an eye for the natural light and the beautiful Earthy background, which, in this case, adds to the sentimentality the Eternals have for the planet they've called home for thousands of years. The wide shots in this movie are gorgeous and shot in a way that no other director could, and that alone makes this film stand out from other superhero films. Some have pointed out the shotty CGI in one or two scenes, however I did not notice these while viewing but only when people complained about them on the Internet. Almost every scene in this movie has impressive visual effects, so one or two scenes where the effects are noticeable failed to take me out of the narrative.The narrative is constantly engaging and emotional, and develops more layers as it progresses. A common complaint I have seen circling around film conversations is that all of the characters are dry and boring, and that the movie drags on because nothing is interesting. Not only do I disagree wholeheartedly with these thoughts, but I think these are some of the most complex, human and yet larger-than-life characters the MCU has introduced in a solo movie. Much of the details regarding each character's arcs are somewhat spoilers and were not revealed in any promotional material for the film, so I won't go into too much more specifics here, but the ethical dilemma that the Eternals have to face regarding the fate of humanity is one that even I was struggling to decide upon.Sure, I understand ETERNALS is not going to be for everyone, but there is something about the reaction of this movie that seems off-putting to me. Not often do I see a movie regarded by all as being a complete failure before many have even seen it, especially when said movie is a fantastic and well-made film that stands out from the pack. The acting here is all top-notch, with not one weak link throughout (Richard Madden as Ikaris was perhaps my favorite, although there are many great performances), and there was never one scene that struck me as even getting anywhere near the definition of the word ""bad."" While this does not make the movie good on its own, I find it odd how Marvel fans have been clamoring for both a movie that breaks from the formula and a movie that showcases diversity, and when one that covers both comes handed to them on a silver platter, it becomes ""the worst rated MCU movie ever made."" All I know is that ETERNALS deserves far more attention than critics seem to be saying, and I genuinely believe that in years to come people will begin looking back at the initial reception of this film as being erroneous and misguided. The ideas it has are far more interesting and contemplative than the reviews seem to be saying, and the clear amount of effort and passion put into every shot tell a story of success and creativity.A."
2306,8,"Marvel took a risk, and I believe it's worth it It's true, it's not a typical MCU movie and, in my opinion, that's refreshing. Marvel took a risk with Eternals, tying to sophisticate the storyline and bring a never before seen representation in big blockbuster movies, and it works, in a way...The movie underperforms precisely because it tries to achieve to much in a limited amount of time with the biggest cast of leading characters I've ever seen, which left them, for the most part, underdeveloped (kinda like what happened in The Crimes of Grindewald), but it doesn't mean you can't appreciate how different and unique each of them are! Putting that aside and understanding the bigger scope of the story, it's really worth the watch. The Eternals focuses more on the characters moral conflict with the task they've been given then the typical evil vs good story we've all seen before. The ""we don't interfere"" plot line had me skeptical until I saw how, that even for the characters, it wasn't natural. It was also interesting to see the burden and the toll the ""don't interfere"" actions took on them and their relationships among themselves and the people. By the end the movie as paved the way to set itself free from the limitations it had in the first place, which is good and bad, since we're only see the true potential of the story in the next movies. Eternals also have to be praised in the amazing visual effects and directing by Chloé Zhao, it has some National Geographic levels of visuals.I do believe this movie and this story has potential and that we need to be more realistic and recognize the good and the bad, giving it a fair feedback. Because this way we, as fans, have a shot in putting constructive criticism out there and help pave the way to better content!"
2307,3,"Felt like a DC movie trying to be Marvel I love most Marvel films but this was dire. Instead of the slow burn building up characters loads are thrust down the throat from the off and they all seem one dimensional. There are sloppy mistakes dotted all over the place, the baddies are rubbish and it drags on and on. Very disappointing."
2308,8,"Finally! An MCU Film for Adults Finally, we get an MCU film for adults. The MCU has for far too long bored me with its child driven films up until the magnificent Infinity Wars. Feels good to forget about the spiders, wasps, men with shields and iron suits.Perfectly set storyline and great cinematography, this new Eternals phase seems to be really promising. Hopefully they will never cross this with the other childish characters."
2309,1,"Too Messy I had too much Expectations rot it But, It was too long, too messy, the lead (sersi) lacked charisma and emotion for me to care, it had the worse cgi character ever in the mid credit scene, and it felt totally unrelated to the mcu except for occasional name dropping and blip references.I whole heartedly wish for my 2:30h back."
2310,10,Amazing This is one of the best movies I have seen it looks pretty real some people have been talking bad about this movie without even seeing it the visuals are amazing and the diversity of the cast and the final scene is amazing.
2311,4,"Not so good script and directing So huge Mythology behind this movie, so little they gave to us.The movie didn't give us enough time to build and tie the story line for the Celestials to construct the Universe also their purpose and the necessary of Tiamut.At the end of the movie we felt an emptiness. You saw a lot of unnecessary side scenes but very few important ones.The dialogues were not so epic, and not so memorialized, only a few of them that I remember, unlike other mcu movies...Even so many flash backs didn't help to construct my interest about the feelings of the Eternals for the humans also their own character. Too many new characters to explore but we didn't have the time for all of them. We didn't fell their emotions so at the end some of their reaction was just unemotional and without reason.The Cgi for the deviants was bad, didn't like them at all, I think it was too rush and they didn't care to give much details."
2312,5,"Beautifully Shot but Forgettable With this cast and Chloe Zhao I expected amazing / fantastic instead I got okay. There were some amazing parts but they were too few and far between. The rest (okay most) was slow and at times plodding. I was not tempted to walk out of the movie but if something had come up I would not have been sorry to miss it. For me it was the script. They had the pieces of about 4 good movies here. If you are a Marvel fan it is not a total waste of time but is by no means a ""must see"".*SPOILERS AHEAD*I don't believe in making comments without suggestions to ""correct"" what I personally found wrong but those are just my opinions and we know what that is worth.I didn't really care about any of the Eternals. Too many of them and not enough time was spent getting to know them. Sersi was the main focus (if you chose one) but in a lot of ways we ended up knowing the least about her. Her relationships did not feel real to me. She is supposed to be torn between Ikaris and Dane but I never really got the feeling she cared that much about either. She was also supposed to be the one who loved humans the most but again I didn't feel that. Don't even get me started on the ""sex"" scene which served no purpose at all.Ikaris was also an enigma to me. The rest of the Eternals seemed to easily agree to go against their creators yet he was willing to kill his brothers and sisters for them. You never got a good explanation as to why.The rest of the cast had interesting mentions but nothing was explored enough. Though personally I think they should have revealed more of them knew the real purpose of their mission than just two.My Stupid Solution: A Disney+ series should have been done to lead into the movie with single or multiple episodes to explain the characters. They could have focused on what they did individually after they split. Since so little was covered in the movie you could have done so without any spoilers.Villains: The Deviants served no purpose in this movie. The super deviant was never explained and was ended almost as if they were filming and someone decided they needed to at the last minute.My Stupid Solution: It could have been revealed that deviants actually have genetic memory. The reason they started killing people on their planets is that they remembered what was going to happen and were doing what they could to delay it (basically using Thanos' logic). You could also make ""Mad Weary"" not a actual medical condition but instead the deviants trying to communicate with the Eternals and tell them what is actually going on by showing them their past.Dane Whitman: Unclear why he was even in this movie at all. You could have just mentioned him and gotten the same effect.My Stupid Solution: Dane should have stayed with Sersi the whole time. Then during the final battle he should have gotten between Sersi and Ikaris summoning the Ebony Blade to protect her. His willingness to accept the consequences of the curse in order to protect her would have at least given their relationship some of the depth it was missing.There is more of course... why did Gilgamesh stay with Thena, how did Sersi change the one deviant, why did Makkari chose to live in the ship, why would a being who can create entire universes resort to making a robot army instead of a living one, etc..."
2313,10,"A nice change of pace Marvel make some great films but they're all quite similar, this one stands out as something a bit different, it's less about the giant boss battles and much more about character development. (There are still a load of great fight scenes though)The representation of POC, disability and LGBT characters is massively refreshing and helps make marvel far more reflective of the actual world e.g. Not everyone society is white, straight and without disability and seeing the representation after 11 years of MCU is lovely.The CGI was perfect with one exception of a single character at the end."
2314,8,"I don't know what the critics saw. This movie was great imo. I have been a mcu fan as long as I can remember and most times, when a mcu movie comes out, you hear critics go like "" this is the most unique marvel movie ever made"". And I always see that as some bs cos most mcu films look alike. Then I saw Eternals and i truly saw how different the film is from not just mcu films but any other COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER MADE.Visually, it was gorgeous, they put in the work for the visuals and costume. There are some shots you will wish to reverse and see it again cos it looked beautiful.Not all character gets a fledged out story and that's fine cos it is a 2 1/2 hour film and can't have all the characters developed but i thought every character in likeable even the ones you will gradually hate.I suggest you go see the film yourself and give your own ratings."
2315,8,"IMDb is getting toxic I don't understand why people like to review bomb new/different movies. There's literally people on this program that will watch EVERY SINGLE Marvel movie and hate on them all. If you hate them all so bad why are you watching it?Another thing. Stop comparing other movies to this movie. Eternals isn't a sequel or continuation, it is its own movie. It was an amazingly cinematic movie. The scale was huge, the scenes were great, the twists were surprising and the ending was suspenseful. I don't know why people except an Oscar Award Winning movie every time they watch a marvel movie."
2316,8,Eternally grateful The movie really does have it all! Something fresh and new from marvel and yet it still feels like they kept their roots. Amazing story and cinematography. There are so many amazing scenes and backdrops because of the different eras it shows. Action scenes were great! I really don't have any complaints about this movie. It really is a great story about differences coming together. Richard madden stole the show. Good comedic timing in the movie as well. Classic marvel. This was an amazing experience. Excited for more like this.
2317,10,Not as bad as people are making it out to be Yes the story and some of the acting could of had some work done but overall a very visually rich and story rich movie with a plot that kept me invested for at least 80 percent of the movie and for me that's good enough.
2318,3,Too many topics and still dull This movie was trying to be deep but it was just too much. Too many topics and none of them fully explained or resolved.There's just too much going on from one scene to the next.I ended up just not caring for any of the characters.
2319,6,Good writing story...... Story of the movie I think good . I saw so many superheroes with lots of power . Director missed so many fighting sequence which I did not feel I was watching Marvel movie . I don't feel they have much power then Avengers . Ok last ending I am disappointed with fighting sequence . Kit's character is still making me suspense . In film I little bit boarded .
2320,6,"50%, 30% rather good, 20% building up future movies. First half was just boring stuff, then a nice twist with a good showdown, then the rest of the movie back to boring and predictable build up the next movies.Visually a very good one from Marvel. Some nicely different powers from the Eternals, exept Ikarus. Laser eyes, really? How original. LOL.Acting wise, marvel managed it again to get accomplished actors playing like being absent. Richard Madden stood out, best performance, most others were just bland. Compere Selma Hayek with ""Killer's bodyguard"" in terms of not the characters but expression, intensity, etc.Overall, much better than black widow, but below Shang Li. Too many characters that leaves you indifferent. One can, but not must see movie. I recommend home cinema with a couple of cocktails or beers ;-)"
2321,10,"Beautiful-I loved it! I really enjoyed this movie and it exceeded my expectations. Eternals had a lot of storytelling to pack into one movie, and I thought it was achieved pretty well through the jumping between past and present, which felt seamless.I really appreciated the diverse casting, and I especially loved the relationship dynamics between the individual Eternals, and the exploration into the different friendly, familial, and romantic ones. It made me feel that more attached to each of their story arcs, especially during the climax of the movie. I think you'll really enjoy this movie if you enjoy character storytelling in your movies.There were definitely a few moments that had me jumping in my seat, and there were many moments where I was on the edge, filled with anxiety for the outcome of the battles (as always).Overall, I can't stop thinking about this movie and the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have a feeling I'll go see it again in theaters ASAP."
2322,3,"Dark world isn't the worst marvel's movie, not anymore. Bad, Terrible, Awful, Horrible, Boring, Shot, dire, horrific ,dreadful ,gruesome, fierce ,monstrous, bloodcurdling, lurid, wretched.I don't think there's any other words to describe it, The story is from 1700 years ago, and it takes 2000 years to finish it in the movie, Bad pacing, boring story, too long for nothing good, And of course has no identity. Marvel should've stopped after ENDGAME at their peak, after that everything is bad and not worth the time, Spider-Man, Black Widow, wanda and Loki, they were ok like 6 of 10, but this, i want my money back."
2323,8,GOOD Different from other marvel movies.but a good movie sets the path for another phase. I liked it. Whatever other people say but it is a good movie.not perfect still have much to say.
2324,8,"""THE ETERNALS"" REVIEW ""THE ETERNALS"" REVIEWDirected by Chloe Zhao. Starring a Multitude of high profile actors like Salma Hayek who plays ""Ajak"" the commander/leader of the Eternals who has the power to heal. Gemma Chan who you might know from ""My Crazy Rich Asians"" plays ""Sersi"" a compassionate being with the power to turn anything into other elements like fire, flowers, and water.The Superman template like character but of course obviously better at least that's how they feel in the film. They were some definite DC jabs thrown by Marvel through ""Ikaris"" played by Richard Madden. Who was also ""Sersi"" first life partner. Which connects to the next character ""Dane Whitman"" played by Kit Harington. Which we all know as ""Jon Snow"" from ""Game of Thrones"". I completely forgot and it didn't connect until I saw a press conference. Richard Madden who plays ""Ikaris"" played ""Jon Snow's"" brother in ""Game of Thrones"". So they have a great standing relationship. In this case ""Dane"" is ""Sersi"" human boyfriend. But just because he's human doesn't mean there isn't more that meets the eye with him and his story line.Angelina Jolie plays the famed ""Thena"" with the power to Conjure sword like weapons. She has a slight twist because even though she's a ultimate warrior, she also has a form of Alzheimer's you could say. Her handler and fellow Eternal ""Gilgamesh"" played by Ma Dong-seok. Who has the power of strength enhancements. Lauren Ridloff who plays ""Makkari"" a mute Eternal that has flash like speed. ""Phastos"" played by Brian Tyree Henry aka ""Paper Boy"". All my ""Atlanta"" fans know about him and are extremely happy to see him blossom to this level of stardom ""Phastos"" is super smart and is a ultimate inventory.""Druig"" played by Barry Keoghan with the power to control minds. Kumail Nanjiani who plays ""Kingo"" who can make his fingers turn into a sort of plasma energy gun. His comic relief was spot on especially with the type of heaviness that surrounded them. Lia McHugh who plays ""Sprite"" a Illusionist. She looks like a little girl but is ancient. ""Sprite"" has the burden of being an adult but not being able to live an adult life.Eternals is the beginning of a new saga. This a something brand new being injected into the MCU. You follow this vast cast as it shows how they played a pivotal part in the Earths evolution. You find out who they work for and their true purpose. You follow them as they battle these monsters called ""Deviants"" which are there mortal enemy but fine out it's more Nuance then what you may think. The Eternals are faced with a Dilemma and you see how they work through it all, while fighting an ever evolving ""Deviant"".Their are so many characters and it's so new. But I throughly enjoyed it. The director Chloe Zhao said she called ""Dune's"" Director to get some pointers. Hers is visually stunning like ""Dune"" but way better. Visually and just as a Movie. I've been saying, I'm seeing a lot of visually pleasing movies but the actual movie is lacking in everything else. This was a full round movie. It had to accomplish a lot being a brand new story while giving a good script and action. It showed and told a great story. It was visually beautiful, the cinematography was amazing.With a diverse cast, done on purpose because it embodied the world. With many different Ethnicities being portrayed to ""Phastos"" being gay, having a husband and child. To ""Makkari"" being a mute. It did come off very Justice League ish. But I would say deeper. It didn't help that they mentioned members of the justice league when they took not so subtle jabs at DC. It also gave us a love scene. Which we've never seen done like that before. I could say this was a really good drama movie they just happen to have powers. Curious to see what the future holds and how it ties in to other things. But this felt very different from everything else we've seen before in the MCU. It's definitely in its own lane. It has two post credit scenes. I give it four more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥 #CosmoandtheMovieWithin #CosmoMovieBlog #CosmoLanier #TheEternals."
2325,8,"I don't care about the critics, I loved it Yes, it probably has some cinematic flaws that will bug me when I rewatch it, but for a first viewing experience I thought it was great. There were at least one major twist that I was not expecting, and a couple smaller twists that really got me emotionally (but I'm a sucker for the feels, so...) In all, this movie really got me excited to see where they are going with the next MCU phase, more so that Black Widow or Shang-Chi, although they were good too."
2326,3,"A film with potential, but is ultimately too ambitious and falls short. 'Eternals' is a visually appealing piece, however lacks all the other fundamentals of a good film. The storyline was at (many) times all over the place, and I was left confused at many points in the film as well as feeling little sense of any solid direction. The characters, played by a notably A-list and diverse cast, were for the most part underdeveloped which let down the actors, and the characters failed to provide any substantial depth or arc to this film (however I felt most captivated by Nanjiani's character). Additionally, the film drags on far longer than it needed to due to the poor pacing of the story, and ultimately finishes on an underwhelming and somewhat messy note. The fighting scenes, and in particular the final battle sequence, rely heavily on stunning but over-the-top visual effects to keep the audience engaged. In contrast, the acting and soundtrack stood alongside the visual effects in adding to the films pluses, but the cons do far outweigh the pros on this one.Worth the watch? Give it a miss."
2327,2,What were they thinking!? I'm a regular moviegoer (weekly) and this is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. The way this film is presented is not to be taken serious. The script is a dull mess and the majority of actors were a miscast. It was hard to sit this one out. Really bad. Esoteric nonsense. Silver lining ... I liked the music.
2328,2,"Boring Non-Interesting Characters Boring story and characters. Marvel is done. They would be better off going back to the past with main Avengers characters. First, second and third act were not entertaining at all. I'm not just upset about purchasing 9 tickets at Cinemark in Orlando, but the fact that lost about 2.5 hours of my life for this piece of garbage. I can re-gain my money, but I would never get that time back. I owe my family an apology."
2329,9,"Well made film It truly lives upto an action packed Sci-fi Marvel Universe movie leaf by mega Stars. Angelina Jolie, and Salma Hayek can still awe the audiences with their action sequences.Kumail Nanjani does an excellent job in keeping audiences enthralled and his light comedy keeps things super funny.The story at times seems to struggle at times. As if the story had to comply toaction sequences rather than the other way around."
2330,7,Different. Interesting. Long! It was a very good film. Clearly the MCU is going intergalactic and setting up Phase 4 is going to be hard given the fact we've been spoilt over the last 10 years. Loses its way a bit but a very enjoyable ride and is setting up yet another large chapter in Marvel movies.
2331,4,"Lifeless corporate product with perhaps some good intentions While one must appreciate some progress in inclusiveness in the Hollywood entertainment - though long overdue and too lukewarm in the context of the West, rejected with the ridiculous stubbornness in the (Middle and Far) East - putting a representative of multitude of imaginable ethnicities, sexualities and differently-abled in the movie and let them do a bit of punching ... does not suffice.From a large part this felt like a pre-calculated corporate concoction made according to ""good old recipe"" proven to generate some cash: a bit of distorted history, a bit of adjusted mythology, a bit of ""cool"" swords and sandals, some spaceships, some dragon/wolf-like monsters with lot of eyes and teeth (jeez, some imagination please!), some family values, some internal fighting, some hero traumas ... and stir occasionally, bake until golden.I am sick and tired of all these fights and battles inserted tactically just because ""it is cool"" and ""that's what people come to see"". Just make someone fight for something. Really, it is boring and left me so oblivious, that I will not even ponder if the blockbusters degenerated into this sterile hodge-podge because that was what the average audience wanted, or the customer taste was over time ""cultivated"" to be satisfied with this ""a bit of fight a bit of love"" template non-sense. Even the 1990s catastrophic epics look like a ""high art"" compared to this ""fast film"" hamburgeriade.Idiotic costumes and kitschy designs - even for a comic adaptation. Some fighting with absurd weapons and abilities that in its entirety would be too much even for a parody. Concocted storyline. Horribly painful replicas, debilitating dialogues, whimsical motivation. Are the studio managers so stupid or so anxious in relying on the elementary-school few-word sentences that actually just comment on what is happening on the screen? Is drawing a real story, real characters with real problems and real conversations (even at the median intelligence level) such a market risk for the product? Please let the writers write and the directors to direct!"
2332,9,"Subtlety, Nuance, Emotion Marvel, and comics in general, have been considered modern day mythology for years. These grandiose epics of a pantheon of heroes doing the impossible. Eternals fits that concept perfectly. This doesn't feel like a comic book movie. It feels like a period piece, with characters so distinctly separate from humans that the amount of humanity they showed shocked me. Aside from the spectacular visuals and solid acting, The Eternals does an amazing job of making - for lack of a better term, ""gods"" - the most human heroes we've had in awhile."
2333,7,"Not perfect but there's a lot to love The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a triumph, whether the superhero action blockbusters are to your taste or not, their creations have shaped the cinematic landscape for over a decade and continues to leave fans more eager for expansion than ever. Eternals is the latest entry in Marvel's phase four rollout and the 26th film in the franchise overall, that's not even including the juggernaut's expansion into television.Marvel is obviously popular, but not beyond criticism, and has often been accused (among other things) of being too conservative, and recycling their formula, creating safe and soulless films.Eternals tries something a little different, an epic superhero saga spanning thousands of years, featuring a cast of superpowered ancient beings that are about as relatable as Howard the Duck. It's also one of the longest movies in the franchise to date, stretching over two and a half hours, and featuring ten never before seen characters, which all must be developed and fully fleshed out. At the time of writing this review, the film has garnered mixed reviews, and it's clear that the film isn't for everyone. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Eternals, and despite some legitimate problems spattered throughout its considerable run time, the more time passes the more respect I have for the film and the bold and often brilliant choices it makes.Despite the high concept nature of the film, the plot itself is fairly straightforward. The Eternals have been sent to earth and are instructed to only interfere unless Deviants are involved. The Deviants in question are hulking grey wibbly-wobbly aliens that cause carnage and generally wreak havoc. After thousands of years of fighting these nasty boys, their task is seemingly complete, and the team goes their separate ways. However, flash forward to the present day and the unexpected and unexplained re-emergence of The Deviants causes the team to reform and uncover a mystery bigger than any of them could have ever imagined.Despite the large cast of characters, it's clear that Sersi, played by Gemma Chang is the protagonist of the story. She's the character with the most screen-time and is given the most to do. She has the power of matter transmutation and can turn something into something else. I was surprised by the application of her gift, and it presents some genuinely great moments and proved to be far more useful in a combat situation than I expected. In a world of smashy-crashy-punchy people, these are the kind of weird abilities more characters need. The film largely succeeds in balancing screen-time between the rest of The Eternals, with everyone getting something to do, and motivations that make sense. The first Avengers movie notoriously gave Hawkeye the short end of the straw, rest assured that this does not happen in Eternals.My favourite characters outside of Sersi, were Kingo, Druig, and Gilgamesh. Kingo provides plenty of laughs throughout the film and out of all the Eternals had the strongest connection to the people of Earth. Druig proved to be one of the more emotionally complex characters that I thought initially I would hate, but his motivations were ultimately relatable, and I found myself siding with him above all others. Finally, Gilgamesh used his limited screen-time to leave a big impression, adding laughs and heart to an otherwise epic film.Marvel's track record with villains is very hit and miss, Eternal's baddies The Deviants, are given some complexity and motivation, but ultimately it amounts to very little. This is my biggest gripe with the film, and I found them to be very underwhelming. First of all, I don't really care for the design of these space monsters, they don't look fun they look boring, and not for a moment did I believe they could actually exist. Where Thanos or the Skulls look like they could exist in the real world these grey blobs simply could not. Their leader or head honcho is a Deviant named Kro, and he is potentially the ugliest alien in recent memory. The film attempts to make him more than a hulking monster but come the finale it doesn't come together in a satisfying way, and he ends up being very forgettable.To be honest, The Deviants are my only real big criticism, and I found that the majority of the film worked for me. This truly is one of the most epic films Marvel has produced to date and I liked that about it. It was bold and beautiful. Sure, there are expositions dumps here and there and I really hope we don't start every film with a scrolling wall of text from here on in. There's a lot of mythology to unpack here, we are after all talking about the start of the Marvel Universe here.Directed by Chloe Zhao, she brings a different feel to Eternals from other entries in the franchise, with epic sweeping visas and a more serious tone. That doesn't mean it's for everyone, and mainstream audiences may reject its sense of grandeur and sci-fi craziness. For me at least Eternals was a pleasant surprise, and going in I tempered my expectations given the mixed reviews, but ultimately enjoyed the experience for the most part. Eternals succeeds mostly in exploring a new corner of the marvel universe, providing an epic tale that is truly unlike anything the franchise has done before. Featuring many complex and enjoyable characters, the film however fails to reach the peak of the genre due to its weak and muddled villains."
2334,3,"The WORST Marvel movie ever made. It's true, it's worse than The Green Lantern. Terrible script, forced characters that don't feel natural, a story that you just done care about and forced political correctness gone mad makes this a mcu movie that you should save your cinema ticket money, wait for it to come out on DVD and not buy it. A villain that laughably the heroes all struggle to dispatch the entire movie only to have him ended in a blink of an eye, and a who dunnit moment that you can see from the start of the movie- Its disappointing sadly. Just goes to show even Marvel Studios can release a real lemon of a movie.Save your money and AVOID!"
2335,7,Not too good not too bad Actions was good. But lack of story little bit as the director said inspired by Zack work thats true like they fight with ikhris was great love seeing it and mercury fight ikhris was great & mind-blowing.Sold 7 from my side.
2336,5,"Couldn't care enough My favorite character was the valet, I think that says it all...while I understand the difficulty behind introducing about eight different characters and making us care for every single one of them, at least one would've suffice.They spend so much time trying to explain what they are or what's going on that they forget to develop the characters that should be driving this story forward.Additionally, the pacing is all wrong. It seems rushed at the beginning and way too slow in the middle, only picking some speed near the end.At moments, I had an issue with the lines delivery - felt either too rushed or too slow, never quite where it was supposed to be. And some lines were questionable at best.Overall, I give it a 5/10 because the acting was decent and I was entertained at the end. However, I think I like it more for the potential it presents for the MCU rather than for what it is."
2337,5,"With 157 Mins, Marvel's Eternals Feels a Bit like an Eternity No offense, Phase 4 of the MCU films has been nothing but a streak of okay-ish films for me. It seems that the bar has been set low compared to previous phases which did live up to audience's expectations.Marvel's Eternals is the first MCU film to ever receive a rotten score and it is also the lowest rated MCU film to date in Rotten Tomatoes. But how? After all these years they have produced such quality superhero films, how can Eternals be worse than Thor: The Dark World?Throwing the linear mode out of the window, Eternals jumbles back and forth manifesting a sequence of incoherent narrative that feels misplaced and sudden, skipping centuries of backstory that ultimately impacts the emotional weight the whole movie should carry.With a tangled narrative of character developments, one cannot feel emotionally invested, barely touching the base of humane values, wasting an expedition that solely relies on the A and B-list casts. Some downfalls & deaths feel apathetic leading Eternals to one of the more forgettable MCU films.The core issue this movie has is its problems of sourcing its screen time for the characters justly and equally. Half of the characters, though some undeserved, get way more spotlight than some others.But unlike most MCU films, Eternals provides real stakes to them as we get to see some survive and some don't. However, because the backstory is largely impotent, characters who don't make it feel that their sacrifices are made meaningless and insignificant, a major turn-off for Marvel fans.Eternals also attempts to create a masterfully beautiful piece of rich storytelling, only to fall flat with its formulaic plot, by trekking and grouping the Eternals one by one without any real tension or heavy conflicts.Don't get me started on the costumes. What the Eternals wear feel plain and cheap, resulting in an unimmersive experience as it projects this parody-like vibe that fails to provide authenticity and aesthetic values.For an assemble team film, Eternals could have gone way better in almost every aspect. Indeed, the entertainment value seeps its way occasionally but it idles through its running time in a slow-fashioned indie style that the excitement never actually meets its peak.Albeit the lack of screentime, Makkari is definitely my top-tier character out of the 10, followed by Sersi and Thena taking the top 3 spots. All of them have the charisma and charm that other characters are lacking of.Yes, there are plenty of action scenes here and a lot of them are choreographed well but they offer nothing new except wjen Makkari steps in.Angelina Jolie is the queen! She is so presentable, even when her character is flawed, she makes Thena seems so golden and likeable.After Shang Chi's mystical creatures made a bizarre appearance, Eternals also sets itself up with a disappointing finale that looks like a combination of Dragonball & Power Rangers. The final climax seems off and rushed, it is as if Chloe doesn't really understand the MCU assignment.Adding to that, the whole finale isn't set as a fight important enough for the presence of every Eternals and aside from Makkari & Thena, it lacks the commitment of displaying their true potential power and only shows a sneak peek of what they can do.The most powerful asset the MCU has to offer ths time is its pair of end-credits scenes, one being the already-leaked cameo and the other features a voice & weapon belonging to an anticipated character.Injecting both blockbuster & indie DNAs into one, Marvel's Eternals aims for a MARVELous oeuvre but as the idea of new directions approached, it stumbles upon what feels like an eternity, resulting in a mediocre made assembled film."
2338,6,It's a good movie It has some great scenes and a decent plot but by no means it's in the top MCU movies. At some points the pacing can be a little slow but the movie as a whole has some good emotional scenes and some genuine good jokes. The acting is on point and it's definately a movie that I could watch again in the future. The reason why I don't rate it higher is cause the movie didn't have me in the edge of my seat to see how it will conlcude unlike some other MCU movies where I'm invested 100%. Tho as a whole it's a watchable movie.
2339,5,"A Beautiful meh movie. Yes, it is beautiful. But the good things end there. The rest are not bad just meh. Not really interesting. Some characters are interesting like Indian Guy and Thena. Others are boring like Circe and Ikarus.I have one problem with this movie. While the Eternals being for all races makes sense, Speedy Girl being Mute and Phastos being fat does not. Its not like they are human. They were literally created for fighting the Deviants. So this movie cares more about diversity than being a good movie. And when diversity is illogical it leaves a bad taste.The one cool thing the movie had was the Deviant that was stealing the powers. But the movie instead of using it, ut just didnt."
2340,10,"amazing , a very good source film It is not the best Marvel movie . But because it is a film of origin , with no one knowing much about the characters , it becomes a very good movie , it has a Marvel comedy , an action , with time I make it grow very beloved characters over time There are moments, it gets a little confusing, but it's a fun movie, the hours go by quickly."
2341,10,This is a great movie Seriously this movie is top tier marvel. It was long but I never lost interest this whole movie really had me.And I'm so excited to see where this goes.
2342,10,"Poor Screenwriting A very loose character perspective , could have done more background story telling. Eternal by their name not given a justice , hope marvel fix all the loose ends and explain celestial true meaning..."
2343,10,Marvel as taken big turn in there moives Best i moive i have seen in. Recent year Marvel cinematic journey is going to be big by this moive i just loved it. The characther are unqie in the moive ecpecting more surpised from marvel.
2344,9,I don't get all the negative reviews I went into this movie thinking it was going to be boring/bad because of all the negative reviews. I'm not sure where all those bad reviews are coming from but I thought this was a great movie.It's not a copy and past of the generic super hero movies (which is a good thing) and is still really entertaining.The only thing I can think of is that this movie has a tone a bit more serious than some of the others marvel movies. So I can understand how a 12 yo expecting a generic marvel movie might not be as entertained.
2345,9,"Marvel's most sophisticated film to date..... Eternals is the most sophisticated marvel's film so far.Beautiful Cinematography, beautiful locations, amazing visual effects, great set decoration and production desing, the fanciest costume desing, a beautiful and epic music piece and on top of that one of the most talented A list hollywood cast and director Chloé Zhao.This film did not disappoint, it may have some problems, like any other marvel film but not as auwful as critics say. We get to meet all of the eternals and see who they are, what they been trough and what they are fighting for. Troughout the film we experienced a beautiful and great time travel to the most important human history and ancient cultures where eternals have always been present. We also witness human mistakes and progress trough the eyes of the eternals.This film has everything from an interesting drama plot to stunnig action scenes with mindblowing visual effects from the celestials and deviants. The film do not deserve all the hate is receiving, it seems more that this hate it's againts a woman directing it, lgbt inclusion, diversity and originality from all the previous films.Just to be clear this film is not rotten at all, actually it is and should be one of the greatest marvel films to date."
2346,10,"A Solid Marvel Movie I know that there are quite a few people who don't like Eternals and I can understand why. It's not as action packed as The Avengers and Iron Man but it is still a good entry into the Marvel Universe movies. The visuals are absolutely stunning and like all Marvel and DC films, the music was spot on. The main characters were well established and the actors were well cast. The storyline is very Marvel formula which I think is going to eventually become a problem as people will become so used to it that they will become bored. But that was not the case here. The story was interesting enough to keep me watching and the dynamic between the different characters kept me engaged. I found myself liking these characters and wanting to follow their stories.The special effects were great, but with both Marvel and DC, I would expect nothing less. There were a couple of small twists but nothing really huge and there were a few side characters that were really likable and engaging. I won't go right into the plot as there are so may reviews, but if you like an action movie with real heart, this is for you."
2347,8,Another great movie to continue phase 4! I know this movie is getting very mixed reviews right now but I went into this movie with very low expectations and was honestly surprised of how happy I was while leaving the theater. The visuals and CGI were spotless and the acting was great. This was a story movie and the action was underwhelming at some parts but I never found myself bored throughout its 2hr 40min runtime. I recommend you watch and don't base your opinion on what critics say. A solid 8.5 for sure! Hope there's a second movie.
2348,3,"I wanted to like this film but... Playing on ancient aliens type themes, the film tries too much and basically attributes all human ingenuity and progress to these Eternals. There are simply too many threads going on in this film to have any satisfying pay-off. Its visuals are generally pretty good-but nothing we haven't seen before. Frankly, I feel like they did a bit too much. Some of the characters are fun, but frankly, there are too many to keep track of for a comic film where every character is new to us and the MCU (and I'm fairly familiar with Marvel comics). Furthermore, it feels like there were overt attempts to appeal to the Woke mob (as Marvel seems wont to do these days). It's fine to have an ethnically diverse cast-and of course we have our LGBTQ representation that seems like a requirement these days (though still easily cut for Chinese distribution because they're not going to alienate the PRC of course). But the only white male in the primary cast who seems to have the most power is our surprise villain. It's rather heavy-handed allegorically if you're sensitive to it. But all that aside, the film has too much going on to be as cohesive of a story as it should be. It's not boring though, so I can give it that."
2349,10,Love the new way of direction The movie is bit different than usual Marvel movies. But the storyline was evolving in interesting manner. All the actors did better performance. I wish Angelica Jolie should have more screen time.
2350,10,"Amazing new formula This a very different movie, jokes feel natural, good photography, good soundtrack, and a good story, enough time to tell what happened with the Eternals all this time, people who hate this movie it's because they just want the same old and boring formula with a simple story, lot of stupid jokes. It's much better than some of the other Marvel movies. Ikaris feel like Henry Cavil Superman and after Director confirmation I'm happy with that."
2351,10,"Don't listen to the review bombers This movie is not a 10/10, so why did I give it that?At the time that I am writing this, there have been people who are review bombing this movie because of its representation and diversity which is absolutely disgusting.This is a great superhero movie which is introducing so much to the MCU and does it very well. Right now it is the lowest rated MCU movie on Rotten Tomatoes and is under a 7 on IMDb. It should be at least a 7 and is bu FAR not the worst MCU movie, probably around top 8-12 for me.Watch this and make your own opinions but please rate it higher than you think to balance out the people hating it for the wrong reasons."
2352,4,"Yes I rated it a 4... ...because it was nice to see re-emergence of Angelina Jolie, but that was my only hope for this film! I had hoped earlier when Thanos had his day that we not have to suffer through monumental versions & re-version of the MCU. A move that sold millions of comics by re-writing all the rules with the mere creation of yet another universe... wanna make an evil guy with spider skill easy new universe, want bring in ancient gods and mega-humans with mythologic back stories and powers just whip up another universe. I lost interest when they pulled the trick with comics and I find it even more frustrating that they are taking the movies down the some rabbit hole. Sorry to say this movie maybe only the beginning... good luck following the story (s) as they make it through the merengue of MCUs. As far me, well I can re-watch the originals."
2353,8,Everyone is just being annoying It's not an avengers movies. It was never suppose to be an avengers movie. That's why people are disappointed. This movie is absolutely beautiful. They were able to fully develop each eternal and shows each of their relationships with the others. This movie is about love and family and it's beautiful.
2354,9,"What a terrible time to be alive if you're prone to overthinking Super Fan Boys and Girls are not as kind to ""Eternals"" as I'm going to be.Personally I think Marvel is returning to their Golden days with new films like ""Ten Rings"" and this one.After ""End Game"" Marvel needed to up its own game to try and keep up after setting the bar so damn high.They achieved this by introducing us to some never seen on the big screen before Comic Book Characters whose Universe is affected by other happenings in Marvel Cinematic Universe.The only thing is these Celestial Superheroes (using derivations of Greek Mythological Gods names) are only allowed to observe and not interfere with human wars (including Thanos).The saga of the ""Eternals"" is truly Epic and opens thousands of years ago in Earths history, then keeps bouncing back and forth in time with subtitles for era and location thank goodness.This flick focuses on a race of immortal beings who lived on Earth in the shadows, shaping its history and civilizations with the invention of the Wheel, the Plough and awkwardly the Nuclear Bomb amongst other things.""Eternals"" is being applauded for the MCU's first ever Gay Superhero...an African/American male in a same sex relationship, who's adopted a son.It's all a sign of the shifting sands of times for this conglomerate...the Adult Males also share an on screen kiss.Some saying better late than never.Another first is finally a Deaf Superhero, ""Makkari"" portrayed by real life deaf actress Lauren Ridloff.Every Superhero movie needs comic relief and Kumail Najuani as ""Kingo"" provided plenty of laughs.Watch out for his dance scene.He's looking fit for a comic actor after going on a strict low carb diet and working out religiously for months.Harish Patel as ""Karun"" adds to the fun as ""Kingo's"" assistant with shades of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", ""Kumar"".There is good news for Game of Thrones fans because two of the stars from that series, Richard Madden and Kit Harrington, have leading roles in ""Eternals"".The antagonists in this Action, Adventure, Drama are called Deviants and the fight scenes with these CGI creatures are brutal.There are also hints of ""Lost Boys"" and ""Peter Pan"" in the script with Lia McHugh as ""Sprite"" playing an elfish ""Tinkerbell"" type role to Maddens' ""Peter"".The movie has a very worldly feel because of the various shooting destinations including Canary Islands, London & Los Angeles.Sure there's a lot of explaining to do for those who believe there are enough creation myths in MCU already.But let's not get bogged down in goofs and detail, because in the words of singer/songwriter George Ezra, ""why, why what a terrible time to be alive if you're prone to overthinking it, why, why what a terrible time to be alive if you're prone to second guessing it."" However Pretty Shiny People I do have three of my own issues with this production.Firstly, how similar are the powers of ""Ikaris"" to Superman...only thing missing is a cape.Which even gets referenced by a child in one scene.The second is how all the actors playing these mythical Gods use their own native accents from Scottish to Irish, English to American etc and its never accounted for.And finally the giant Elephant in the Room is their interstellar space craft thats shaped like a giant Tablet for reading Audiobooks on.Look I'm no NASA Space Engineer, but I do know a bit about aerodynamics and this huge rectangle has none.Ignore the critics who say it needs to be serialised for Disney Plus and given more room to breathe.Make up your own mind about this 2 hour 37 minute marathon event at your local Cinema.Whatever you do, don't leave before the house lights come on because there's a couple of Easter Eggs you won't want to miss.Here's hoping any possible sequel will answer all our questions and iron out some of the quirks and maybe give us spin off story lines with even more Superheroes and Villains.""Eternals"" has plenty of twists and turns and you won't know which side to root for at times.Music fans listen out for a wonderful soundtrack which includes: Pink Floyd & Foreigner plus a score from Raman Djawadi...only his second time in MCU after starting with their first film, ""Iron Man"".All of this amazing movie is crafted by Oscar winning Director Chloe Zhao."
2355,8,"Ignore the trolls! There's a lot to like in this new MCU film. With the exception of just two or three little lines of dialog that reference previous movies, Eternals is the closest thing to a new, truly stand-alone story that Marvel has done since Iron Man in 2008 -- a whole new cast of characters we haven't seen before, anywhere. That alone is refreshing! I see that director Chloe Zhao (Nomadland, The Rider) is getting slammed by numerous critics for (a) being too much of an auteur director to do superhero films, or (b) abandoning her auteur status to do superhero films, or worst of all (c) daring to introduce (shock! Horror!) a *gay relationship*, right there on screen! The trolls who are piling on with ridiculous 1/10 ratings are I suppose reacting to that third item most of all. She can't win. Just ignore all of this and go enjoy the actual movie. And there's a lot to enjoy. There are loads of action scenes, new characters to get acquainted with, some decent character development, and an expansion of the MCU universe in a new direction.I liked the settings and scenes quite a lot. Most of it happens (gasp) outdoors, away from labs or big cities (or sound stages with lots of green-screen CGI). Yes there are scenes in London particularly, but most of it happens in big-sky country settings like Australia, North Dakota, Alaska, the Canary Islands. It just feels more open and natural than so many other MCU movies. And this is reflected in the cinematography -- lots of long shots where the Eternals team is seen in the landscape rather than constant tight focus headshots. So in the big dust-up scenes between the Eternals and the Deviants (or among themselves) they don't even leave destroyed cities behind them, a nice change from the Avengers.This is also quite a visually strong movie. The signature superhero 'effect' for each Eternal is the way they call up filigrees of light in complex geometric pattern, especially Thena (Angelina Jolie). It's repetitive, but oddly I didn't get tired of seeing those because they are so effective and gracefully done. Their team costumes have handsome, attractive designs (better than their comic versions by far). The way Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) show off their powers is great: Ikaris' Superman-like fight in the air with the Deviants is the best we've seen done since Man of Steel (2013), and Makkari's super-speed is probably the best special effects work in the film. And, the end credits are just plain beautifully rendered.And about the acting: it's a big job to introduce a double fistful of entirely new characters all at once AND tell a good story. But it's been done before, with the X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy. Gemma Chan (Sersi) and Richard Madden (Ikaris) turn out to be the two main leads and they are just fine -- they've both had previous practice runs at this type of production and I got the impression that they know what's expected of them. Angelina Jolie was potentially an equally major character but she seemed to be a little underused -- or else her character's particular plot line just wasn't the central one in this rather sprawling multi-pronged story. Salma Hayek (Ajak), Don Lee (Gilgamesh), Lia McHugh (Sprite), Lauren Ridloff (Makkari), and Brian Tyree Henry (Phastos) are all fine too -- they totally fit. But I felt a bit disappointed by Kumail Nanjiani (Kingo) and Barry Keoghan (Druig) who just didn't seem to jell -- Keoghan especially wasn't convincing at all; he seemed to be way out of place in this type of thing.Lastly, the way the Celestials were used -- the giant cosmic beings who are Behind It All -- surprised me. A sneaky message that I haven't seen anyone else mention is that we now know what the Celestials are really all about. The big cosmic mission of the Celestials is ....... to breed more Celestials! That's their imperative, just like the simplest biological organisms. The particular way they do that is the mainspring of the storyline and I won't give any more away.I was reading Marvel comics way back when, when the Eternals were introduced, but I didn't follow them. They were the creations of the legendary Jack Kirby but after his long runs on the Fantastic Four and other classic titles, I thought he finally lost it: Frankly, his drawing became too crude and blocky, and his 'dialog' was even worse. He came up with names for them that are just silly mashups of gods and heroes from mythology (Ikaris for Icarus; Thena for Athena; Makkari for Mercury; Phastos for Hephaestus; Sersi for Circe; Gilgamesh for --- Gilgamesh; and Druig for who-knows-what). This Eternals movie is better than those comics by far."
2356,5,"Confusing and Disappointing The movie looks bigger than actually is...The plot is confusing and it seems of out place. Every single scene seems to be on a different chronological line.Also, the main motivation of the Eternals is just so superficial and vain, that makes this group look like a parody of the Avengers.Moreover, this movie portrays a lack of identity to humanity itself. The moments of history are poorly selected and rapidly included in the plot. The introduction and explanation of their true will it's goofy, and the climax is just as disappointing as the whole story.On the other hand, the CGI is decent, and some of the action scenes are good looking. Also, the inclusive and diverse range of heros is great, and personally, I was really disappointed with how they handled some of the characters, using them merely as inclusive cards and not showing more of their true identity.In conclusion, this movie only adds up as a Marvel timeline movie, that introduced a new group and flushed our minds with new upcoming events with the post credit scenes. Was expecting more from Chloe Zao and the cast as well, but it is what it is."
2357,8,"I really enjoyed!! It's a great movie and I can not understand why so many people hated. The one thing I actually didn't enjoyed was some too long scenes that made the movie a little bit slow in the middle. Beside that, the visual is amazing, the characters were well developed and Chloe Zhao did a great job."
2358,8,A different yet soothing experience from Marvel. Loved the movie. Chloe captured it with all its beauty. Eternals will hold a special place in my heart amongst other MCU films. The cinematography was excellent and new experience from MCU. The different cultures across the world are shown brilliantly.The way the characters were explored and established to the world of MCU was done greatly. There were much more character study which was always shortened for the sake of plot and action when it came to other movies from marvel and this approach makes it a completely distinguished storytelling.
2359,9,"Some marvel fans might not be ready for this. My title wasn't intended to mock marvel fans nor anyone who didn't like the movie. It's time for people to get out of their comfort zone, the known formula and embrace new angles. If you still don't like it, then that's fine, it's just not your thing.I didn't pick any pacing issues, the story was solid, the movie adds a lot for the MCU lore and there are no cheap CGI alien invasion in NYC, which is a huge bonus.This movie has a mature tone, hence the review's title, whereas I remember the same backlash on the release of Iron Man 3, which I'd say was the only Iron Man movie I loved."
2360,2,"The directing seemed good, acting seemed good but.... Lets start with the good. I do not have any issues with the director, she did a beautiful job bringing this script to life. The actors did a fine job as well. As for the script.... SPOILERS... Dear god where to start. The ""Deviants"" were about the worst and most bland Marvel Villains I have ever seen. Absolutely no substance or personality to them in any way. Their only purpose was so the main characters could have more fight scenes. Honestly they didn't even need to be in the movie it was so bad. Secondly, many people saw Richard Madsen and Kitt Harrington on the bill for this movie and that is why a lot of us wanted to see it despite its bad reviews. Well I'll tell you one thing, Kitt Harrington couldn't have been more wasted in this movie. He is in the movie for about 4 minutes and only as the boyfriend of the lead character. As for Rob Stark, you will be severely disappointed in what they do with his character. His actions legitimately make no sense at about the 1 hour and 40 minutes mark. Thats when the movie goes from ok to terrible. The plot is just so bad its hard to even believe that an executive at Marvel OR Disney didn't step in and demand a re-write? Also it was similar to Star Wars Episode VIII in all the ways people disliked that movie but I dont't feel like expanding on that as its been beaten to death already. I just cannot believe how poorly they missed the mark on villains. Falcon and the Winter soldier had better villains for heaven's sake. I actually feel bad for the cast and the Director... they did a great job with the script they were given but the plot was honestly so bad I began rooting for the main bad guy at the end so there wouldn't be a sequel. I can't imagine people clamoring for a sequel to this. I'd watch it though as I'm a mark for Marvel but this movie really did not need to be made."
2361,1,"Snooze, Snooze, Snooze. Paid Regal to sleep on the lounge chair. Very poor editing, direction, and a script that never knew where it was going.The cinematographer jotted down all the things he noticed in the Avenger series of movies and tried to replicate such shots in each and every scene.CGI was pretty good, but wasted on every scene being an unnecessary and epic fight that was unfortunately directed and shot by nincompoops.. The clear lack of which side is good and which side is bad could have been presented so much better with a moral perspective, but instead, viewers are left with confusion instead."
2362,6,"Visually Appealing, Storytelling Fails Can I make an advice to the writers? Can you tell the audience on the location and job description on what the other characters are doing before you randomly share where they are at. It feels so messy when you introduce the characters.If you are going to kill off a character, make us care about them first. It's so lame when a character is taken out early in the film and we have not had the time to invest.I liked the movie. I just can't stand how messy it feels."
2363,1,"Worst Marvel Superhero movie! A real waste of money for the bottom line. The worst director (Chloé Zhao) in history for a superhero movie !!... when you go to see a superhero movie, you are going to see action, science fiction, etc... no vindictive documentaries about gender struggles, politics or the whole The world can be a superhero! When a person goes to the movies, they want to escape from reality because real life is already very hard, why are you excited to see superheroes and you only see society's demands !! ... VOMITIVE!"
2364,8,"Has it's flaws, but still great. Act 1 of this movie was AMAZING, I was genuinly shocked by how much I was enjoying the beginning of this movie. The introduction to the characters, the action, and the story was spot on in the beginning. Act 2 was definitely a bit slower and was boring at times. However, it still contained interesting plotlines and still kept me entertained to a certain extent. Definitely the weakest act of the 3. Act 3 was not as exciting as it couldve been, but was still satisfactory and the action was great. Overall, the movie definitely has its flaws, and I can understand why some people think that the movie dragged, but for me, I really liked this movie. Probably not in my top 10, but definitely not in my bottom 10 either. Would recommend to watch."
2365,6,"A lot of potential, but... This movie had a lot of potential, however it was ruined by its execution. What was supposed to be a 2.5 hour movie ended up feeling like a 4 hour one... so much so, i had to close my eyes briefly halfway through just to take a break.Now the movie wasn't all bad. I personally loved seeing Gemma Chan take on one of the leading roles and truly appreciated the diversity I saw on the big screen. The humour was welcomed too with stunning visuals and great action sequences.Having said that, it took far too long to get to the point. I felt it was unnecessary to continuously jump back and fourth between the different time periods, or rather this could have been done more elegantly and not so sporadically. The entire storyline of Ikaris killing Ajak felt predictable and the death of the remaining deviant was anti climatic. I also found it disappointing how Kingo chose to sit the last battle out due to differences of opinion.The post credit scenes didn't impress me either, with Harry Styles joining the Marvel Universe as Eros (Thano's brother)... I'm literally speechless.6 out of 10 stars may even be too generous for this film..."
2366,9,"Can we trust our gods? This new team of super heroes is more than just ""different"" it's dealing with real deep issues one hardly ever finds in a comics book. It's more than the basic moral questions built into the comics genre, namely good versus evil; the responsibility coming with power; and who's watching over the watchmen? Which for themselves are deep moral questions that all the best comic based movies dealt with. This one asks us questions about free will; the overall sanctity of life; what is the nature of evolution? Do creatures that were created eternals and made to remain the same for eternity - Do they really remain the same?All these questions (and some I chose not to mention here to keep this thing from going way too long) push this comics saga into the realm of true science fiction. A realm only the X-Men visit regularly while other comics based movies only touch upon fleetingly. This is not a complaint - I love sci - fi with all my heart, I also love good comics, but the combination is really my personal favorite combination. Thing is, this calls for some very deft writing and directing - mission accomplished - It does make the movie slightly slower than most comics based movies but I found the story so riveting I hardly felt the time passing. The acting is superb, and I don't know who to commend because they all do their jobs as well as I could imagine it. The visuals, as some already mentioned here, are amazing, including some very nice timepieces that look spot on.Bottom line I loved it. It could easily sink into platitudes and slogans - but the writing and the acting kept it real. Go see it, but know in advance that you're stepping into uncharted territory."
2367,7,"Dragged a little in places But was not the worst film ever, I saw this today and enjoyed the scale of it and the ambitious storyline, however in places the pacing was a little off action wise.I'm going to assume most of the poor reviews here watched pirate copies because this was a great addition to the MCU's cosmic expansion.The poor comparisons being made between DC characters and members of the Eternals holds absolutely no weight, if you knew what you were talking about you'd know theres a plethora of flying superheroes who shoot beams from their eyes, super powered warrior women and speedsters. I've read the all the Eternals books enough to know how much of a task it was to pull this off onscreen and the director did a really really good job.If you've not seen it yet and don't know the backstory I suggest you just simply enjoy the story presented because it finally opens up the cosmic universe.I hope the future of the MCU gets even more stupendous because I definitely want to be taken there when I watch these films.I didn't expect to like many of the characters onscreen but they all worked for me as a fan of the books."
2368,5,"Long & Dry I have no comic book background to understand the story for this next phase for Marvel, which is probably why I was confused, and ready for the movie to be over and standup again. I enjoyed the diversity of the cast and their performances, their humor and how they played off each other, but I found the content of the movie itself dry. Long and dry, ready for it to be over. I also started getting sleepy so I know my investment in it was done. Maybe it could have been better had there been some kind of inter-multi-movie build up that has connections to characters we're familiar with and we're looking forward to saving the planet and humanity - again. This is like what? The third time? Wait no. Fourth?I found many things confusing. With Thanos we had so many movies building up to his appearance and defeat so that the final battle made sense. As someone coming to this super fresh - how, for example, does not intervening with Thanos before he fought the Avengers make it a human problem they're not allow to handle? Didn't Thanos threaten all those lofty world-building plans long before he met a human? Makes no sense. And Kit Harrington's backstory. Super confused. And for crying out loud - how did One Direction get in there?! I just sat there asking ""what is happening?!"" Last time I was this confused was Infinity Wars and the guy behind me who screamed with the introduction of Captain Marvel's logo. At least then I had someone to ask who/why."
2369,5,"Disappointing storyline Movie tried way too hard to give Eternals a back story which according me was their best attempt at it but came really short of the impact it could have created if it was centered around each character rather than the group.Definitely has got some lame story points but hey it's a superhero movie so brains and questions not allowed.I definitely liked the direction and also a bit of screenplay but story writers were really bad. Acting of the Actors/actresses were much to the point, no one was a disappointment.CGI was good like any other marvel movie, not outstanding but good. Although this movie would have been better without CGI."
2370,1,"This Is Terrible I don't see how anyone could find this movie interesting. My kids won some tickets to see this, none of us enjoyed it. It's excruciatingly long and feels like they just adlibbed the script. Worst movie i've seen in years!"
2371,8,Okay for a regular movie but terrible for a marvel movie Okay so getting a ticket for this I heard it wasn't the best but I didn't expect this I mean it's not a bad movie however for a marvel movie it sucks I mean there was barley any good action and the plot lost me several times I say Redbox it.
2372,9,"Not Just Another Marvel I thought this film had a very different feeling from most of the marvel films and that's ok! I think it was fresh, funny, smart, unique, and just simply entertaining. Why does it need to fit the ""marvel"" mold? Isn't that getting a bit weary? The CGI and storylines were great! I highly recommend!"
2373,3,"Most awful marvel movie Eternals is nothing but a boring and unforgettable movie. With every marvel movie I have seen in theaters I walk out feeling overwhelmed with excitement and mindblowing thoughts from the movie. This was the first time I walked out empty handed. The only thing that was worth my money was the 2 end credits. I also understand that this was the director's 3rd film ever made so I geuss if you look at it in that perspective it was impressive. Her third movie definetly shouldnt have been a marvel movie. This movie is very forgettable. I have no plans on watching it ever again nor do I plan on adding it to my Marvel DVD collectio, the sad part is this is the first time I have ever said that about any marvel movie."
2374,2,"Weakest movie of MCU The movie plot was so weak, loose script, they could have done so much better. So many superhero characters that most of character lost my interest as a viewer.Only good thing about the movie was Angelina Jolie."
2375,8,Very Interesting Loved the philosophical questions posed by this dense story and many characters in this diverse cast are compelling and endearing. Some very visually stunning moments as well. Hope it gets a sequel.
2376,10,"10/10 maybe one of the films of the year This film might be the film of the year, it was so exhilarating in fact that I got up out of my seat at the end of the film and stood there for 30 seconds just clapping and crying (tears of joy). The character development in this film is so touching that it even made my 13 year old son break out into tears! I cannot actually put into words how much I want the world to come to know this film Thank you for reading.-Chris x."
2377,8,"Gods among Heroes This movies was good, it was well made, but it was not a Superhero movie. These characters are not heroes, they are textbook mythology gods fighting among themselves and deciding what to do with our crazy world. People will hate on it, but it was a simply good movie."
2378,1,"Very boring and bad The movie is so boring, story is bad too. Except for seeing a beautiful Angelina and a few laugh scenes, its one of the worse marvel movies in my opinion. I regret paying to watch this in Cinema, I recommend you to skip it."
2379,7,Not bad The movie was solid. It had a good story and the characters were interesting but there were times throughout the film that the movie slowed down and not much was going on. The CGI also threw me off a couple of times throughout the film but I will say that the action scenes were great and the humor was good. This is not the MCU's best film but is also not the worst like many are saying.
2380,10,"absolutely loved it! The hype was definitely worth it, the cast were AMAZING and the diversity in this film blew me away...I LOVED IT!! I will most definitely be watching this again."
2381,9,"Something unusual from Marvel I was waiting for this film, I watched it. This is one of those stories that you don't expect to see in Marvel. This is not the origin of the character, it is not even his life path. It is something more complex, raising interesting questions to humanity on behalf of the extraterrestrial race. I dreamed of a similar story in the MCU. I am in awe of the beauty of this film and the story it tells. The cast is perfect. The actors play brilliantly and each character feels alive and necessary to the story. The epic nature of the battles is off scale. Everything is just fire."
2382,9,Refreshing change This film was a refreshing change for MCU films - I felt connected to the characters and their relationship as a family felt very intimate. I think introducing this many new characters in one film - was a success and I felt attached to them all. The fact it's different to other MCU films is very exciting as a lot of the other films have the same formula. Excited and hope to see these characters again.
2383,1,"Nearly the worst Marvel in the MCU I rate this movie just above the Hulk movie as worst MCU movie.The bouncing around the timeliness, the poor special effects, the fact that this movie had scenes that shouldn't be in a marvel movie...Very disappointed with it! I would not recommend!"
2384,3,Unfocused and a Chore to View. Marvel is struggling to make back their budgets in this next chapter of the Cinematic Universe. This was a real chore to get through with the excessive runtime and half-baked ideas; it was both vacant and numbing.There are too many characters and not fully articulated ideas thrown together in a frantic matter. Even the critics on Rotten Tomatoes on struggled with this one.
2385,6,"Eternals ""Abort"" Mission on Mother Earth. Unfortunately Eternals managed to fill an entire two and a half hours with mostly pretty pictures and pretty people, with the story and its logic, intrigue and engagement falling by the wayside, leaving Eternals to playout more like an over budget CW show rather than a quality MCU instalment.When compared to additions that have similar runtimes in the franchise, like The Avengers, Civil War, Infinity War, Endgame and even Age of Ultron, it becomes even clearer that Eternals is an inferior inclusion. It simply did not use its time effectively. With all the time it had, it didn't manage to establish any of the characters properly, accept maybe Sprite, which made their motivations inconsequential for the audience.How the Eternals ended up defeating the Celestial left much to be desired as well, as it was in a way the was very throwaway-like, somewhat convenient, and easy, while the fact that these Eternals can even defeat universe creating Celestials is rather questionable itself, and even though that may be based on the comic book material, the movie failed in making it a plausible feat.Also, these Celestials making mistakes like not erasing memories properly, creating creatures they can't control, and not establishing fail-safes to ensure that the Prime Eternals submit to their demands, feels incredibly stupid for beings that ought to have an out of this world level of intellect.Perhaps the best part of the movie was the battle between Makkari and Ikaris; the imagery there was stunning, while these two characters were also perhaps the best in the movie, along with Sprite.In the end, Marvel Studios under Kevin Feige is incapable of making ""bad"" movies at this point, therefore, Eternals is not a bad movie, however, its simply not good enough. Its story is flawed, humor at most parts is misplaced/not funny as usual, has very little character development, lacks energetic engagement, and has a forgettable score, but, the cinematography, some of the action scenes and the actors were good at different levels, while the overall project was adequately decent.6.4/10."
2386,5,The same It is the same theme throughout the disney movie to kill humanity and another theme is that the man with man is enough of the same killing humanity they create another world the same as disnep.
2387,9,"Uncharted This film takes you into uncharted territory for Marvel movies. There is a sense of a subplot taking place that might make you think too much. As with other Marvel films it's beautiful and action-packed. The diversity of the cast is amazing and as I noted with the previous Marvel movie, I want more of it."
2388,1,Ugh Terrible...watch as Disney destroys yet another classic. Terrible acting and continuity. Relying on pointless battles and CGI. Not recommended........
2389,10,"New fresh and enormous Director has done a great work. I enjoyed this so much today, it has connected to our hearts... Personally I liked every eternals character inside this movie. It has love and emotions."
2390,5,"An okay start to the new marvel cinematic story I left it feeling like what it was. A filler to build the next story in the marvel universe. It was nothing special. Great CGI. Acting was okay. Overall somewhat enjoyable, but if you aren't in a rush to watch it that is fine. Catch it when it becomes available on Disney+."
2391,1,Cool. People with superpowers beating up dragons. Amazing. People with superpowers beating up dragons... so cool. Like and of course they win. Like come on. Super hero movies are just getting worse and worse.
2392,1,"I watched it Yes, I watched. It is bad, long and messy. Storyline is filled with plotholes where you the watcher is in need to explain the movie for the movie.The reason for these heros not helping during endgame - I'm not impressed by the movies non-explanation for that one and there is too much examples like this throughout this movie.It's a lazy-done movie. Don't waste your precious time on this."
2393,8,"Can't understand the negative reviews While Eternals is not my favorite MCU movie, it is definitely not the ""disaster"" the critics reviews make it out to be. It was a thoroughly enjoyable movie with gorgeous visuals."
2394,4,It's doesn't accepted by marvel studio Not good even browing movie A supper hero doesn't do any sajis he fight infront of anyme Icris character does not like a supper hero.Marvel one of the boring movie it's doesn't accepted by the marvel studio.
2395,9,"Fits Well With Phase 4 MCU I really like the direction they are going with the MCU by changing the formula from standard action to more cerebral stories, that of course still have some action. I feel like this fits very well with Loki and will set up future stories. I also love that I have no clue where they are going with the MCU. We knew they were leading up to Thanos years before, but this time they have multiple big antagonists they can go with, or maybe someone we've not yet seen."
2396,7,"Not as terrible as the reviews suggest It's an okay movie really, falls short of generally the MCU standard. The CGI is meh sometimes, the alien- dogs look fake but overlooking the technical flaws, this is actually a decent movie and worth watching. The critics reviews are too harsh. I will say not everyone would like this but most of you will."
2397,3,"Disappointing plot, but great special effects The movie in itself was the weakest of the most recent Marvel series. The plot is confusing, the story is not creative, the dialogues are boring with exception to few funny jokes. I was surprised to see how little Angelina Jolie spoke or acted. She was a mummified character in the plot. I did not give zero because the special effects and picture was well done. But really, it was a very bad movie for Marvel standards."
2398,5,"Why break the MCU formula, that's why we watch the movies. I watch Marvel movies that act like a Marvel movie, and add to the MCU's lore. This was a Marvel movie that barely acted like a Marvel movie and added a lot more plot holes and inconsistencies to the MCU than anything else. This should've been a 2 minute long YouTube video with Kevin Feige saying ""The Celestials exist, and so does Black Knight and Star Fox/Eros. Have a great day."""
2399,7,"Enjoyable but overly ambitious Let me preface this review by stating that I'm a big MCU fan who has enjoyed the connected storytelling that these movies, and now shows, share. The Eternals moves the storytelling along in a more cosmic sense, but it was a mixed bag result.So, does The Eternals deserve the worse ratings in MCU history along with being worse than the worse of DC's offerings? Not really. It is easily better than at least several MCU movies.The plot is very ambitious to tell in a movie format, but it is pretty straightforward. Time jumps are clearly labelled and necessary for character development as we track these characters over 7,000 years. If you're confused by an obviously labelled time jump, you have other problems to deal with. The protagonists are compelling but there are too many of them for an origin story. The story is more mature with less humor than other MCU offerings, so this might turn you off by it. But, ultimately, it is a story about humanity and what it means to be human and somehow be influenced by it (or not) even if you're immortal.The cinematography is gorgeous, but it doesn't always work well with CGI, especially in darker settings. I feel the the use of Stagecraft (how they film Mandalorian) would've been a better fit for this movie. I would even say that the story of The Eternals would've been better served as a Disney+ show.I enjoyed the movie for what it is: an MCU origin story that introduces us to new heroes, how they are influenced by humanity, and the bigger perspective of how the cosmic side of the MCU fits in. The Eternals is going to be divisive but, fortunately, there are no cringe-worthy ""Martha"" moments to face palm over."
2400,4,"Watching this movie felt like an eternity Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer."
2401,1,"No... just no! Generic characters. Stupid plot. Boring. DCEU style action. Weak acting. The characters were so generic, boring and uninspiring that it was torture. Good films make me coming out of the theater feeling inspired and wanting to change a viewpoint a have on the world but this film didn't do that and only made me feel confused and pissed off. Do NOT watch this film at all costs!"
2402,9,"This movie is beautifully made and has its purpose!!! I think everyone should give it a go to this movie in theator!! The story is great and i felt connected to the charactors, dont listen to the critcs, i dont know, what wrong they saw in it. 9/10, Makkari was great!!!"
2403,6,"Doesn't feel like Marvel This is one of those movies that I don't know what to think about. It definitely doesn't feel like a Marvel movie at all. I understand that they are trying to change things up, but I don't think most people are liking that decision. Another aspect that bothered me was that the majority of the film was the characters discussing there plan. There were only a few action sequences throughout the entire film. I just feel like the pacing of the movie wasn't the best. The cinematography was great, however some of the VFX shots were pretty bad. Some of it looked very fake. I did really enjoy the soundtrack for the film. Overall, the film was entertaining and there were definitely a few scenes that were badass. I wouldn't highly recommend Eternals, but I don't think it's a waste of time watching it."
2404,10,"Eternals was different level of marvel movies I wasn't going to see the movie after reading all negative reviews from people I went and not disappointed it's totally different level and twist It's not about avengers ect something interested me and telling everyone go and see it , I have seen worst Still worth it ."
2405,10,"Impressive,I Really Enjoyed This Wow Mannn. This is a film that has been waiting for a long time That I saw in the theater after a while, really good I really enjoyed this Don't think about the rumors, this is a good movie!!"
2406,9,"A feast of emotions This is the first Marvel movie I want to watch again in a theater.It's so beautiful and complex. Yes it's not perfect as if any Superhero movie was perfect. Too many new characters, a VERY abstract villain, silly flashbacks and the acting can feel too theatrical at times. But it has engaging characters, some funny scenes instead of continuous one liners and real emotional moments. It expands the story possibilities into a cosmic world and for once has something resembling a true love story.It was weirdly reminiscent of the good aspects of Twilight to me.People need to stop relying on RT critics numbers because this movie is far superior to many recent Marvel movie. Antman & the Wasp was a big low for me with boring new characters, the most insipid villain and barely any action. I hated Captain Marvel and its predictable twists and ugly action scenes, Black Widow was more generic than a Mission Impossible sequel and I thought the Falcon/ Winter soldier show was a total disaster of forced wokeness and pseudo political issues.Yes the Marvel movies we all expect are like Shang Chi: shiny action, wild chases, down to Earth characters with a joke a minute, OTT CGI of monsters or robots and a vague family drama we can all relate too. But I don't think Eternals is an accident, I think it offers an alternative and a more mellow adult vibe to the usual fairground rides...Sure it would have worked better as a Disney + TV show because you probably needed 5/6 hours to truly tell this story with a proper pace, understand the characters and feel the sense of what they went through during thousand of years rather than just jumping between flashbacks, character introductions and Deviants scenes until the clunky rushed climax.But I absolutely loved the effort. (plus I can't wait for Black Knight!)"
2407,1,"Pandering & Pretentious Here's the thing, I respect the attempt at diversity and I support taking the mcu into a new, different era/tone. All that would have been great, **if** Eternals had managed to carry that off. But bottom line is this movie should have worked harder on its story instead of trying to pander-by-numbers to diversity. As a person of color, I find the blatant ploy to get audiences into seats so calculating that it's offensive.Some critics and audiences will try to spin this as a flawed, but brilliant and deep movie. I don't buy it. Everything in this movie but the vfx is weak, and the existential conversation is shallow and conflicting if not nonsensical. Maybe Marvel initially thought that pandering to the Chinese box office by having a Chinese born director is a sure fire way to hedge its bets against this experiment, and maybe critics and audiences think that having an Oscar winning director must mean the film is secretly good ... right? The critics will bend over backwards to shine up Chloe Zhao (just look at their glowing praise for the tepid Nomadland), and even now they're trying to separate Zhao from this film's failures, a generosity that they don't seem to apply equally to male directors, especially white ones. So before y'all complain that the film's blowback is just a form diversity bashing or sexism (yes, there is definitely some of that), but maybe sometimes a dud is just a dud. A $200 million dollar dud at that too.If you like really weird and rambling unfocused pretentious attempt of ""cerebral blockbuster,"" you might like this. But people go to Marvel films to be entertained, to be inspired, to actually care about the story and characters. This film is not it. Beyond some hardcore Marvel and Harry Styles Stans, and beyond some who want to pretend they're enlightened, tasteful, evolved supporters of diversity, I truly don't understand how the average audience is supposed to connect with this bland mediocre film.But sure, let's throw a bland sex scene in there to be edgy and different (even if it doesn't serve any story purpose)! Desperate. You don't need sex to sell even a moderately good movie."
2408,8,"It's a good movie I think if this came from any other Studio than Marvel, it would have great reviews. It was a good movie. I'm glad I went to see it in the movies and look forward to the next installment with Eternals."
2409,1,Left a lot to be desired... Just wasn't a fun or memorable experience overall.Characters lacked depth and it gave you a sense of apathy for most of the film.The most likeable character was Kingo's valet.
2410,7,"Amazing... but it's what I expected The visuals, casting, and acting were all phenomenal. However, the plot failed to captivate me. It reminded me of Avengers Assemble, but on a much larger scale. The aliens landing on Earth and then the superheroes saving the planet did feel somewhat repetitive.But, as I previously stated, this is partially forgotten when watching the incredible special effects, visuals, and Richard Madden on the big screen. Words cannot express how realistic looking and visually stunning this film was. Kumail Nanjiani's character's one-line jokes were definitely needed to lighten the mood, which many of the moviegoers appreciated.SPOILERS This was the part that confused me the most - how was this happening at the same time as Loki, and Falcon And The Winter Soldier? I had the impression that the Celestial demonstrated the existence of a more powerful being than the Watcher and the Time Keeper, but is this true? The film once again proved that the Earth and any other planet in the universe could be easily destroyed, if not by Thanos, then by the Celestial, and who knows, perhaps an even more powerful being will appear next."
2411,7,"A different direction for MCU Honestly I liked it and I also do understand the mixed reviews from critics. See this film is totally different from the previous 25 films in the MCU. It's a shift towards something else, a different mythos. Chloe Zhao (if you have seen her earlier films) makes a certain kind of cinema. Seeing Eternals it feels she was given a good amount of creative control. The film might feel slow in the 1st half because of the immense world building it has to do with so many characters and myths involved. It still does it reasonably well. It's very unlike a traditional Marvel film with the cheek in tongue humor and a formulaic approach to film making which works incredibly well. The film has a lot to cover in 150 mins, and I felt it did cover everything to some extent but still left me wanting for more.The film has glorious visuals, it's just a feast for the eyes. The film takes you around the globe in different times, in different empires as it walks through the history of Eternals while. It's just cool to watch knowing what all the Eternals did from the start of mankind. Was pretty excited to see the GOT boys Richard and Kit, and they don't disappoint. It was eerie watching them say 'I love you Sersi""(Those who know, know). Angelina Jolie was breathtaking to watch, I simply couldn't take my eyes off her. Yet again Marvel Villain dissapoints me, as the Deviants don't have any character to them as they simply are like beasts. Post credit scenes are cool and give a great insight on the future. I'm psyched for the next chapter in the MCU gallore as they explore more amazing characters I grew up reading. Sure this wouldn't rank in my top 5 Mcu movies, but Eternals is not as bad as the reviews have made it sound. An absolute must watch for a Marvel fan."
2412,7,Mid-Tier Marvel Movie This was a gorgeous film. The cinematography in a majority of the scenes was mind blowing. Where most people see a problem with this movie is it's pacing and lack of context for the characters. They did the best they could to create enough story that informed the audience without to much filler. Where this movie lacked in character development it gained in great action sequences and an intriguing future for the MCU.
2413,5,"Waste of time ""Eternals"" title sounds like a pretty cool movie but the actual story/plot and everything else is really disappointing and awful . It's not even a one time watch movie unless you are a marvel fan ."
2414,7,"Not the best film in the marvel collection. Went into this film not knowing about the source material,found it entertaining but too long.it got bogged down into many side stories and only some of the characters I cared about.do not leave right at the end of the film credits."
2415,10,"As spectacular as it gets Woe unto the people that did not enjoy this movie. Obviously something is wrong there. Action packed, likable characters, great story and exposition, spectacular effects, several good twists. WTH was there not to enjoy? Incredibly entertaining. Didn't care one whit either way about the diversity or the gay kiss. I can't recommend this movie enough. Ignore the haters of virtually everything except trash movies like Joker."
2416,3,"No - just no Slooooooow, hokey and weird - honestly can't believe this has the Marvel label - too many poorly developed stories going on - tried to have something for every diverse group and ended up giving nothing meaningful to anyone - I left the theater feeling like I had wasted 3 hours of my time. I gave the movie a 3 because I liked the character Gilgamesh and of course they kill him off."
2417,8,"Guardians of the Galaxy (Incognito) Eternals is MARVEL's much anticipated ensemble movie post The Avengers saga. It is a part of phase 4 of the MARVEL cinematic universe and was released with high anticipation. It has been receiving a lot of mixed reviews but somehow I liked it and to my surprise I liked it better than Shang Chi. Eternal's may not be the perfect MARVEL movie, but it does have pretty much all the classic MARVEL characteristics.While the main plot of the Eternals occurs in the post 'blip' MARVEL era, it also connects to some of the major historic events of human civilization. Some of the mythological references to the characters work well. But the difficult part is to introduce another set of superheroes doing the same things as Avengers. The story tries to explain why they were not involved in the previous battles on earth, but it is just not convincing enough. Eternals suffers from the lack of character introduction just like DC's Justice League a few years ago. There are too many things thrown at you at once and for most of the film I didn't even realize how many Eternals there were forget about what their superpowers are. I believe Eternals would have worked better as a separate universe in itself like Xmen. Apart from a few, most of the characters lack chemistry between them.Despite the above criticism, Eternals manages to entertain somehow thanks to Kumail Nanjiani and Bryan Tyree Henry's comic timing. The director has made full use of Nanjiani's comedy background and also South Asian heritage. There are many scenes aimed at pleasing the Indian audience and they work well. Of course there is forced diversity at times, but that is how the future looks like for the big movie studios. Richard Madden and Gemma Chan as Sersi do a decent job but I personally didn't feel so emotionally connected to them as the leaders of the pack. Angelina Jolie's character loses itself in the mysterious vibe created around her. Ma Dong-seok and Lauren Ridloff are pretty impressive. Harish Patel's role is a pleasant surprise to all the Indian audience out there. Although Kit Harrington barely gets any screen time in this movie, I believe he will get more in the upcoming ones.Eternals may be a forced addition to the MARVEL's universe but it is thoroughly entertaining and I hope it does get better from now on."
2418,6,Excellent but.... There is something in the movie which doesn't feel like marvel i mean you'll fell like that I am not watching movie other than marvel movie it's dark and drama which i think they have made over.
2419,5,"Eh Reminded me of a setup episode of ""the boys"" some cool insight to References from other MCU movies. Other than that kind of dragged on could've been better but was good for what it was. Wouldn't bother seeing in theaters."
2420,10,"Let The Haters Hate Don't let the haters deter you. In this day and age, people just look for something to complain about.This is an EPIC Marvel movie that sets the stage for years to come. Beautiful shot, well acted, and well written."
2421,7,"Good but not GREAT This movie had all the ingredients of a hit. However, it was the initial introduction of several new characters to those who have not read the comics. Because of that I was not invested into any of them. This would have been an amazing 2nd movie, if we had had an origin story that drew us in a little more."
2422,1,"Worst Marvel Movie of All Time Huge Marvel fan, but this was absolute garbage. First movie I've ever gotten up and left the theater mid-movie. I love most of the actors and actresses in this movie but I think the casting was terrible. People will go see this one because its Marvel and for all the big names, but will go home grossly disappointed. Do not waste your money going out and seeing this."
2423,7,"Not a bad film just doesn't hit the MCU bar Let me start by saying this is not a bad movie the problem is Marvel has set a very high bar and this doesn't quite clear it. Marvel have generally struck an excellent balance between action, adventure, comedy and excellent casting amd that balance is lacking in this movie.Now the film itself, there is a really lot to unpack and digest so chances are I don't cover everything but I do need to include spoilers to give a fair review. Firstly the movie is long and generally has less action than typical MCU films at least until the final third. In itself it's not really a problem, you are really getting the background to the eternals, why they are here and why they've never shown up in the MCU universe so far. The problem it has is that the characters are not always that interesting, some of them are actually dislikable (Druig Inparticular), others get limited screen time and bizarrely one character and his sidekick become slapstick comedy whilst the rest of the movie takes itself extremely seriously. You then have issues as the movie progresses that it kills off some of its more interesting characters and makes another a villian so by the end of the movie you are left with mostly supporting characters who are quite bland or you are not invested in due to limited screen time or that their characters are not very likeable.Now more into the characters, Gemma Chan is likeable and solid in her role but she lacks the charisma to carry a movie or be a lead - this is something Marvel has typically done very well in past so it stands out. Richard Madden is very good but the character arc is a disappointing bunt ultimately necessary one. Selma Hayek is never a lead but she does well in her limited screen time. Angelina jolie has lead films before but here is limited to a background character and not a particularly likeable one. The Indian character is completely out of place as a really powerful eternal that just becomes out of place (but welcome) comedic relief, yet he oddly disappears for the films final battle because he chooses not to participate. The other characters like the really smart gay character, the deaf speedster get very limited screen time so you don't care about them. The less said about Druig the better I cannot be the only one who was desperate for him to be killed off! Finally you have Kit Harrington again with very limited screen time and a washed up former boy band star appearing in a cameo - who thought that would be a good idea?Overall it's better than Black Widow/Hulk/Thor 2 and has a darker more drier feel to it (think Dr Strange) so it's worth a watch especially when it's clearly going to join other MCU teams (my money on Thor/Guardians/Dr Strange) but lowering expectations so you are not hugely disappointed."
2424,1,"another fine mess The Eternals is an over long tedious mess that drops another project in the MUC's shallow grave. It's in good company, Widow, Ten rings and the streaming shows. If marvel continue down this path, hiring people whose only purpose is to virtue signal and destroy the characters that made the MUC so entertaining, it will club itself to death."
2425,10,"Amazingly Goood Although its different from normal marvel movies it stands out with splendid visuals and color grading, amazing scenery and plot. I loved the character development and it was the perfect balance of romance, action and drama. The plot twists were also unexpected and despite being a long movie (156min) i never got bored and i enjoyed it a lot!"
2426,9,It was good film I dont know why people are giving low ratings.Its good film.I've just watched it.I was skeptical due to reviews but went anyways and yes its less of action and more focus on character buildup is there. But its good not bad. I'll give 9 stars.
2427,1,"Cram as much in. But nothing of interest. I'm not even sure what the story was aiming at. Sooo, they are ok with killing billions of lives?But they won't get involved in small skirmishes? Or maybe they're supposed to be hands off, but in the process of being hands off; they became the gods of ancient civilizations?Several scenes felt like they were forcing the ""burden of duty"" aspect of each character. We get it- they've been on Earth for 7000 years.The whole thing felt like a nod at being as inclusive as possible, throw in a couple of great cinematic scenes and then go back to being inclusive, and then figure up a solution in 4 minutes. Plot twist? Meh, just throw those in whenever and wherever."
2428,1,"All the emotion falls flat I went into this ignoring the negative criticisms hoping I could find something enjoyable out of this, but I didn't like a single thing in this move. The emotion fell completely flat, the humor was cheesy and forced, the villain was extremely lame, and over all, Eternals seemed to be living a pointless and purposeless existence which made this entire film feel purposeless. Unlike, Shang-Chi, I left the theatre feeling like I still didn't know any of the characters, nor was I excited to see what the future had in store for them."
2429,3,"Not A Marvel Movie like ... Some of character fake and look like dc character . Example : thena = Wonder woman Superman = ikaras Etc Story = Average , music = not good , movie = look like local people doing this."
2430,7,"Cosmology Subversion There are many things that could be said about this movie.As a story that takes place in the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, Eternals is certainly very experimental compared to the others. The directing by Chloé Zhao is very well-crafted, so is the photography and the whole aesthetic of each environment.The characters are loosely-based on the comic book versions they take inspiration from, even though only three are really developed and memorable: them being Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikaris and Angelina Jolie as Thena.Everything that happens feels genuine and natural, for the most part: the progression of the story, the conflict between characters as well as the sequences involving the Celestials.The pacing could have been handled in a different way. Sometimes, the movie gets too slow as it gets harder to connect to what's going on. Also the tone of the movie is not as cohesive as you would expect. The visual effects are spectacular during certain scenes, while are just okay during others.In the end, this movie manages to expand the cosmology of the MCU, thanks to its brilliant twists and turns, but is perhaps too dark and gloomy to be appreciated by the majority of the public. It's a blockbuster flick that works to a certain extent."
2431,10,"Great, wonderful, amazin Moving, emotional, epic: Eternals is probably the best Marvel movie ever. I was overwhelmed in the cinema. An adult diversion in the Marvel universe, superbly told with great characters and believable characters with dark sides. An epic story with real surprises and twists: I enjoyed every minute of Eternals."
2432,7,"I enjoyed it! Enough I suppose. The action sequences were pretty cool to look at too, some good grand fun! And the ending was a real shocker with the main villain, just wait and see!There were characters in this movie that I really liked individually! Especially Phastos (who knocked it out of the park with the humor, along with Kingo). So good acting for the most part, except for Angelina Jolie, who is not good at being sad and at crying. Plus, why did they cast someone who looks so much like Bucky/Sebastian Stan?? They could've easily chosen someone other than Richard Madden to play his role.The main issue with the film though is that it's so jumbled for someone who doesn't follow the comic books closely enough. I found myself getting confused and not fully comprehending the mythology, leaving me with many questions and making it so that I was loosely following the film, instead of being on the same page with it. Some of the character motivations and relationships didn't make much sense as well, and I feel like earlier MCU films are easier to follow since most are already familiar with the characters and their origin stories are simpler to understand. I didn't care for the deviants one bit either. Overall, not bad, but definitely not my favorite Marvel film or one I'd watch again. It was meh, and I expect greatness from most of not all Marvel films. Maybe I shouldn't anymore."
2433,1,Worst movie (not just marvel) ever Unbearably boring. Characters are dull and fail to keep you interested in the story one of the characters shoots beams from his fingers it's stupid and less expected of marvel only thing worth in this movie is the visuals in 3d else it's a very poorly directed and time waste movie. Marvel please focus on good projects and try not to just push any thing to the audience. Soundtrack is nice.
2434,5,Boring. Not fun. Lots and lots of boring story. Not fun. Fake Greek gods makes for a snooze festival. Didn't need the sex scene. I was pointless. Post credit scenes were also weak. Overall the worst marvel so far. Get lots of candy and caffeine if you plan on going.
2435,10,"Loved this more than shang-chi I Don't know why critics are tearing apart such a good film. I loved watching this movie. I was funny as much as every marvel film. Every one did a great job. I loved shang chi, but I loved eternals more than that."
2436,7,"Phase 4 looks to have plenty to offer There is plenty to like about this movie. It looks great and has some brilliant action sequences. However, it is mostly setting up Phase 4 of the marvel universe and suffers from long and convoluted story telling as a result. Like Thor and its first sequel this is a good film but could have been better."
2437,9,"Marvel Tries Something New - Fans Turn On Them (Figures...) The hate that this film is receiving is very disappointing. A diverse, well-casted group of actors with stunning visuals, an Oscar-winning director, and what do people have a problem with - the plot?? I've been trying to wrap my head around why most reviews are calling the plot ""a mess"" and ""too complicated"" and the only thing I can come up with is that people were expecting more of the same from Marvel. I am a huge MCU fan, but most of their plot points up until now have been fairly cut-and-dry and easy to follow. (Probably to also grab a younger audience.) This one is not. They are trying to explain the origin of the universe while introducing an ensemble cast of 10+ new characters, so yes the runtime is long at 2 hours and 37 minutes, but I think they did a beautiful job introducing each of these characters. The film itself is character-driven and each of them grappling with their own immortality and humanity.So, if you are looking for another simple plot with tons of action scenes or explosions that your 6-year old will love, this isn't it. You have to pay attention for this plot to make sense. They are trying something new with this film and I am loving it! Not your everyday Marvel movie, which is a good thing."
2438,2,"3 hours you will never get back This was a huge disappointment. Totally boring story, actors clearly not motivated, chaotic script. The hugest disappointment this year. The 2nd star only for the production itself. And please: create some good monsters for crying out loud!"
2439,6,"Good movie but I think... Well, l'm a Marvel fan and I watched all Marvel movies.And i think it's one of the lower-tier Marvel movies. But it has great CG and characters. It seemed to tell the story of the characters better than I thought, and I wasn't bored at all. I don't think I want to see it again,but I don't think this movie deserves to be criticized this much."
2440,7,"Eternals - A Different MCU Film A good one & totally a different type of film compared to the other MCU films.The celestial mythology is explained in a really good way. The visuals were excellent.The emotional bond between the Humans and the Eternals is portrayed in a really good way by the director.Just felt bored at some scenes. But that can be acceptable as this one is the first team-up movie of the Eternals.Finally, a good one to watch."
2441,3,"People need to take of their MCU glasses. I dont understatement how this movie still has an 6.9 rating. Not evetything with a Marvel brand had to be review this wellicht, just admit it. This movie was far from good."
2442,1,"Marvel in name It's a far cry from what it can be. Good Effects but honestly it could have been better, in my personal opinion. The sexual scene is completely unnecessary and sets a disturbing precedent for future movies in the MCU. It's bad enough you can't watch any decent TV Show or Movie anymore with a sexual moment or 5 giving you a swift sucker punch. I get that some people like to see that kind of nonsense, but this is a superhero movie about cosmic beings. Not some Pornographic Parody. Not everyone is comfortable seeing that kind of stuff and for those who get really uncomfortable with such subject matters: it doesn't help limiting possible Entertainment choices to Childrens Tv Show and That One Film. Not everyone wants to see sex, and it's everywhere these days to the point it pauses the damn plot. This isn't Game of Thrones and we certainly don't need to be seeing the MCU morph into Porn Plaza. It shouldn't be that a marvel superhero movie is suddenly a pornographic movie with two conventionally attractive people going at it. It's Marvel, not Playboy."
2443,1,Definitely a giant mess From start to finish you wish you had made better life choices. The director has no idea of the source material. I highly doubt one of these reviews over 5/10 have read the comic. Having said that it boring bloated and just painful. Spend time with your family doing anything else but seeing this disaster.
2444,1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen Waste of time ....don't watch.The director is very bad ...silly story ...bad performance ....every thing is actualy very bad...nothing exciting ...I can't understand how did a company like marvel do something like this ...
2445,8,"Dont go with the reviews, its a great Marvel Movie Just watched Eternals and first thing i would like to mention is how spectacular the movie was and it will help to give marvel phase 4 a completly new direction ... all 10 characters did a great job in building the story and the conflicts between them is exactly what works for it... The only demerit point i would like to share is the character of Kit Harrington's black Kinght that is still far from introduced but hopefully we will be able to see more of it in future..."
2446,10,Loved every second This movie was so good direction was awesome and CGI was so good Chloe did an amazing job with this film and this cast .I don't know why people are rating it low it is a wonderful movie .The post credit and end credit were awesome So go watch it and experience the magic and decide how it was don't believe in these critics review.
2447,5,"Screw you Jon Snow Creating a film for Jon snow to love a character called Cersei and play second fiddle to his younger brother was about the most amusing part of this film, oh no except for one directions accent. Marvel have become a people pleasing soulless mess. 3 films on the spin to either be awful or boring. There's nothing fresh here, some ideas that seem like theft... the deaf flash?Average film with poor casting, played out effects, bland characters, slow meandering story."
2448,8,"Was a good film! All in all, the film was good. Not great, or amazing, just a good film that I enjoyed at the cinema.Story was good, I liked the characters, effects were top notch as always with Marvel and I wasn't bored once.The reason I believe that the film hasn't had the best reviews is that it didn't once give me that ""Marvel"" or ""Avengers"" feel. If I didn't know who the characters already were, I could be fooled into thinking it was just a stand alone fantasy film.But on the whole, definitely worth a watch!"
2449,4,"Very Meh Before writing this I read some of the reviews of other users and I am honestly happy some people really liked the movie. To me, it was a bit of a miss.In my opinion, great movies are the ones that, even if develop in a completely unrealistic universe, still have a firm grip on reality. Usually, I can 'forgive' unrealistic storylines for the sake of entertainment, but there is always a line; and this line is made very bold when events are happening on current day Earth. I think this movie didn't satisfy me because it crossed this line too many times.Spoilers Ahead!The whole storyline really had no stakes. You obviously know the Eternals must succeed against the emerging Celestial (even though I am left wondering what their plan was after succeeding as they went against orders from one of the strongest beings in the universe). I am guessing this is why they also incorporated the Deviants as a way to create a more tangible danger. However, they don't do anything to carry the story forward and the ending is so underwhelming. This sentiment of unreached potential is carried throughout the entire movie.The random appearance of the Deviants, while initially interesting, later looks like just a convenient way to get the Eternals back together for the bigger fight. The betrayal inside the group had no real impact on me as I didn't have time to know and get attached to the character.To me it felt like this storyline would have been better explored via a series. I understand series get a lot less commercial success but they tried to cram too much stuff in one single movie, so nothing gets the real exposition that it deserves. By the end of the movie I am left with some many questions; and not the good kinds. Why did the Celestial spare (for now) Earth. How did no one from Earth get notified of this huge figure-looking-thing literally coming out of the ground. Same thing with the first fight against the Deviant. Why do the Eternals need planets with a high population of intelligent life to emerge (I know it was briefly touched on but no where need enough for it being one of the main story elements). I have so many other questions that should have been answered in the movie.I remember leaving the theater thinking that, if it had been a DC movie, this would have been fine, but being a Marvel movie, it really missed the mark.Anyways, final verdict for me, I would go and watch it if you get the chance just in case future movies decide to get better and work off this storyline, but I wouldn't rush to the movie theater for it. You can easily watch this at home. Go watch Dune in theaters instead."
2450,1,"The worst Movie from Marvels factory till date. A very badly scripted movie with no particular motiveMarvel's save the world concept has taken a back seat in this movie and there is no particular stand point in the movieCharacters are loosely created with no proper elevation to their super powersThe movie CG is worst with no excitementActress like Angelina Jolie is wasted and left with one dialogue "" I remember "" which seemed too stupid at timesI first thought Captain Marvel was the worst but this movie beats it like 5-0Don't waste you time on this movie, very bad or worst of Marvels factory yet."
2451,6,"Exceptional visuals, fails to live up to hype. My God I was hyped for this movie. Finally, celestials get the representation they deserve (looking at you GOTG2). I guess that's my fault, i got sucked into the promotional material and now my disappointment is even greater.Let me preface this by saying that Eternals is by no means a BAD film. It's pretty solidly okay. It has some really weird decisions (using American Sign Language in 5000 BCE, for example), but is still worlds better than T:DW or AM&TWEternals would have clearly been better suited for a long-form medium like a tv series; much is skipped to streamline the story to a lofty near-three hours. Inconsequential details such as the name of the main antagonist deviant are omitted in favor of the MCU's first sex scene-one that is wholly unneeded to frame the depth of the relationship between the characters involved. Overall, some strange liberties are taken and whether or not you like them remains to be seen."
2452,9,"Not your typical marvel movie, but make up your own opinion. Wow. I'm really confused as to why this movie has garnered so much hate. I personally loved it and encourage anyone reading this to go into the movie with no expectations and form your own opinion. Mild/vague spoilers ahead.I get it's not your typical marvel movie, and it's very different than what we've seen before in the MCU, but it was honestly really good. Marvel movies can't keep following this typical unlikely rise of a hero trope that has become known otherwise they'd eventually grow to become predictable to an extent. This movie still had its predictable moments and familiarities with that theme, but it was something new and different than what has been done in the MCU. And it really tackles some philosophical question in a fun way but can definitely get you thinking about a lot. Plus, it opens up so many doors with how the rest of the MCU could proceed. The visuals were also insane!For those saying that the characters lacked depth, I disagree. I get that they definitely had some barriers to overcome with introducing a cast of entirely new characters with completely different stories than what we have come to know and in some ways the characters may have seemed a little rushed. However, it's quite the task to introduce that many characters and make you care at all for them and I think it was handled pretty well considering the circumstances. I also think that the emphasis on each of these non-human beings' humanity and the navigation of morals/ethics that the plot is centered around is something to really appreciate. And there is no way you could argue that the movie was rushed with a 2.5 hour screen time, to fit more in would have forced them to create the movie in two parts which just isn't reasonable if the movie isn't infinity war//endgame. Chloe Zhao definitely had quite the project to tackle, but to me it was extremely enjoyable because it was different. The actors were phenomenal as well at portraying their characters and just overall an outstanding cast.Overall, the movie was definitely worth seeing but forget what you know about marvel and consider this a different entry point into the same universe. It's its own story and yes will connect with the MCU, but is separate from the lore we have come to know up until the climax. There is much to appreciate about this movie if you drop the expectations and really really cool characters to come to know and character development to look forward to in future films.9 stars because honestly I really liked how different it was than the rest of marvel movies but also what it contributes to the future of the MCU. I just wish it hadn't been as predictable and didn't have some of its cheesy moments (as most/all marvel movies do)."
2453,10,"A whole new direction for the MCU This movie is divisive, and I can see why. It asks huge moral questions of its characters, therefore it's audience - rather than the more cut and dry ""good guys vs bad guys"" of previous MCU movies. It gives its characters deep, lived in backstories full of individuality and personality and I absolutely loved it. It held my attention throughout its entirety and provided a fresh, utterly unique entering into the MCU giving us a taste of what may be to come. I only hope that they don't lose faith in Zhao and her work here due to the mixed critical reception."
2454,4,Boring Most boring marvel movie i ever seen fights effects cgi was 10/10 for me but the plot was ass cheeks. They just put together some a list actors and did nothing. Next movie might give us some really good insight on the story but this movie just felt half assed. Don't waste your money and if you really wanna watch it just pirate it.
2455,5,"Boring DC ripoff I really wanted to like this movie as a Marvel fan. Beside the beautiful shots and special effects the movie is boring. It does not happen really much. I was waiting for the villain to arrive, and there was nothing. The second part of the movie is just a mess, a lot of information, no real villain.And... it feels like a Justice League and the Boys (without the blood) ripoff. It fells like we see a Superman movie without Superman, and there is also The Flash in it.A waste of good talent. Unfortunately a lot of good actors do not have much to do.Just skip this one."
2456,8,"An awesome movie Idk why people are judging this movie so hard, is an awesome movie with powerful characters. Is not the best of marvel but is not the worst. So im giving an 8 of 10."
2457,9,Surprisingly enjoyable Based off of critics reviews I was worried but once I watched it I enjoyed the overall movie. I love the observations it made on humanity and didn't hit you over the head with it. I feel if there were to be a sequel it could delve in more such ideas with more depth. I love marvel and indeed this wasn't your typical marvel movie but I feel I like the risk they took with this in being not too overly stuffed sometimes with action and lots of things happening at once. It was nice to take a different approach where it took a more emotional approach to a superhero movie using their family dynamic to tie it in. Overall it was great but I did see a disconnect from the marvel universe and wished maybe the powers of some characters would have been more imaginative such as Thena's or Cersei's.
2458,6,"Okay to watch!!! Doesn't lift up to the expectations ,but graphic and editing hands off as you can expect from Marvel movies. Two post credit scene to wait for at last ."
2459,8,"Cast, Characters, Director, Cinematography AWESOME Going into this film, I knew it had to tackle a lot of the bigger ideas of MCU Lore (Celestials, Eternals ofc, origins of their universe ext) and given the levity of ALL characters involved, I think Chloe did a very great job.Overall: A great Marvel film and it should be appreciated and not hated, it doesn't deserve the negativity, it's awesome."
2460,1,"Disappointed I was very excited about this movie, specially because of the trailer and the cast.I must say, that this one was one of the worst movies i've seen in years.The script, acting, jokes, the whole story was aweful.It could've been a great movie, but they messed it up.So sad."
2461,9,Not as long as I thought Honestly really liked it not my fav mcu movie but it was fun the diversity didn't feel forced and felt natural I thought it was great fun movie. Well worth a watch Robb stark is super hot and so is Jon snow so if that's not reason enough I don't know what is .
2462,8,"Doesn't deserve the hate After hearing reviews about this film., I'd decided that this might be the marvel film to break the running streak for me since dark world.Glad to say I was wrong.Firstly this doesn't feel like a marvel film, atleast not untill the post credit scenes (which are worth staying for), but that isn't a bad thing it feels different because it is.Yes the plot is long but the film needed to get a lot of information in, this is definitely a film that will benefit from disney plus at somepoint because their could be many spinoffs set at different time periods giving you time with some of the more underused characters.The cast was great I had no reference or idea who thease characters were so I was pleasantly surprised about how quickly I found that I cared for them. Because its a large cast people will have their favourites ( Theana, Sersi, and Phastos for me) but I'm so interested to see more of the others.Visuals - just stunning...nothing else needed to sayDoes this have a great mcu villain....no....did it need one, not at all.Because this film is about far more than good vs bad.If you missed that then you missed most of the point of the filmWas it the best mcu film no but it definitely in my opinion stands up there with the rest, head held high."
2463,2,"So much build up, so little payoff. I could write a long review about everything I didn't like with this movie, but instead, I'll just say the reviews are true. This was a big nothing of a movie. If you asked me what my favorite scene was, I really don't know what I'd tell you. Two and a half hour snooze fest."
2464,3,"Doesn't feel loke Mervel Movie Visuals are good. I really appreciate the diverse casting. But the movie writing lags behind. The movie feels too much unnecessarily stretched. It could have been made considerably shorter. They tried to make character development, but failed. Except for some characters. Also the absence of main villain makes it's final climax less interesting."
2465,8,"It fits right into the MCU The main ""issue"" people seem to have with this film has very little to do with what's on screen and very much what is behind the scenes. I won't even be touching on those because there was nothing in it that felt out of place or made the movie not work.What does work is the visuals and the aesthetic. This does not look like a typical Marvel movie and that's all for the better. The fans have been saying that the stand alone films were becoming the same and too formulaic, so here we go. As far as structure goes it does not fit the same 3 act structure that many others follow. The character development is significantly more developed than many other films with far less characters.Overall, it works. There are some nitpicking things like comedic timing not as flush as some other films. And run time but Marvel doesn't treat it's fans like idiots. Sure they could cut the runtime by 10 minutes but none of the ""extra "" stuff felt boring or shoehorned in. And cutting for the sake of cutting isn't necessary this far into the MCU.So, the movie is good. Well shot. Well written. And the story and characters never felt out of place in the current universe. I can see these characters doing a lot more in upcoming projects. And exploring more of them and the possibilities of their powers sounds very good to me."
2466,5,"Could have been so good. So disappointed. This from someone that loves origin and backstories. Based on previews, this could have been epic. The movie was all over the place with backstories that seemed randomly inserted. Humor was good at times but did not help the overall movie which dragged. Casting was questionable and some characters were completely unconvincing. Not the usual Marvel emotional roller coaster due the lack of character development and inconsistent storytelling. Marvel knows their target audience. This movie was not it."
2467,1,"Awful. I'm sorry wow. From the horrible script to the bad acting for some of our ""greats"" smdh. And I'm so sorry not sorry but who on earth was/is Sprite and how did she get the role? Literally felt like she actually was a robot as her acting was just that. Robotic. What the heck happened. One of the worst movies I've ever seen."
2468,8,"Another Marvel Universe Very good movie. Another side of the MCU universe! Not so extremely full of action and mass battles! You can't compare it to the Avengers, you have to watch the film without Avenger expectations. Then he is also better than many think."
2469,3,"It has potential, but I don't think it was shown here. Starting off with the good, there's quite a few notable things to like about this film! The effects are gorgeous, there's quite a few moments that made me chuckle, the action scenes, as well as acting is good, and I LOVED the design on the celestials. I also appreciated the diverse cast that didn't seem too forced.So, with all that being said, as an asian girl who grew up on superheroes, I really wanted to like this. But I really couldn't. The first part of the movie starts with a text scroll, which, okay, a little bit of a drag to read, but it's a whole new cast of characters so the background's needed. But they do this multiple times through the whole movie where they stop for minute intervals to give us long, drawn out, uninteresting info-dumps.The two characters that were shown most, Cerci and Icarus were boring. They were supposed to be romantic interests, but god, I felt they had no chemistry other than ""hey, you're hot, I'm hot, wanna get together?"" I think this film would've hit emotionally harder if they were a better match, and we were able to mourn the loss of their relationship. Actually, I found the two other main couples in the movie really enjoyable, and I would've liked to see more of them, but they had little to no screen time.Individually, I felt the lead character was even worse. She was incredibly bland, which is a shame, because her mostly non combative themed powers are a cool concept. She had very little character development, and the final burst of power she DID have felt very deus ex machina.While I feel Icarus being a plot-twist antagonist was a good idea, I think it could've been played out better, and I wish we were shown some more of the viciousness his character had earlier in the movie.That being said, the movies obviously meant to have a sequel, and I hope for good things and more character development for the lead in it, because I do think the director is talented, and the characters do have potential, it just wasn't shown here. I wish them luck in the future."
2470,8,"Eternals 8/10 - while it's true that this film boasts a long runtime and does have a lot of characters (but certainly focuses on a few key ones), Chloé Zhao and her team did a fantastic job in bringing a nice breath of fresh air to the MCU with this mature, adult-driven superhero film that is the best of Disney's offerings since Avengers: Endgame."
2471,6,"what i expected The movie is exactly as i expected it to be, boring, lame protagonist with great visuals. The celestials having a larger role in the mcu was great, i don't like how they humanized the eternals so much(which is what they do with all their ""alien"" characters). The deviants were useless as shown in the trailers, i am excited to see what they do with harry's character in the future though. Wish they would of spoke on thanos more and their knowledge of him, Still confused as to where the tva , the multiverse and kang stand with all these powerful characters and how they measure up to beings like captain marvel, Asgardians , scarlet witch etc. Can't wait for silver surfer to pop up."
2472,8,"Surprisingly Good. I went in unsure if this would be for me, but came out after having enjoyed this offering from Marvel. I found the story interesting and the cast to be generally likeable, and the acting well executed. There was definitely some parallels between some of the Eternals and more prominent DC characters, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment. It's certainly vastly superior to the Shang Chi film on virtually every level. A worthy addition to the MCU. Please see it and make up your own mind whether it's for you."
2473,7,"Weak but Not Bad The storytelling and production values in ETERNALS are excellent, but this film remains a weak entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With admittedly difficult material, the cast does not always turn in convincing performances. Many characters have been changed from their comic book predecessors. Rather than feeling inspired and organic to the story, many of these changes feel like they were made to appeal to different markets. Some changes clearly were made out of political correctness, and some audiences likely will be offended by these changes."
2474,7,Another good MCU movie I enjoyed it albeit my least favorite of the three MCU films this year. It was a typical Marvel movie that greatly expanded the MCU and progressed the overall storyline with new characters. The brief sexuality in the PG-13 rating felt unnecessary to the overall story but look forward to see these characters in future MCU projects.
2475,6,"Wait for streaming Beautiful picture extremely boring. Just watch it in steaming. Too many characters not a lot of background, they do not have chemistry. My heart breaks I love Marvel and this is a weak picture."
2476,9,"Best MCU movie visually This is one of my top 5 marvel movies. The scale is amazingly grand, especially the ending. It does have its dull momements, yet it is very funny and interesting in the other moments. I'm excited with what this film intoduced to the MCU and can't wait for more."
2477,2,"So disappointing We went to this movie with such high hopes. I was beyond disappointed in it. The first hour is beyond boring. The characters in essence, are just characters special abilities stolen from other marvel and DC films with different actors. The film was confusing and all over the place. Not to say the main God looked like an inverted Lego that should have come from a power rangers movie."
2478,8,Underrated Everyone compares it t other mcu films and underrate it don't compare it to endgame and all it has storyline of its own and damn good. Unlike other mcu superheroes the eternals have comparatively logical character superpower.
2479,8,"Great Storyline,Great action sequences,almost no character development There was a vibe that was not found in any other mcu movie. This is not a mcu movie. It is a chloe zhao movie. Action sequences are perfect. Music combination Great. But all ten characters are not fair."
2480,9,"One of my new favorites I don't know where these bad reviews are coming from. This movie was amazing. Definitely more of a slower, more introspective take from the MCU, and very refreshing because of it. I didn't care for Black Widow so much, and while Shang Chi was a lot of fun, it didn't exactly blow me away and leave me bursting with confidence. I was worried for the future of Phase 4, but Eternals has made me really excited to see what comes next in the future of the MCU."
2481,10,"Great movie! Fun to watch! This was a great movie. The heroes were well written and the acting was great. I enjoyed everything. The length was also a nice touch, It was 2 hours and 30 minutes and it didnt feel too long.The fight scenes were awesome and plenty, as always for marvel movies. I would recommend anyone to watch it, as you didn't have to know a lot about other marvels movies, to enjoy this one.10/10."
2482,10,"Who will join the New Marvel Cinematic Universe? Yes, we need to keep an open mind, if you are to survive the new Phases of the MCU, and if Angelina Jolie is here, what is stopping Brad Pitt?When I watched ""The Eternals"", for the first time in a Marvel Movie, I could hear someone asleep and snoring. Although this really happened, I think it is a good Marvel Movie that helps to explain why Kevin Feige's MCU is so screwy.If you like how the recent MCU Movies have been 'rewritten' to depart from the Comic Books, partly to develop the characters and make the story more interesting, then you will enjoy ""The Eternals""If Brad Pitt does join the MCU, maybe the people who fall asleep watching this, will stay awake for him. ; )"
2483,10,"Great entry refreshing the Marvel franchise By Infinity War, the Marvel movies had been getting formulaic, and I felt done with them. Eternals changed that for me. It not only deepens and expands the world-building, it introduces new themes into the MCU. The first generation of Marvel movies emphasized the individual. This new general (Eternals, Shang Chi) emphasizes the connection to family and duty. A very different feel. I also like that this new generation of movie acknowledges the existence of a world beyond Europe/American, as one might expect for a series with putatively global scope. All in all, a great entry -- congrats Marvel, you've drawn me back in."
2484,10,"Loved it This is actually top-tier Marvel standards. The characters are great, story was great and a great amount of runtime. This is my favorite marvel movie and it is definitely worth watching."
2485,1,"A Useless Movie This movie try to explained everything from the beginning but ended up useless, Also too many characters with no development. The fight scene is boring, and the story is predictable, and the acting is mediocre."
2486,6,"Moving Imagery, but has SOME clunky, distracting flaws I liked the film a lot. The director really pushed the boundaries of what has been filmed in a Marvel film. Kudos to them on that, seriously.My main issues where mostly within issues in story logic and some questionable editing choices. I was pulled out of the story a few times because certain things within the story logic didn't make sense to me, especially with some of the choices the characters made. The editing didn't feel smooth at times, almost as if they were trying to cover up mistakes in filming or something ...It's a beautiful film with great visuals, but its flaws hurt my experience in enjoying the film."
2487,2,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in theaters I often get lost in the nitty gritty of philosophical thinking, as any healthy, growing, young thinker does. This is normal, we often delve deep into the question of what entertainment actually is. There are so so many variables in the regression of viewing a motion picture that determines the relationship that we all as humans use. For me, well, for me the grading of such things go usually unscathed. For example I had previously seen the first rendition of the suicide squad movie of the DC comics extended universe. Perhaps it was with my youth at the time of the release (17 in 2016), but I did not despise the movie. As so many well respected media sources lambasted the picture on the world wide web, I was sitting, entertained with the movie that was presented to me. But as I grew older, as my legs grew longer, I had come into my own in terms of what I should enjoy in a motion picture. I had crossed the threshold of looking past the attractive people on the screen, the beautiful choreographation of fight scenes, the awe-inspiring colors of lasers blasting people, and began to see movies for what they really are; Stories, movies are stories. And the story that was presented to me in this new rendition of a marvel movie was absolute abhorrence. There is not a single one of these new eternal characters that I thought was a good character. Actually I lied, I liked the flash's female counterpart who was deaf. The reason I liked her was because she never spoke to make me hate her like the rest of the characters. There were so many new characters in this movie that it was like the ""terrible and triumphant"" backstories of each character were fighting more than the actual characters.To kick things off I want to say that the major problems I have in this movie resides in many different aspects. For one the overcrowded plot attempting to piece backstories and things together in an incredibly inconsistent, and unappealing manner. The predictable nature of the plot that allows for convenience going foreword. The movie time jumps like crash bandicoot from one time period to another for no reason other than to add some advocation into the movie, because what is a movie without virtue signaling the next big thing to print votes.The movie loved to gas up the fact that Angelina Jolie was in this god forsaken movie, like they were really selling it that she was in the movie. Like if I were to buy a ticket to this movie, than angelina jolie would come thru the screen and tell me how to get a girlfriend. But the way I saw it, Angelina Jolie was in the movie for maybe 6 minutes, had like 3 lines, then died off screen. The most forgettable character by far. If these characters were even remotely Interesting I would have bothered learning their names, but instead I have to refer to them by how I remember them. Big nose annoying boy who stopped the Spanish Conquest of the Yucatan. Next up we have the moody lip injection of the group. This entire line of the story was forgettable, for instance, I forget what these characters even did. All I know is that her boyfriend with the sockem bopers on his hands ate it to give the squad that push to save the world or what ever.Next we should talk about the story. For the story to be believable, and for me to get behind it, people need to do things that make sense based on their personal motives, and people need to make decisions that make sense given the circumstances. This was violated probably hundreds of times in this movie. Like the little sprite character with orange hair wanted to kill humanity because it loved the superman rip off as well as wanted to be human but was also aligning with the side that was aiming to destroy humanity. Next we have the deviant that became sentient's only goal was to eat intelligent life, he fights the eternals with his boys the entire movie, but in the end when the eternals want to save the world that would continue to give this clown purpose, he choses to align with the side of the laser eyes guy. This makes no sense unless the deviants goal was to just oppose the majority of the eternals like a modern day contrarian. He was also spitting out a bunch of wanna be deep quotes from his CGI mouth but they were all forgettable, I couldn't name a single word that thing had said.To wrap things up this clunky movie felt like was just kind of slapped together with too much information, as well as too much plot armor and convenience that just didn't work for me. To send things off I am going to legally plagerize the report of the weeks famous quote ""My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined."""
2488,8,"It's a setup movie for future marvel movies This movie redefines the marvel universe. People probably hate it because it doesn't have a lot of jokes like Thor or Iron Man. Because this is a movie about the origin of the marvel universe, and let me tell you, at some points, it gets boring. There are several references of different mythologies throughout human history.This movie introduces new ideas to the marvel universe that most people won't be okay with because they want to see an action movie.Eternals is a backstory about this universe where the avengers aren't really these big heroes as they thing they are.We are getting deeper into the Marvel canon, and some of these things weren't popular in the first place.This movie will make more sense as the other movies come along. Its good. It isn't great, but it's good."
2489,10,"WE HAVE FINALLY ENTERED INTO A LEVEL ABOVE THANOS 🎥💫 WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!!!If Marvel Are Producing Beautiful Pieces like this Movie, then we are in for a real treat in the next 10 years.Firstly I Just Want to say, That the fight between Ikaris and a Deviant in The Amazon Jungle is the greatest fight I have ever seen in an MCU Movie. Ikaris Was Trying to Use his Laser Eyes as the Deviant Held him Down. IT FELT REAL, IT WAS SO INTENSE!!!Everything in this Movies Lore is of a Great Scale. Eternal Beings, God Level Intellect, A Creator God such as Arishem. I mean we are moving onto another level now.The Story is so Immersive, going back and forth in History. And We can See that with the Grand appearance of Arishem onto the Silver Screen, that Finally Galactus is going to enter in onto the Silver Screen.Phastos and the Hiroshima Scene coupled with Arishem Appearing on screen makes you really realise how Monumental the Scale of this Movie is.It Has Probably the Best Fight Scenes I've Ever Seen in an MCU Movie.Watch This on IMAX guys. The Audience I saw this with had a Blast with this one.It's Beautiful, it's beautiful to watch. 💖"
2490,8,"Strong storytelling, stunning visuals, and exceptional acting slightly encumbered by poor location choices, overuse of effects, and inconsistent pacing Eternals (2021) is certainly one of the more obscure Marvel comics with content that is both highly artistic and aesthetically appealing, and yet it contains a broad-scope narrative that is difficult to present cinematically, largely due to the vast history and individuality of each of the characters.Directed by Academy Award-winning director Chloe Zhao, the film follows the saga of the Eternals, an immortal race of beings sent to the Earth thousands of years ago to protect humans from an apex predator race known as Deviants. The ensemble cast includes Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikarus, Academy Award-winner Angelina Jolie as Thena, Salma Hayek as Ajak, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Lia McHugh as Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, Lauren Ridloff of ""The Walking Dead"" fame as Makkari, Barry Keoghan as Druig, and Ma Dong-seok (not to be confused with Benedict Wong from Doctor Strange (2016)) as Gilgamesh. The diversity and accolades of this all-star cast certainly sets Zhao with immense star power to work with.With so many important themes to touch on, from loss of love, betrayal, the good and the bad of technological advancement, and the destructive nature of humanity, it is no wonder the characters get lost in the shuffle. Some are more developed than others, such as Thena (Angelina Jolie), who suffers from a neurological condition resulting from the pain of all she has endured through the centuries. Jolie plays with this arc methodically, generating more emotion and connection than the rest of her counterparts. While a lot of time is spent focusing on the connection that Icarus and Sersi developed over the ages, ultimately falling in love, there is just no chemistry between the two. Each Eternal in their own way forges connections to humanity, relating to them in an unexpected way. The execution of the themes throughout time across various cultures and man-made disasters shines a light on humanity's failures in the hope that we may learn from them and not repeat them. Many of these sequences were poignant and tear-jerking that organically generates self-reflection without the audience feeling preached to.The flashback sequences that have the Eternals present throughout various important falls in civilization in history are fascinating in and of themselves, and had Marvel's strict timeline allowed for it, would have made an interesting enough prequel/origin story film in their own right. From Mesopatamia in 7000 BC to ancient Babylon in 1500 AD to Teotihuacan to the Gupta empire in 400 AD to the fall of the Aztecs in 1521 AD, these glimpses into fascinating historical times offers intrigue and social commentary on the folly of man. However, these iconic visuals perhaps set the modern-day sequences up to be decidedly more lackluster. The action of the fight sequences with the Deviants balances this out for the most part, however the pacing suffers from longer dramatic sequences in between.Despite the perhaps overzealous runtime of over two and a half hours, the characters still somehow feel underdeveloped. Icarus and Sersi lack any discernible heat or passion. Juxtaposed with such iconic on-screen romances that pulled heartstrings from the moment they met each other. Examples of this include Rick and Evie from Stephen Sommers' 1999 The Mummy, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman (1990) and Runaway Bride (1999), Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly in Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Each leading actor does well to portray their respective character's personalities, beliefs, strengths and weaknesses, however there's still a latent undertone of something lacking-an inability to truly be invested in them, individually or collectively, with the exception of Thena-a testament to Angelina's particular set of skills.And then there's the elephant in the room... Critics and audiences alike have praised or detested the incorporation of Marvel's first established on-screen openly gay couple, citing a variety of political correctness and the like. In all honesty, it neither detracts nor enhances the story only insofar as to give Phastos more reason to be invested in the fate of humanity. It was tastefully and naturally done-no reason to get in an uproar about it.Ramin Djawadi's score had no presence nor voracity, to the point that it was almost undetectable. Not to mention the first end-credits song is incredibly mismatched tonally. The amazing visual effects offered the Deviants truly predatory movement that made them both menacing and intriguing, and yet on the heels of Denis Villeneuve's Dune (2021), the visual landscapes suffered from the lack of filming on-location in nearly half of the sequences. For example, neither the 'Australia' nor the 'Amazon' sequences were shot in those respective locales, and in consideration of Marvel's generous $165 million Blockbuster budget, this just seems inexcusable.With all that being said, the film is most certainly not the dull dud most critics and reviewers are making it out to be. The themes are equally strong and dark, Zhao clearly unafraid to stand up on her soapbox and make a statement, asking audiences to reflect upon our own existence and an examination of what is truly important. The acting talent is exceptional, with Angelina turning in the strongest performance, generating some intense emotions. And as usual, the marketing team did the production a disservice incorporating most of the funny moments in the final trailer. It sets the audience up for disappointment when they go in expecting a different tone, not to mention considering this chronologically follows Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), which can easily be classified as a comedy in its own right. There are some lingering questions that follow the big reveal, but for the sake of not spoiling the third act, we'll skip those for now.FINAL VERDICT: While Eternals excels at storytelling, stunning visuals, and superior direction and acting, it remains too underdeveloped and sporadically paced to justify its runtime. Despite this, it is still thoroughly entertaining and does not feel as though it is nearly three hours. Definitely worth an IMAX viewing if you will go in with an open mind. And I shouldn't have to say this 26-films in, but STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS.And one last thing... For those of you who complained that Marvel films are too formulaic (just not true), and then complained about this film not being like other Marvel films... Perhaps you should reevaluate whether you have the ability to form an objective opinion, or consider maybe you're just an obsessive contrarian who is looking for a reason to complain.7.5 (8) = 1.5,1,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,1 - Rewatch Value: 5 (of 10) ______ Reviewed November 5th, 2021 - 1ST viewing 11/05/21 in IMAX at AMC Marvel Studios - Rated PG-13 - Directed by: Chloe Zhao - Based On: Marvel Comics."
2491,10,Another Great Marvel Movie Ignore the haters. I went in with an open clear mind. I did not read anything about the Eternals. Great fun movie with new characters. Of course stay for the 2 after credits. Enjoy the ride I sure did.
2492,10,Great film Many characters but I still felt as though we got to see and learn a bit about each of them. Had me both crying and laughing. Visually stunning. So refreshing to see all the different ethnicities and accents. Had a great time and would definitely go see it again.
2493,10,"Not sure what movie everyone else saw But I was duly impressed with Eternals. We saw it at Imax and I highly recommend a huge screen. The visuals are stunning along with the musics score. It kept me in the film the whole time. I teared up like four times in the film but never a full cry. I love how they bounce back and forth in time to tell the story as if clips of memories when it's important to reference it in the film. I didn't see the twist in the movie at all despite watching some spoilers on YouTube. Well done. The celestials were just intimidating and not cheesy like I was expecting. I'm not one to notice diversity in movies all that much but I have to say I loved loved how much this cast represents the world alongside a story of us all as a people. It really hit home. The fight scenes were pretty good too. Because of the live background scenes, it really felt like you were just there. You get like it really happened. Anyway greatly recommend it and can't wait for a sequel."
2494,9,"So, basically one of the best movies of the MCU so far This movie is simply amazing. The visuals, the vfx, the costumes, the deviants, omg it's like DUNE but for superheroes.I've read every single eternals comics do its not really fair, but all the issues the people I spoke about the movie had, were misunderstandings or things they didn't connect to each other. And maybe thats the one issue this movie has... It not for marvel beginners, nor for MCU exclusive person's. It's so much more, the connections, the relationships, the powers, the rules that the eternals live by and are controlled by.. it's an amazing job by the most promising Director in the business! Thank God Feige for this movie! Can't wait for the next one."
2495,10,"Don't let the haters get you down 🌈 Super entertaining and intriguing. I was entranced from beginning to end. I loved the diversity of the cast and the inclusion of queer characters. My only critic is that there could have been more queer characters and storylines. Over all, a fantastic film. Left me wanting more and wanting to watch it again."
2496,9,"This is a PRETTY GOOD Movie! I like NEW and DIFFERENT I already watched the new Marvel Studios movie ETERNALS in IMAX, 2x...It was incredible!!!! Really Good! Something NEW and DIFFERENT which I like that Marvel Studios did. There's nothing wrong with taking risk and try something different out of the ordinary and that's what, Marvel Studios and Chloe the director of Eternals did for this film. It's different from the rest of the Marvel movies but that what makes it Great...They want it to be different! The last 25 marvel movies, they use the same formula so why not take that chance or give it a chance to do something we never seen in a Marvel movie before. Good performance from all the actors for their characters. Good actions and humor. Great characters development and moments. The story was not hard to understand. The visual of the movie looks stunning and breath-taking. GO WATCH IT!!!"
2497,1,It was like watching paint dry That was absolutely awful... You hope it will get better but it does not at all. Kumail and his sidekick Karan were the only good parts of the movie. The music was absolutely blah. There was zero synergy among the characters. The bouncing around scenes made no sense.Such a waste of a talented cast...
2498,8,"Very enjoyable The Marvel like Comedy is strong in this one, the characters came together nicely and the story was entertaining.Cant wait for a second film and to see how the MCU will bring all the new heroes together in this new phase."
2499,3,"I wanted to like this so much, I watched it twice. Im a huge Marvel fan and have seen every movie over and over. Unfortunately, I just could not get into this movie. Maybe they tried too hard to character build, or too hard to show diversity. Dont get me wrong, I love that they tried to include everyone from each race, as well as having someone who is deaf, and they even a gay character. All of that effort I could appreciate, though those efforts seemed to fall a little flat by making the main character a stronger super hero who is white, as well as the goddess of war who also is white. Still overall not my issue with this movie as it was a decent attempt to include us all.My issues are with how boring the movie was and how much they overdid and drug out the boring parts. Also, all the glowing magical stuff which never bothered me before, finally also went too far. This movie was like the old really bad DC movies that tried too hard and fell flat. It totally missed the Marvel magic recipe for me. I did have to give it another try by seeing it twice, as I did doze off a few times my first visit. Seeing it twice was every worse and even more hokey then it was when I slept through parts of it. I'm guessing Marvel will make up for it with the next one, as we should not need 2 hours of getting to know everyone next time.The CG of course was pretty good, a bit too much magic and glowing hocus pocus. But it was OK and did have some excitement to it. Still, they tried too hard, I think. I actually started to feel sorry for marvel.Although disappointed in this movie, I still cant put my finger on all the things in this movie that bothered me. Too many to list maybe? As even the jokes were not quite the same and did not always have the perfect timing as in previous marvel movies. I feel like if Marvel continues down this road, the magic and secret recipe it once had will fade away and it will be DC, who will then be on top."
2500,7,"At Least She's Finished It An immersive experience of 157 minutes fully demonstrates Marvel's willingness for innovation and allowance to an artist's unique directory. Winning Oscar's Best Directing with the movie Nomadland, Chole Zhao demonstrates her impeccable skills in substantial characterizations and the impact of a conflicting world upon each Eternals with their unparalleled purpose and perspective. Circe's kindness and her growth into a responsible leader; Ikaris's unsurmountable power and twisted values that pushed him into flames; Sprite's insecurity which nurtures her sarcasm; Thena's pride, ability, and contradicting bewilderment. With these vivacious characters, the movie's major themes are able to present flawlessly: loyalty versus love, reason of a modified being, and the essential question that are humans truly worth saving. However, the chaotic flashback to numerous historical scenes may seem epic, but it's quite repetitive and time-consuming for a superhero movie. In the end, I really hope other independent Marvel movies could be made by directors of various specialties to present us the width of university."
2501,9,"Different style to the more recent MCU movies, but not in a bad way I went to this movie with fairly low expectations, in that i had heard many negative things about the movies overall quality.I did not, and do not pay attention to people moaning that a characters sex, race or sexuality is not as it was in the comic books, get over it people.The balance of story and action in this movie was about as perfect as it gets. Keeps the movie rolling perfectly as it switches from story, current and history and mixing in the action well.Good performances, excellent writing, sincere acting.Was a little strange to see the 2 brothers from GoT both courting a girl named Cersi (ok spelling a little different, but pronounced the same).The MCU is still in very good hands."
2502,2,"Marvel has become an Eternal disappointment What was once a reasonable franchise had become little more that a visually appealing money grab. The storyline was sub par, the plot was poor, and the conclusion left much to be desired. This is not a film. If you like watching a cinematic vomit of prefabricated ideas watch this movie. If you want a story that goes to big in concept, and under delivers in satisfaction, watch this movie. If you want a decent film, or a film that feels like a comic book, watch Iron Man, or Justice League Snyder Cut."
2503,9,"Spectacular AMAZINGLY different, this movie is so beautiful in so many different aspect. Through out the history, the friendship of certain character and the cinematography. I watch twice just to make sure what I miss. But the movie is even good the second time, pack of action, romances, humor and sarcasm. The villain was vicious, the villain behind the villain is even more threatening. Congrats Chloé Zhou."
2504,8,"It was stunning! I'm definitely a marvel fan, but there were still a few moments I felt were off in the movie. However, overall it was a beautiful movie that made me care about each individual character and want to learn more about - something I've missed in some previous team-up marvel movies. The actions shots were wonderful & had the best speedster fight sequence without a doubt, & the story was constantly making you re-think the characters & their morals. It was definitely different from the classic Marvel, but that's what made it unique & interesting. Worth seeing in my books and easily a top ranking marvel film... not number 1 but far from their worst."
2505,1,"bad movie There's so much adult scene but they don't even cut it, also this movie had a weak story which is boring and make me fall asleep during the show, i don't recommend you guys to watch this movie."
2506,9,"It's a good movie, just more mature. If you don't like it? Guess what you are Just finished watching it with my wife and 2 teenage kids, we all enjoyed it except my wife who is a jolie fan and thought she could of had more screen time or dialog. Clearly biased.Look, my fav marvel movie is still Ironman 1, this is not a ""typical"" marvel movie, because frankly it shouldn't be. 25, 26 films in, we should grow up a bit and let it have an identity. I thought the tone and the character settings were almost perfect, these are the ppl that only had one agenda for thousands of yrs (or they thought), but each is unique and have their own characteristics and agendas, they don't belong and don't fit in, the inner struggles each faces for so freaking long are real. Movie and its build up suppose to be a slower paced, yet still has great action sequences and timely comedic reliefs. Nevertheless this is a drama, about OLDER superheros in the MCU, so it does have a mature feel to it, like a fine wine. Anyone wants raunchy, like a beer, wait for guardians 3. I throughly enjoyed Eternals, thought it was great, didn't even realized it was 2 and half hrs cuz the drama keeps you in. It's definitely a welcomed changed a pace for MCU and something different."
2507,8,"a truly unique mcu film What an amazing, morally complex movie. So different than normal mcu movies with a focus on dialogue and emotion rather than action, but when the action scenes do come they are unique and spectacular. Gemma Chan's Sersi and Lauren Ridloff's Makkari are the clear stars, but each cast member got their own chance to shine. Can't wait to see where these characters go next!"
2508,5,"disappointing I was supposed to watch on IMAX but there was some licensing issue so a theatre was thrown up to replace it. I didn't notice that it was 3D which horrible to watch, those first scenes were incredibly dark.Angelina Jolie was wasted on an terrible character, which bugs me no end.The characters who died, I just felt nothing for them because I barely knew them.Golden special effects from hand waving had little heft.Script was terrible. I never felt earth was in danger. Deviants were bland CGI.As a massive Marvel fanboy, I can't tell you how disappointed I am.I would really be surprised if they made another, I don't think I would see a sequel in the theatres."
2509,8,"Good story line Loved the story line, with throwbacks to ancient times and other ways of life. Also really liked to see a diverse cast. Only thing that could have been better are the special effects, but overall easy and fun to follow, excited for part 2."
2510,10,"Best Movie ever Eternals is Marvel's biggest swing in years. It's an attempt at a prestige-style film directed by Chloé Zhao, fresh off her Oscar win, at a size and scale that none of Marvel's previous films have tried. But despite its grand ambitions, the film gets lost in its ponderous ideas and caught in the constraining box of what an MCU film has to be."
2511,6,"It's... complicated I'll make it short, absolutely fantastic cinematography, some of the best I've seen, beautiful, amazing action, blends really well, liked the twist, also loved the global conflict, a rather unique idea that doesn't feel like a marvel ending. It's not that funny though, the acting is suspect at times, but I still enjoyed it."
2512,6,"Not for Marvel fans It's not your typical Marvel movie, that's for sure. Is it a good movie? Not really. It does have good moments, but the story is to weak and some character's have basically glorified cameo. It should have been made into a show or just concentrate on more important Eternals. Killing some of them of early in the movie doesn't help with getting know them better. There is now real villain and everything seems wasted. It's more of very long end credit scene or trailer before Eternals 2. This supposed to be the biggest movie of the year, but it probably end up as biggest disappointment."
2513,5,"Much Potential But Unfulfilled This movie has some great things going for it. The cast is amazingly talented and engaging. The special effects are among the best of any Marvel Movie. The movie fils, however, to fulfill its promise and is very disappointing. Unlike Dune, which is similar in length, this one feels 3 hours long. It is, in fact, about 1 hour too long. The storyline is interesting and some moral quandaries are posed, which heightens the viewing experience for some and may be beyond others. It just is not great as a Marvel movie, or as a movie. Maybe Marvel is too focused on quantity and not fixated enough on quality."
2514,8,"Really yall It was actually a pretty decent movie. Amazing visuals and acting!! I did expect it to run a little long considers there's 7000 years of backstory. From what I've read, all you must not watch very many non action movies. If your complaint is not enough comedy and action than maybe a bigger more complicated mcu isn't for you. Movie definitely reminds me of watchmen. If your ready for a more adult mcu film, than this is it."
2515,10,Loved Every Minute of it. I don't know why everyone is hating this movie. Maybe because it is not the usual Hulk Smash no brainer. It is a beautiful and entertaining movie full of Marvel Action. I loved every second of it as did my entire family.
2516,8,"Great storytelling but could have been better! Eternals had a slow build up but I liked it. I rather it be slow and they explain their story rather than it feel rushed and make you confuse. The bad is that it was hard to give focus to so much MCU history and so many characters as each of them have their own purpose and role compacted into one movie without losing the entire plot of the movie. The deaf character Makkari didn't really get a story at all while others did which was a shame since this was a historical first for the MCU. I felt like this was a missed opportunity they glanced over. They briefly linked some characters to be the influences of myths and legends, but I don't think it came across as well as they intended especially for people who do not know the myths or the stories, scenes they referenced. The Darwin jab, Ikaris, Athena, etc. I had to explain to my family about some of that. Visuals were great and to be expected. The good part they got right was the diversity that it told as well as a story of a dysfunctional species of superbeings and their relationship to human kind and to themselves. It was relatively relatable because they each had their own strengths and weaknesses which made you understand each of their actions. It also shined a light on how some species change over time and how the ""good"" guys aren't always good and how the ""bad"" guys aren't always bad. Without giving away spoilers, I like the link of how the eternals connect with humanity over thousands of years to end up trying to prevent the humans demise and their own. How they looped their plot in with everything with Infinity Wars/Endgame made sense to me as to why these events caused them to ""come out"" of hiding."
2517,1,"Worried Just come back from seeing eternalsThe problem I have with this is that all these characters that are in this film are all introduced with the feeling that the same kind of love for the guardians of the galaxy should be given to them. Guardians of the galaxy earnt the love it has via building the characters in such a way that the audience cannot help but care.The eternals however is sort of just thrust upon us with obvious questions to tick the box casting and characters. Which inevitably makes it hard to care. . The humour is as funny as a root canal .""Least we will have front row tickets to the end of the world""The action is sparse and Boring. Overlong and I was persevering with it to see the famed end credits only to see cgi so bad its straight out of polar express . Pip the troll looks wack. And eros ...well I think I'm done with marvel after endgame.I really hope that this is a stand alone film . And the kind of inter weaving movies in the infinity saga will not be used again."
2518,9,"A sore sight for the eye The visuals and the performance of this movie blew me away. Unbiased opinion, even though I'm a huge Marvel fan I was ready to be let down. But Chloe Zhao really outdid everything. They portrayed alien species meeting their makers, and even the galaxys makers.Eternals shows a bigger picture rather than just the mortal humans or aliens (like Gotg) perspective. Showing how big of an impact the eternals could have/had on the humans even though they were told not to interfere. At first I was like ""yeah, Fiege wants more to milk out of the Thanos story"", but they did show another side of the coin on why the eternals couldn't do anything even though they wanted to save the humans and in Sersei's case, her new loved one.The story and all characters was alot to process, I understand some might take that as tedious, but I cannot disagree more. It adds depth and a core for the characters to build on, unlike Venom and Carnage that have better reviews than Eternals (????), which had no build ups and jumps straight into a brawl of nothingness.Eternals have spectacular action, showing the immense power they posess. Stunning fight scenes with a bit of humor, but not any forced down our throats comedy that Disney have a profound idea of doing. I can't say more than wow. I was really satisfied with this movie."
2519,9,"Surprisingly dramatic plot for adults Finally, after the mess of End Game, a script a little more intelligent for adult people, interesting and good defined characters, more drama and fewer gags, sense of wonder.Very happy to have seen it. I hope in a intelligent and intricate development of the lore."
2520,10,"SPEECHLESS This movie is a such a game changer, from the visuals to the cast I can dare to say is one of the best movies from MCU, unpredictable y very well done! I highly appreciate all the representations and inclusivity Chloé Zhao chose for this AWESOME movie!! It's a long film but we're able to see how each character develops. The right amount of emotions and comedy!!"
2521,3,"Loose of time What loose of time and money this movie, more and more I am convinced this hero movie formula is over is always the same thing but in this case and Wonder Woman 1984 the movies are so bad that you are really sad to be in the theater to watch so bad thing."
2522,5,"Had my doubts and gotten what I expected I watched Eternals and I gotta say...it sucked 😂 now that just might mean that I have a lack of knowledge about the Eternals because I never read any of the comics about them. But the entire movie felt really slow, LOTS of reading! Oh boy...there was a LOT!! And also the acting performances were good but not great. And it was hard to connect with the characters. I'd give Eternals a 5.7 out of 10I think in my opinion, this film is definitely the weakest of the MCU.I get what they where trying to do by introducing us to new characters most people don't know, but the story direction was shaky.Visual effects where very good. HahaI would watch the movie because there was some good stuff in it. But for me it's more of a one time thing. And probably won't revisit it in the next 10 years or so."
2523,7,"good, but to long The movie was very good, but to long, it felt longer than it was because of all the talking and unnecessary background talk, they could have cut a lot out without ruining the movie, MCU is light years ahead of DC, mainly because DC has to much PC shoved in it, i hope MCU sticks with way they make the movies, action and adventure more than social PC. Just hope the next movie isn't as slow and more action."
2524,8,"Better than the critics & Rotten Tomatoes say If you're expecting Superhero crash bang wallop from the MCU, this isn't the film for you. Without the benefit that The Avengers had, by building the team with their own films first, a lot of world building is required in the first act. I'm guessing that's what Chloe Zhao means by having Zack Snyder as a blueprint. This is far better, both in its storytelling and cinematography than The Snyder cut of Justice League.Fans of comics and Jack Kirby in particular will enjoy it, MCU & superhero film fans will prefer Venom 2. The mythology of The Eternals deserved the time. The second movie should be more fun, given the post-credit scenes, maybe even an appearance in Guardians 3."
2525,7,"It's not a bad movie It feels so different to other marvel films, but it is still an enjoyable, interesting and exciting film. The style and cinematography suit the hero's which are the eternals. If you want big set cgi action pieces or self-referential quips you may be disappointed. But if you want a good movie which is also a marvel film, then you'll like this one."
2526,10,10/10 I was blown away by this! I honestly didn't have high expectations because of the mixed reviews but this film was beautiful and unlike any other marvel film. GO WATCH IT.
2527,6,"Cast was great, but storyline was missing something I loved the cast. I was concerned that the diversity would be the primary focus over the actual storyline and acting abilities, but the cast were really great! The storyline however lacked something and I can't quite put my finger on it. It just didn't quite have the same charm and excitement as other Marvel movies. Also seeing Harry Styles seemed a bit odd, but I guess he's an actor now and I'm sure he'll do great."
2528,6,"It's not bad. It's not good. It exists. Right off the bat, is this film the worst Marvel movie ever made? No. Is it one of the worst? Maybe.If we're talking Marvel films in general, Eternals is certainly better than Fan4stic or X-Men: Apocalypse. If we're talking MCU films, it's a bit better than Thor: The Dark World and Captain Marvel, but not as good as Iron Man 3.The characters are not bad in of themselves. In fact they're all pretty interesting. It's the specific ways they're used in the film that go from ok to terrible.The plot is a mess. It seems to work until you finish the film and realize how bad it was. Two villains is hard to pull off. They did not pull it off. Killing Gilgamesh and leaving Nanjiani out of the ending were missed opportunities. Making Ikaris the villain and not just developing Kro was a mistake. Ikaris flying into the sun was probably one of the most on the nose, ridiculous things I've ever seen. The jumping between time periods gets annoying and boring.The bad part is the difference from the comic. They should've stuck to the source material.It's beautiful. The film looks amazing.Great soundtrack.Good acting.Skip it and watch it on Disney+."
2529,9,"not that bad As a pretentious cinephile, it's fun and harmless. I'm not sure why Eternals has faced such backlash, but it's not as bad as critics (who I usually agree with) make it out to seem."
2530,6,"A gamble that doesn't pay off It probably deserved less but Marvel sentiment gave it some ratings premium.Marvel have gambled on subject matter, characters and director and though not an abject failure, none hit the spot.I came away thinking I had sat through another DC offering, though Gunn's suicide squad proved gambles can work if calculated.The film didn't seem to know what it wanted to be and it showed. Stand out performance was probably Angelina's character, though even hers was the best of a 'meh' bunch.Kit Harrington played his usual, just about to burst into tears character and is shaping up to be the most dud Black Knight imaginable."
2531,7,Good movie I just wish we could have learned a bit more about the individuals before the big fight. It seemed too quick for a 2&1/2 hour movie. It didn't seem like it would be able to coexist with any of the other storylines.
2532,7,"A Marvel film that doesn't always feel like one Oscar winning indie darling Chloé Zhao has had quite the directing career in the span of six years since her debut Songs My Brothers Taught Me first released in 2015, with the Chinese born filmmaker moving onto the critically acclaimed The Rider, the award sweeping Nomadland and now in one of the biggest career trajectory leaps I can recall in recent memory, the newest Marvel franchise starter Eternals.A comic book film that never really feels like a comic book film and one that doesn't pander too the typical Marvel formula that the company and its owners Disney have played too so successfully over the last decade, Eternals allows Zhao too bring her independent nuances to a narrative with a $200 million dollar plus budget, one that is full to the brim with ideas, characters and possibilities, that whilst not always adding up to a completely satisfactory whole, combine to ensure that Marvel's big risk can still be regarded as a success, flaws and all.A fairly well-known property amongst the Marvel comic community, Eternals isn't exactly a name brand entity in the wider film going landscape and Zhao has a lot of ground to cover across her two and half hour plus feature that at times struggles with the weight of various timelines, character movements and narrative devices, to ensure that audiences get up to speed with their Deviants, Celestials and all the ensemble of the Eternal gang but despite the film dragging through certain stretches of its running time and not always giving sufficient time to its cast (Angelina Jolie's troubled Thena and Lauren Ridloff's deaf Makkari springing to mind), Eternals is an often beautifully shot film and one that can be commended for trying to reach for the stars.As she's shown across her short but noteworthy career so far, Zhao is a great director of actors and knows how to explore her characters (often in Terrence Malick like visual storytelling) in ways that inspire thought provoking and heartfelt feelings, with rising star Gemma Chan doing well as the kindhearted Sersi, Richard Madden doing his best work outside of Game of Thrones as Ikaris and Barry Keoghan having a blast as the intriguing mind controller Druig, with all performers working well alongside Zhao to give Eternals something more than pretty visuals and big narrative moments, even if Harish Patel's scene-stealing chauffer Karun may be audiences real MVP.With so much going on and so many characters too juggle along the way, the film plays out in a way that isn't going to be as predictable and stereotypical of what Marvel has built in the years past, with those seeking endless barrages of action scenes and a big city destroying battle finale likely to be left feeling relatively empty by the way Eternals presses forward onto its endgame, changing up the pace in a neat way that while not placing Eternals up too be regarded as one of Marvel's finest moments, at least places it well and truly in the top-tier of their feature catalogue when it comes to offering up something slightly different and far more risky than what has come in the past.It nothing else, Eternals shows that Marvel are not content in allowing their tentpole pictures to become stale and worn out, a good thing for all at days end.Final Say -A big film that doesn't always manage to balance out its many moving parts and ideas, Eternals is nonetheless another entertaining piece of the Marvel puzzle that tries to give audiences something different from a brand that has become synonymous with comfort food blockbusters.3 1/2 Stark family reunions out of 5."
2533,10,"It's actually good! Give it a chance This movie was really good, I really enjoyed the storyline and thought the characters had great chemistry. I am excited for the next movie. It's a refreshing look and beautifully shot. I hope you give this movie a chance!"
2534,8,"Why are ppl mad?? Is it just a coincidence that the most diverse MCU film is also the lowest rated? Idk...I admit it is a little long, but is that a crime? This was a refreshing take on immortal characters, and frankly the MCU cannot keep telling the same three stories over and over. This was the first fourth wave MCU product that actually made me excited for what comes in the future. The twists actually surprised me. I do wish they'd break from the formal of inserting jokes in scenes that don't need them, but the cast really did feel like a family and every character's actions were understandable and justified. This film was good and certainly better than other products marvel has released. I truly don't get why ppl are so angry."
2535,8,"One of the best movies Marvel has ever made! This movie is so broad and open that its difficult for some of us to absorb all of the information thrown to us. Its full of various mythological and historical references that it shows how well thought out every aspect of this movie was. On the standpoint of a entertaining superhero movie, it might be a bit slow but the primary purpose of this movie was to show how big marvel actually is. This is the best turning point marvel will ever see and i am so glad they chose such amazing directors and start cast for it.Cinematography and VFX are splendid."
2536,2,"People rating this movie above a three explain everything wrong with our planet. This movie is garbage. Start to finish garbage.I think one thing above everything else explains how disgustingly bad this movie is. Somehow these ""eternals"" have been walking the earth since 5000 BC but a freaking iPhone eludes them. These eternals would have witnessed the entire evolution of our species but somehow missed the invention of cell phones.The entire movie is full of nonsense like this and yet somehow this steaming pile of garbage has an average user rating of 8."
2537,3,"boring The Eternals is a far too long movie and has a weird storytelling. The characters are lame, too much CGI maybe the artist weren't sure in which movie they are actually playing. For me it's the worst MCU movie so far, but there is potential, of course for next movies. It's not a boring movie, it's just like... there is not much actually."
2538,1,"Poor plot, poor acting, bad film I'm sure Gemma Chan is a lovely woman but her acting is just bad. Its like her robot character in 'Humans' is a convenient role and that it's just her acting that's robotic. Every line she delivers is so monotonic and like she's reading from a script at a table read.Seriously poor plot. The celestials need to get energy from planets....so that they can create suns? *Slaps forehead* Even cool CGI can't carry this film. Film gets 4/10 from me because of some good humour from the Indian guys, and some cool historical references.Marvel won't care because of their revenues, but they're seriously churning out some average content now."
2539,4,"Beautifully shot. Terribly written. This movie is visually gorgeous and the effects are top notch. The writing and plot holes are what drags it way down... -2.5 hrs but still very little character development -Story jumps around too much, kills the flow and still doesn't comfortably tie anything together.-If Druig isn't supposed to use his mind control power on humanity, but also never once even tries to use it on Deviants or Eternals...WHEN has he ever used it in the entire time that they've been on worlds? And how do they decide he can put a Celestial to sleep based on zero eveidence?-Why didn't Cerci go find a mouse or other small animal to try her powers on? If the entire planet is on the line, maybe try and see if you can do whaevidence?There are so many more examples...this film just didn't work, at all."
2540,10,Great Movie It´s no the regular Marvel movie. Great actors in general. Great tweats plots. For me was not boring beside more that 2 hours. The actions sequences are very good.The flash backs are good and offer more explanation that maybe people looking for a pop corn movie will find tedious.
2541,7,"Karun took the show Effects were impresive, character and story development good but overall impression is so-so. Karun made this movie entertaining and without him movie would be even worse."
2542,4,"TI PIPA HTAN AYTH One of the worst Marvel movies ever made , nobody thought it would be possible to make something worst than green lantern. Movie was a lame love story with a bad main purpose.Please don't make a second one."
2543,4,"Peppa Pig is much better I fell asleep twice, and then proceeded to walk out of the cinema. I was constantly aware of the acting, felt like I was at a middle school play and I was scared someone would mess up and forget the lines. Similarly, the jokes felt like they were written by a teacher who was targeting a young audience but really didn't know what would be funny.The story was forgettable, so forgettable that it did actually draw me to a deep slumber on one occasion. The second snooze was due to the boring unrelatable characters. Their boring dialogue drifted me in out of sleep. To be honest, some of the best sleep i've had in a while so i've added one onto the rating for that.The title, ""Eternals"" is actually very fitting. This film didn't seem to end. Even after falling asleep twice and spending half an hour contemplating my whole life choices I still had an hour left.The best part of the film was that Harry Styles is in the end credits. Sadly I had actually left the cinema at that point in search of a non life wasting experience.Please don't waste your precious time on earth watching this film. Peppa pig is much better."
2544,10,"And that is how you introduce a bunch of new superheroes... DC The movie is beautiful not just visually but the story itself has so much meaning. This is not just here's a bunch of superheroes that you go see fight, the story truly takes you on a ride of unexpected turns that'll have you wanting more throughout the whole movie. DC take notes cause this is how you build up a team of superheroes, sure the movie might seem long to some but it is absolutely necessary to tell a good story."
2545,2,"Staggeringly dull kaleidoscope of nothingness If you like watching 2hrs of banal chit chat with the occasional burst of 1995 SFX then this is the film for you. Weak writing and careless direction are mostly to blame but there is something missing, it's like the director has never watched a scifi movie let alone anything in the Marvel franchise. Painful."
2546,8,"Solid MCU Outing Like no other MCU movie to date. This movie is all about forgiveness, equality, and choice. The movie is not predictable at all and really keeps the viewer guessing. I saw this movie with my fiancé and we couldn't stop talking about. Also, incredibly beautiful in regards to cinematography. This movie is a must see!"
2547,10,"Don't understand the bad reviews, I liked the movie a lot I am surprised to see the scores being so low after watching the movie. I really liked it. It took time to tell the story of every characters, and that makes the emotions so real at the end when you see they make different choices. It served the purpose of being an introduction movie of externals and the next phase of whatever to come for MCU. I don't want to ppl to miss this movie bc of the bad reviews."
2548,8,"Food for thought, epic visuals but the ending a bit off I personally like it:The movie raised very deep philosophical questions (that can be a little hard to swallow) that make me appreciate the vastness of the universe and the fragility, ugliness as well as beauty of humanity.The visuals are exceptional, seeing Arishem in IMAX 3D is a mind-blowing experience.Druig (this character scratched the itch I developed since I got to know Charles Xavier), Gilgamesh and ThenaThings I didn't enjoy:"
2549,9,"Everytime i watch a marvel movie i say this is the best one but this one is it This movie is worth watching i loved it! The acting, cinematography, content and all the universe that's been scripted is just more than perfect. I haven't had a second that im bored. After watching it i wanted to see some more content relating to this universe. I definitely wanna know more. Also after Shang-Chi, that's literally the best Marvel movie i've seen. I dont know why it has such low rating at first i didn't wanna see it because of its rating. But it definitely changed my view. Must watch!!"
2550,2,this is what happens when superhero movies Think they should win oscars.This would be rated even worse if it wasn't for the alphabet community voting this like it was a masterpiece.They tried to do too much at the same time and it ends up being a mess.
2551,9,"Who are the Eternals? The Marvel Cinematic Universe jumps head on into its next phase with Chloe Zhao's adaptation of the ETERNALS, based on characters created by Jack Kirby back in 1976, for what would be a 19 issue run of a series that initially was separate from the rest of the Marvel continuity at the time. Kirby's original series was strongly influence by Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, and the Arthur C. Clarke story it was based on in that worked off the theme of a highly advanced alien civilization coming to earth thousands of years in the past, and then guiding human evolution. In Kirby's book, the title characters are super powered beings who are given the responsibility of watching over development of humanity by the Celestials, a race of giant, omnipotent beings, who will one day return and judge if the human race is worthy of continuing their existence. These 10 Eternals appear to be humans, and live among them, but are forbidden to interfere with the course of human history, standing aside during wars, genocides, and every manner of catastrophe. Their opposites are the Deviants, mutated Eternals, physically ugly, and their sworn enemies, whom the Eternals protect humanity from. Over time, Kirby's characters were integrated into the Marvel continuity, with some members serving with The Avengers.Kirby had a great knack for writing epic space opera stories, as evidence by his work with Stan Lee on the early FANTASTIC FOUR series, and later with the NEW GODS over at DC Comics, a series filled with heroes and villains possessing God like powers. Jack Kirby was a genius in conveying the grandeur and the power of such sagas on the comic page, but film, on the other hand, has often in the past, proved not up to the task of translating stories filled with these incredibly powerful beings to the screen; as evidence I site what happened with Galactus (a creation of Kirby) in that FANTASTIC FOUR movie. On that matter, I do think the ETERNALS got it right, doing justice to the legacy of King Kirby, and giving us a film that is entertaining, though not without flaws, and one which pushes the MCU in a new direction, one that seems to draw back upon Marvel comics of the '70s, which any long time fan can tell you, was filled with a lot of craziness, and I don't mean that as criticism.At its heart, the ETERNALS, like the X-Men and The Avengers, is the story of a family, a group of siblings who must decide if they will bend to their parents' will, or decide what is right for themselves, and the humans they have come to care for so much. This family consists of: Selma Hayak as their leader Ajak, the only one capable of communicating with the Celestials; Ikaris, played by Richard Madden, who shoots laser beams from his eyes, and has the gift of flight; Sersi, played by Gemma Chan, who can transmute matter into any material she chooses; Kingo, played by Kumail Nanjaini, who can shoot deadly energy beams from his hands; Gilgamesh, played by Don Lee (who was everyone's favorite character in TRAIN TO BUSAN) who possesses super strength that rivals Thor and The Hulk; Sprite, played by Lia McHugh, a child who can create illusions; Druig, played by Barry Keoghan, who has the power of telepathy and mind control; Makkari; played by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff, who has super speed; Phastos, played by Brian Tyree Henry, a technological genius; and Thena, portrayed by Angelina Jolie, a warrior who uses energy to create weapons. Of this large group, it is former lovers Chan and Madden who get the most screen time, evening sharing the MCU's first PG-13 sex scene, but most to the others have their moments as well, and I think the film does a decent job of getting us invested with these characters. The story hues very close to the three act arc of most Marvel films: the first act establishes who is who among the Eternals with their arrival on Earth 7,000 years ago to save prehistoric humanity from the Deviants, we learn their powers, conflicts and tensions and what ultimately scattered them across the globe up to the present with the re-emergence of the Deviants post Thanos/Endgame; the second act concerns the reuniting of the team, where some members like Chan and Henry have assimilated themselves well among humans, while others, like Madden and Keoghan have kept their distance, in the face of the renewed threat from the Deviants, ending in a jungle confrontation and battle where there are casualties, and the hidden truth about the Celestials is revealed; setting the stage for the third act where the Eternals must square off against their creators for the sake to the planet and people they have come to love. The finale has betrayals and the requisite battle where everything is at stake and the heroes are pushed to the wall, seemingly with no chance of victory until...I found a lot to like in this movie, despite its flaws, which include an opening act very heavy with exposition and time jumps, as there is a lot to learn in a short time. The nominal villains, the Deviants, are introduced in the first half, and factor heavily in the story only to all but disappear as a threat in the second half when their leader is dispatched by Jolie; some characters don't get near enough screen time, like the very talented Ridloff. Some of the humor works, some of it doesn't; this is not GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. What really works is the casting, which is spot on, especially Jolie, Lee, and Keoghan; Chan is excellent in what amounts to the lead role, she might be my new favorite MCU heroine. Nanjaini really stands out as an immortal who has found a home as a Bollywood star. This might be the most gorgeous looking MCU film ever, as Zhao did a lot of location filming in places like the Canary Islands. The effects do their job, and the sequence where the Dreaming Celestial partially rises from the earth is proof that this film has truly captured Kirby original vision. At over two and a half hours, ETERNALS is long, but for me, it went by fast. Marvel and Disney clearly took a risk by making a film built around what to many fans are definitely obscure heroes, but they pulled it off, and making it clear that the MCU is not afraid to move into uncharted territory going forward, that it doesn't need Steve Rogers and Tony Stark to make compelling movies.And speaking of the future, there are a couple of end credits scenes that raise the stakes nicely: welcome to the MCU Harry Styles and Kit Harrington."
2552,9,"A great addition to the MCU canon Great acting, great visual effects, a strong sense of heart, emotional. It felt like an MCU film and yet very different. My only drawback was the length, though I don't feel there were many scenes that were unnecessary or didn't keep the plot moving forward. I'm excited to see how this film shapes the future of the MCU!"
2553,8,"Not nearly as bad as the critics say I enjoyed the movie. I went in with low expectations cuz of all the lower reviews/memes. And I think that's why I enjoyed it. We still need to remember that it's a marvel movie. Russo brothers, great crew, and an all star of a cast. It's still a good movie, just not nearly as good as Endgame, infinity war, Ragnarok, etc. The design and special effects were A+. The story and buildup was a little slow/confusing at times tho. Especially, the flashbacks, but besides that, good movie with some great action."
2554,7,"In Xanadu 2021 If Xanadu and Marvel had a baby, it would be the Eternals. Fantasy, inspiration, Gods & Celestials, End of the World, Save all of Humanity.Except no Roller skates, but it does have a Bollywood Musical Number. I wish it had had Roller skates."
2555,4,"Meh!! Really wanted to like this, but felt like a DC movie, rushed and script was all over the place, plot holes everywere, i just didnt care about these new hero's.... meh!!"
2556,6,"IS THIS A ""MARVEL STUDIOUS"" FILM????! Eternals (2021) absolutely failed in presenting and introducing this beautiful story and characters/superheroes of Eternals in a way that would be entertaining and enjoyable to not just the MCU fans but to everyone. There is not one person to blame because the film is bad in nearly every aspect. Like, the editing, the music score, and surprisingly the acting which is shocking when you look at the cast and big names that the film has.There are many other ways to introduce and tell the story of the film that are not used well and the film doesn't take advantage of the beautiful story that Eternals have, because Eternals with its many characters/superheroes and the cast chosen to portray these superheroes have a unique and entraining story that can entrain anyone and everyone. So, why ruin such a beautiful story like that? Why not take advantage of these sources and apply them well to the film to present an entertaining film?.There is no way the script and dialogues are written by an academy award winner. They are very ""cringe"", cheap, and cheezy. The film is full of long, unorganized, unnecessary, and meaningful pusses and silences. The opening scene Is very bad and no film would want to start off the way Eternals does.The story and plot of Eternals (2021) is told in a way that would cause confusion and chaos to audience members and to the film itself by jumping right back and forth in time and it does that many times and in a way that would make you wonder what year and where are we now in the story/plot?.The acting is (surprisingly) very bad. An actor/actress should always deliver a realistic performance in which the audience doesn't feel like they are watching someone who is ""acting"". Every performance that I have seen in this film made me feel like I was watching someone who is trying to put on some fake facial expressions to play the role of their character. When a character was trying to deliver or provoke a specific emotion/feeling in the heart of audience members, they failed, because of the bad acting and portrayal. It's very shocking because there are names like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harrington, and Richard Madden. There is only one actor who shocked me with their performance and acting that seemed more than real. They portrayed their character more than well and were able to deliver to the audience what and who this character really is and that actor is Barry Keoghan as Druig. Druig is such a mean, tough, (sometimes) cocky character that likes to make and follow his own roles. Barry Keoghan was able to play that role very well. You can see it in his facial expressions, voice tone, and body language. I don't know how the film would've been without him.I have spotted many editing mistakes that are very noticeable. For instance, in a scene where an earthquake is happening, you can tell that not every prop in the set design is moving/falling down, some were still. How can a prob be holding still and not moving at all when there is a strong earthquake that was caused because of the arrival of creates in the size of a truck?. How is that even possible or realistic?Or In one scene when a character is holding something in their hands, in the next shot, it is not there anymore.In addition, the transitions between scenes are the worst that I have seen in any film before. They are so cheap and weirdly made in a way that seems like there Is zero effort put into it. For instance, if a character is walking to enter a building, the scene transitions and does a jump cut into the character being inside the building like some kind of magic occurred. The jump cuts/transitions are also being done in such cheap and very bad way.The music is very usual. Nothing new is presented. This is weird because I thought ""Eternals"" would have their own/signature theme music the same way Iron Man or Spiderman has one. In which when you hear it you'll be able to reignite it as the theme music of ""Eternals"". Or maybe there is one but I haven't heard it. But, even if there is and the fact that is it not noticeable, means that the music department failed.The runtime is 2h 35m. This movie should've been at least 1h 50m. It's way more than enough and can easily be told in that runtime as the story is pretty simple and straightforward. In addition, the film has way too many scenes that literally mean and add nothing. It also has way too much comedy in it and in a way that would make you feel like you are watching a superhero/""comedy"" film instead of a serious superhero film. Marvel films always use comedy in every film, But it is being used way too much in Eternals (2021).My rating is: 6.5/10 Watched: in theatre."
2557,1,"A generic movie with a shallow character development and Except the for the movie visuals and the divert cast, this film is the victim of the Marvel formula, with bad timed jokes and forced flashbacks. Unfortunately, Chloe Zhao's direction didn't do any good to make a decent movie."
2558,2,"This movie kinda sucked, here's why... This is why I thought this movie sucked, here's what happened.Last night, I went with my dad to watch this movie and I was excited as always, as usual, we went in, got our snacks and drinks and we started watching, 15 minutes in and my dad fell asleep and as the movie went on, I could feel my eyelids getting heavier and heavier and I was getting bored out of my mind. I felt like I was in there for years, I loved the visuals and the 2 Indian guys were awesome too but the comedy in this movie was really dry, it had a stupidly long runtime and overall, I think this was the most boring marvel movie I've ever seen, probably the worst too.But, it's just my opinion, everyone has their own thoughts and I respect you all for them."
2559,4,"I picked up my phone. I started looking at my phone during the movie. That never happens, I'm disappointed it was depressing. I was waiting for Sersi to say something, do something throughout the whole movie. There was no dialogue, and the lack of dialogue didn't provide mystery only anxiety. I won't watch it agin or recommend."
2560,9,"Amazing movie I love this movie and think it's my favorite MCU movie so far. The story was great and didn't feel generic or rushed. Great characters. It was more serious than other marvel movies which I liked, but it also had some good humor. It felt like they actually faced a threat that the had to overcome. The visuals/settings were amazing."
2561,1,"Words can't describe how bad this is... I took my son and Nephew to watch this movie based on the trailer we caught during the last Marvel film. Words cannot describe how bad this film is, if I was on my own I would have walked out after 30 minsZero plot just loads of talking about pretty much nothing, some bizarre weird ending. The whole thing was a painful experience."
2562,8,"The MCU just got a whole lot bigger !! Quite a different MCU film here, going straight into an ensemble team rather than a slow build up like we had with avengers but this film delivers. The infinity saga is over and people need to come to terms with that. Can't wait to see more of the Eternals !!"
2563,5,this film is not needed and should of not happened This film itself is really boring shang chi and black widow did way better keeping up good action explaining all the characters and their background but this one is slow and fast at the same times and the ending is just disappointing.
2564,8,"A generally good film Before watching the movie I had some concerns having read all of the reviews. Is it long? It isn't though at all exhausting in my opinion. It is as long as it needs to be in order to explain what is happening. The eternals are a new part of the marvel universe, in movies at least, and therefore it needs those two and a half hours to make you understand what the eternals actually are.In addition, what was also really good about the movie is the visual effects being marvel but also the fight scenes( not as good as Shang Chi though) and the acting which has a significant role ,as far as i am concerned, in maintaining the audience' s attention throughout all of the movie. Furthermore, the comedy in the movie helps humanise the characters and makes them more relatable.I hope more films like this will come from marvel in the future to expand the MCU."
2565,10,A different direction but definitely entertaining DON'T let the critic reviews put you off. I personally think this is definitely one of the top marvel movies. I went into it thinking the plot would be mediocre with just 'eternals vs deviants' as the focus but they threw in some plot twists I really enjoyed. The humor was also great and my whole theatre was laughing a lot- the movie definitely filled any gaps with humor.I respect it if others didn't fully enjoy the movie but it is in NO WAY one of the worst marvel movies as the critics and reviews stated earlier. I would put it in the top 25-30% of marvel movies definitely.Go watch it and form your own opinion. Don't be too influenced by the critics.
2566,6,"It was...okay. As much as I like the MCU, they're beginning to feel a bit flat for me and this movie proves it. It feels like a different type of movie that isn't Marvel which makes it interesting. But since this is a Marvel movie, they used old tropes and clichés we've seen dozens of times in the MCU which gets annoying. Visually, the movie looks good and the style is magnificent. What I do enjoy is that it is getting ready for something big in future movies, but the movie as a whole was slow and sometimes some parts that were questioning for interested becomes something not all that exciting."
2567,10,"No ifs, no buts... I have read some of the reviews, and many of the comments online; so I will kick this off by saying that if you are offended by a 1 second kiss between 2 men in the middle of a superb era spanning superhero epic, then this is not the film for you.If however you would like a spectacular, emotional, and action-packed film that evenly mixes everything that makes a great film: loss, love, action, humour, emotions, internal struggles, and cosmic lore, then this is the one for you to watch.It's a solid 8 or 9 out of 10, I have bumped it up to a 10 to counter the absolutely ridiculous low rating aimed at the same sex relationship. I have watched all the Marvel movies, both in cinema and out, and this stands up there with the best of them because it has heart whilst not taking itself too seriously (you can get some pretty solid nods to DC, Dragon Ball and a few other universes). Seasoned actors stand side by side with new talent and everyone gets their spot in the light. A special shout out to Lauren Ridloff (Makkari) and Don Lee (Gilgamesh) who stole the show through their characters, acting and great relationships with other actors/characters. How Ridloff can do more with a glance or look than others can with a whole page of dialogue shows off her talent.The only downside is that the film leaves you with a lot of questions, but that is because it is kicking off a brand new era for the MCU so is leaving a lot open. Honestly, I have no idea how they are going to bring together cosmic beings with mult-dimensionsonal rifts, but I am in for the ride.Watch it, enjoy it, and imagine what comes next."
2568,9,Look beyond LGBTQ.. Desi tadka.. This is one of the best storytelling movie in supehero genre.. Each heros got all the screen time its not like just beacuse your superman can do all at the end.. If phastos can do what he did to ikaris. I believe Iron man can defeat thor/sup (Given proper motivation).. Movie awesome it had all the elements.. Desi tadka.
2569,8,"Eternals is Enjoyable Well. When the bad reviews came, i did believe those as from trailers it was looking lackluster due to obvious reasons that it was new superhero team movie and we were not introduced with these characters before.But with such bad / average reviews, i went to watch with low expectations, but it turned out a very good and entertaining movie.The Cast is amazing, direction is very good, action is perfect, visuals, cinematography is stunning and beautiful.Just villian is not that good though there are pretty much good action sequences with deviants.The color tone is the USP of the movie, which is very different from any other Marvel movie.Overall i really enjoyed it watching it in IMAX and would recommend everyone to give it a try."
2570,1,"What a mess A bad rip off of a Marvel movie. Horrible writing, directing and acting. Nip this in the bud and write it off as a dream sequence from an actual MCU movie."
2571,10,"Watch it and decide for yourself! I actively recommend people to ignore critic reviews because they are likely doing it for a profit which means that their opinion will most likely be biased, same goes for audience reviews in a way that their reviews are biased because of their personal preferences and taste. (not mentioning the very obvious LGBTQ+ hate spread)There is a lot to juggle in this movie but for the most part, everything was handled brilliantly and was not as polluted as many say it is but that could also simply come down to how much you know about the MCU. The movie is eternity above others in the MCU compared to how emotional it is, it has many deep, spiritual ideas and views about it which require people to be open-minded. The humor is also amazing but doesn't elude the common problem of Marvel movies of misplacing humor and jokes or packing it in where it's not needed. Finally the action and cinematography is astounding and breath-taking, the visuals of this movie cannot be compared to any other Marvel one because they are simply on another level, whether it is a awe-inspiring sunset shot or an exhilarating action sequence, everything was done beautifully. The powers of everyone were shown on screen in full-scale and every single Eternal had their own moment to shine.So watch and decide for yourself how much you like this movie! It's not bad by any means and I would say it's absolutely amazing but that could also be because I went into the movie with substantial MCU knowledge which is way above average compared to the casual watcher who are also the ones who seem to be bombarding the movie with horrible reviews. My comprehension of the ideas of the MCU could also be why I was so amazed by every little thing that happened in the movie which of course had led me to writing this 10* review."
2572,7,"I enjoyed it! Enough, I suppose. There were characters in this movie that I really liked individually! Especially Phastos (who knocked it out of the park with the humor, along with Kingo). So good acting for the most part, except for Angelina Jolie, who is not good at being sad and at crying. Plus, Richard Madden looks very similar to Sebastian Stan/Bucky, and they could've easily casted someone else to play his role.The action sequences were pretty cool to look at too, some good grand fun! And the ending was a real shocker with the main villain, just wait and see!The main issue with the film though is that it's so jumbled for someone who doesn't follow the comic books closely enough. I found myself getting confused and not fully comprehending the mythology, leaving me with many questions and making it so that I was loosely following the film, instead of being on the same page with it. Some of the character motivations and relationships didn't make much sense as well, and I feel like earlier MCU films are easier to follow since most are already familiar with the characters and their origin stories are simpler to understand. I didn't care for the deviants one bit either. Overall, not bad, but definitely not my favorite Marvel film or one I'd watch again. It was meh, and I expect greatness from most of not all Marvel films. Maybe I shouldn't anymore."
2573,7,"Not Marvel's best work, but definitely undeserving of the hate Ignore the critics and review bombs, Eternals is not bad at all.This movie has so much to offer and enjoy in its 2.5 hour run time. I will add that I went into this movie not knowing much about who the eternals are and where exactly they fit into Marvel's giant universe.Let's start with the positives. Visually, it's one of the best looking films in the MCU with stunning action sequences. The characters are quite compelling for the most part and each of them bring a different flavour to the overall story. I'm very interested to see what the future holds for each of them as the film does enough to peak further interest. The acting is very very good. The challenge with these films that introduce multiple characters in one go, is that often things can feel clustered especially if the acting sucks. However, Marvel yet again has done a great job with the casting choices for each of these characters. In typical MCU fashion, the film also contained a few comedic moments which were well timed and didn't feel forced in any way.On the down side, the film suffered a bit with its overall story. Eternals deliberately tries to be an emotional story that emphasizes the uniqueness of humankind and why its worth saving. While the message is clear enough in the film, the problem is that its just difficult to truly feel the impact of the emotional moments with a new batch of characters and in the space of just 150 minutes. I feel like Eternals would've been better off initially as a Marvel series, giving viewers time to learn more about their place in the MCU and to better connect with each of the characters. That being said, I still think the director did a pretty solid job in putting together a film with so many diverse characters without it feeling overcrowded. If anything, I have more questions now then ever before which is not a bad thing going into this new Phase of the MCU."
2574,4,As boring as it is long It was a chore to sit through. Lacked the joy and humor of Thor Ragnarok. I think it tried to have the gravity of End Game but had so much information to dump. Felt like homework.
2575,6,"Worried for the future... Oh dear,oh dear...Terribly cast film. God knows why great actors like Hayek,Joliet & Lee are even here. Some good bits but a poor film and very,very poor script. I wonder how this really fits in and impacts future McIntyre films. As for Madden and Harrington. Genuinely terrible performances and poor,wooden characters. I was worried over this before I even saw the film...Such lazy filmmaking in my opinion. So many other options,with such an open back catalogue, to reference if MCU want to change direction or set up future projects.Had so much potential and promise but I've genuinely not been as let down since Thor 2 (might actually be better)"
2576,8,"Please give this a shot The movie, in my opinion, was not a slow, unemotional mess. The characters are incredibly fun to watch and their relationships/conflict are what carry the movie. There was only one moment in the film that I felt dragged on a few minutes longer than it needed to, but it immediately picked up again after that. It was diverse, but not in a preachy, political way. The differences in the characters were empowering and actually aided their characters identities. I think this movie is so contested because it doesn't it the marvel formula as well as other movies (so it is jarring to the marvel fans who crave movies like Ant-Man) and it is a blockbuster superhero movie so it deters the art/critic group. If you put labels aside, this is visually beautiful movie about 7,000 year old superheroes confronting the possibility of death. If that sounds appealing to you, I encourage you to ignore what others are saying and see it for yourself. I would like more experimentation like this in big blockbusters in the future. I think this one boils down to a matter of preference. I gave it an 8 because personally, watching it brought me great joy, I loved the characters and themes, and I felt it was above average. I'm curious to see how time will treat this one. I imagine it will be like many of Jack Kirby's post-60's works: maybe a little too high-concept and hard to digest at the time, but worth a go to see the artists vision. It's not perfect, but I thought it was a good time."
2577,8,"Thought it suck and it Didn't Huge Marvel fan, didn't know to much about Eternal's, but read some old comics before movie.Now I have read all the bad and I only agree with one, but it didn't bother me. That's the length of the movie. I didn't really mind this.I heard it was boring, I was never bored.I heard it was bad story, well it's not for everyone it was cool to me.The Characters were good and I really liked some of the new marvel heroes.Yes there are some people that want to make political statements with a movie, but I really don't care about that.If you like Marvel movies try it, go in with your own views and hopefully you'll like it like I did.I would watch again.1. Shang Chi 2. Free Guy 3. Eternals 4. Black WidowIs my rating for the year."
2578,5,"Disappointed To begin with I believe it is important to clear one thing: I am a marvel big fan.As always, the movie is very well done so you won't be dissapointed with the special effects, etc.Perhaps because of the introduction of so many characters at once was what made it fail for me. I didn't like every character and even those I did connect with it was in an almost supperficial way.The storyline is completely different from other marvel films. Another set of beings. The good guys might be bad. This part could be refreshing but I didn't feel it.Please someone tell actors to stop freezing their faces (won't mention wich). It is bad for the movies and probably for themselves. We have seen extraterrestial characters more expressive than some actors that go down this road.I hope movies that will follow will make up for this one, wich felt like a very long introduction. I missed the LOLs all other marvel films give us, mixed with drama and adventure.All in all, I'd say this movie failed in the above mentioned features I'd expect to encounter."
2579,8,Enjoyed it Wasnt the best marvel movie that was the first avengers movie for me. But this was a good orgin story for the eternals and had the end credits sort of debut 4 new marvel characters.
2580,10,"Amazing as expected,don't worry about negative reviews ! Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was epic, great story, capturing throughout, and emotionally engaging.Most of the negative reviews were done even before movie released due to hatred against LGBTQ.Movie was close enough to what has been shown in comics and in future we'll have overwhelming content from marvel."
2581,9,"It is beautiful. Anyone who has been following the comics and the storyline closely, they know how deep this movie went. It links everything from Endgame to Blade. Ahh. Love it.It was an amazing and a well thought storyline. Individual characters can get more background but generally, they all fit in. Pacing is nice.Visuals! God. So beautiful."
2582,10,"MCU's latest entry is a visual spectacle crafted for the Marvel fans. DISCLAIMER: Homophobes need to stay away Chloe Zhao has delivered what might just be one of the most nuanced films in the MCU after Black Panther. From a diverse cast to brilliant direction, Eternals is a film that casual moviegoers can enjoy without needing to catch up on the previous films in this cinematic universe. For the Marvel fans its a visual spectacle with a well written storyline and that quintessential humor. The film packs a punch in terms of action and emotions. The film makes you feel the same kind of dilemma that the Eternals are faced with: Should humanity be allowed to exist or use it to make way for other forms of life? We get to see the conflict within the team when their ideologies create a friction and it eventually climaxes into the final act with some stunning cinematography.It might be easy for the audience to not give this film a go based on the ratings and the thrashing its receiving from the critics but watch the film with an open mind and then form your own opinions. Eternals is the first superhero film to portray a deaf superhero character played by a deaf actress and actors with varied racial backgrounds portraying the Godly beings. The film also beautifully portrays a gay relationship in a way that it doesn't feel forced. So, after watching the film one may wonder whether the film critics were on weed while writing the reviews for this film!"
2583,4,"Great characters, weak story Eternals was the latest film in the mcu, it has come good qualities, like everyone of the characters, they all get a chance to shine, they all have their own strengths, personalities, flaws, and inner vulnerability's, each of them added to the story and there wasn't a single one of them I didn't think were poorly written, it also have some impressive shots and cgi, and it is more than you're standard marvel movie, all that said, I found the story to be a bit weak, they tell us one thing about their mission and show us the opposite, also the plot changed throughout its second act, which was ok, I just wish we could have known sooner. And I found the main plot a bit stupid, and I feel like the film would have been better without the deviant's, and I found myself board throughout certain points in the movie, and I dealt like the flashbacks were far to long, if a sequel dose get made by the same director and maybe some different writers, as the director seems to know what she's doing in terms of the characters, but not the plot, and it did get me exited to see them again, all in all this brings out the worst and best of movies, I hope I didn't upset anyone with this review, and have a good day."
2584,5,"Better than the ""Venom"" sequel. But, not as riveting as ""Black Widow."" I remember buying ETERNALS volume 1/number 1 when the Jack Kirby comic first came out. And I considered it revolutionary. A Marvel Earth where the superheros and super-villains were based on ancient astronaut theory!I was, therefore, sad when the series was cancelled. Although, I was heavily consoled when the dangling plot threads were resolved by THOR v. 1/#300.As for Neil Gaiman's ""Celestial Seed' story arc? That I found considerably less-than-impressive. So, Marvel Films adapting that element into the screenplay of this movie was just as disappointing. Especially with the total revision of the original premise, re: Ikaris being the heroic protagonist and Druig being the traitor!Add all that to the fact that there was one part, early on, that I literally slept through and you have a next-phase Marvel flick that might be useful in introducing the Black Knight to modern cinematic continuity. But, that's the only thing positive I can say about this film."
2585,10,"this is amazing Didn't expect it to be so awesome.Story is different and unpredictable, cast is awesome, visuals are awesome, action is great, comedy is also good.All in all great movie."
2586,8,"Love the new direction I went into Eternals with slightly lower expectations after seeing the negative reaction from critics - after seeing it I really don't understand the hate. The cinematography is fantastic, I loved the story, and it sets up a huge future for the MCU. Definitely better to have sporadic comedy rather than zany one-liners every 2 minutes. And THAT shot of Arishem the Judge towards the end...excellent!"
2587,5,"First MCU movie i did not like Didn't expect it to be good before I went to see it, wanted to see it because it could bring ua a hint about the future. It wasn't good but not bad either. Just hints that there may be a second movie and whould defenetly not see this again or the next one."
2588,7,"Much like the comic, it doesn't really fit in the MCU. Overall I enjoyed this film.It doesn't have the fun factor of Guardians of the Galaxy nor does it benefit from the years of build up that led us to Avengers.Instead this is a cosmic family drama played out against a very high stakes background.IThe first half of the film tries to blend exposition, world building and character intros . It doesn't rush this (which is good) but after the initial action sequence it is a bit flat.There is humour, though it is fitful and feels a little forced at times. The actors are all good, but some of the dialogue feels a little stilted and the love affair between Richard Madden's Ikaris and Gemma Chan's Sersi lacks sparkle. Her scenes with Kit Harrington have much more chemistry.The film is beautifully shot.Set design and aesthetics were excellent, with a stunning set piece outside the Ishtar gate in Babylon. (Btw go see that if you are ever in Berlin .it's in the same museum as the Pergamon).The second half ramps the stakes up properly and has more action, drama and threat as well as a satisfying denouement .I went in half expecting a mess like a DC Justice League but this is a better movie than that.The main weakness of the film is that it inhabits the MCU. There are only a couple of references to Thanos and the snap but they beg more questions than they answer.Unsurprisingly there will be a sequel and I'd go see that too.Btw there are two end credit scenes . Both worth waiting for .Overall though itcs not bad. I'd give it a 7/10."
2589,10,"The best Marvel movie!!! The visual effects are brilliant , everything looks so realistic and stylish! The cast is amazing! I really like the story and I think that from Marvel are trying to do something new and different and I think that this movie is that thing! I really enjoyed the beautiful landscapes and every second of this movie!!!"
2590,4,Fell asleep... Boring. My woman who's usually easily amused and likes every movie actually said she didn't like it either if that tells you anything. I thought it was a little boring and fell asleep in the beginning and in the middle.
2591,1,"Slow Very slow and poor story plot, my money wasted, time wasted, i was sleeping half the time, totally garbage movie. I would not suggest anyone to watch this movie and waste their time and money, this is not like other marvel movies which are action loaded and are very much interesting,"
2592,5,"👽 ETERNALLY LONG 👽 Look, I'm a marvel fan from way back. Whether you've read the comic book or not this was very slow paced. On the other hand the scenery and the costumes were well done. This movie was more of an introduction to the Eternals where you could meet the characters and understand what their mission in life was. Overall this is a movie that I would not go back and see again."
2593,5,"Loss for Words So...I did come out of the movie mixed. I don't completely love or hate the movie. For some positives, I did appreciate that the producers were willing to take a risk with this film as it greatly deviates from the standard formula for the MCU.I did like the expanded world-building to the lore with learning more about the Celestials. On a cinematographic level, the visuals; creature designs; and action sequences were good. So, a well-crafted movie.As much as I could admire their risks with changing the formula, they probably went too far. The film suffers considerably from exposition dumps making the pacing laborious to get through. Its 2-hour runtime further undermines it because there isn't much there to keep you invested.As a more ""serious "" take on an MCU film, there is not much in the way of humor and even when there is, it's too dry and conflicts with the tone.The introduction of the Eternals also presents issues. For instance, if they were around for thousands of years, then why did they do nothing to stop Thanos in IW? Sure, the film does try to say they couldn't get involved with affairs unless the deviants were in the equation. But...considering the fact that the Blip created the right circumstances for a Celestial to emerge, it feels counterproductive to just have the Mad Titan succeed since it would hinder the chances of the emergence from happening.The team themselves. None stood out as interesting and were underdeveloped. Sure, some had their own personalities and quirks, they mostly fell under the generic character types like: the Leader; the Smart Guy; the Muscle, etc.While the film does have moments where the characters have some ""hidden depths,"" at best they are just informed attributes. The issue more seems that they could not decide which Eternal to focus on due to there being too many. Not helping that some characters make complete 180s with little reason.But, ultimately, Eternals is a mixed bag. While not the absolute worst of the MCU films, it does seem that the writers were at a loss on how to convey the story.I just felt empty after watching it."
2594,6,"Sloooooow but ended up good In a nutshell; Great start, very slow buildup in the middle, but great last hour. This made the movie feel a bit long.Great effects and diversity of the actors/characters was good although I felt Angelina and Salma were not in their element. Hope the next one has a better pace."
2595,10,"Different, interesting and refreshing. It was a pleasant surprise to see a Marvel movie that transcends beyond the action scenes, showing everything a superhero story can lead to. The characters are very well developed and it is surprising that Makkari steals the action scenes. It is one of my favorite movies because of the immensity of its story, there is much to discover from this movie and for sure they will bring us more impressive things."
2596,9,"Matter of choices Next great story in the Marvel Universe. You will meet a group of Earth keepers, each one with a superpower. But it is the matter of choices which side is good and which side is bad and are all the Eternals together or not ... Fighting scenes with Deviants have solid action and all the movie was interesting to follow. Best role award goes to Gemma Chan."
2597,8,"Different MCU movie It is nice to see how different MCU movies can be. Visuals are amazing, one of the best I saw the past few years. Happy to see that ""The Blip"" is not being disposed, so the movie is watchable even if you haven't saw the past MCU movies.Story was stable and strong, but if you asked me it was a little bit too ""long"". Lots of new characters are being introduced, sometimes I need to think 'who was who'. Performance of the actors is good!Marvels' Eternals is an enjoyable movie with (most of the time) lots of references to other MCU movies. I think there is a bright future for the Eternals and I hope we will see more of these group!"
2598,5,"Visually appealing but lacking in pace and exposition. Visually, this movie looked great on imax, and I can't fault the cinematography generally. Perhaps it was a lot to present but a fair few moments I found myself checking my watch a fair few times to see how much longer I had to endure... this movie is saved by some pretty decent performances by the cast,My problem, too many characters, too little development. With so much going on, somehow not much happens. Do you actually invested in any single character if you're not a fanboy?This overall feels like a Marvel misfire but hopefully acts as enough set up for something better."
2599,6,"The Obvious Joke: Marvel Studios Presents The Mehternals Eternals has the unenviable task of not only helping reboot the Marvel universe but introducing an entirely new team of characters. Its tougher to do than you think and I would describe the execution as mixed. I did like most of the characters they offered up, they have mixed power sets and perspectives on the Celestials. Each of them are distinct and relatively fun to watch. It's one of the pleasures of a team movie, you get to ride along as they build comraderie and group chemistry. We get some time to spend with each of them and other than Athena and Gilgamesh's dynamic, none of it is particularly involving or compelling. It was a tall task and while Eternals didn't faceplant on developing the characters, it didn't stick the landing either.I was a little surprised about how big of a cast this project was able to put together. But Marvel has the money to write big cheques with many zeroes so that may have played a factor as well. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are the two actors with the most screen time and while they are both capable and charismatic performers, they're handcuffed by their characters. They're both a little wooden, I want to believe that they were directed to be that way to sell the unfeeling and godly nature of their characters but it made it more difficult to empathize with their struggle. I felt bad for Angelina Jolie, she showed up to work and she does a great job. Her character is also the most interesting on the team. But the movie has her alternate between fighting and freaking out and there's little room to show her range in between. Kumail Nanjiani provides the movie with some much needed levity but a lot of his material feels like retreads of Tony Stark's snarky one-liners and I just didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. I also want to credit Brian Tyree Henry (his scene in 1945 is easily the most emotionally impactful in the movie), Ma Dong-Seok and Lia McHugh for their work in their supporting parts. I thought Salma Hayek and Barry Keoghan were interesting casting choices and they both play well against type.If you're going to check this out on the big screen, you're going to want some big action set pieces. Eternals doesn't reinvent the wheel but I did like a lot of the fight scenes. The different powers the group possesses are utilized well and while the Deviants are pretty generic, I did like how they adapted to the Eternals and became more difficult to fight as the movie went on. So from that angle, Eternals scratches that itch.There are plenty of things to praise in Eternals but there are just as many weaknesses. They put too much on this movie, there's so much setup and between the odd editing for the flashbacks and jumping back and forth between locations and different periods of time, Eternals feels unfocused. It's also just too long, you feel the 2.5 hr runtime and with how slack the pacing can get, I was definitely shifting around in my seat and checking my phone.I feel bad for Chloe Zhao and the Eternals creative team. Eternals is a passable superhero flick, the action scenes are solid, the cast is game and the effects look good. Everything should add up to a success here. But the movie is bloated, too exposition heavy and despite a diverse cast of characters, you can't really bond with them over their struggle. It just feels too derivative for Marvel and while that's understandable considering their longevity and the weight of the expectations, it doesn't make Eternals any better. I saw this with a couple of friends and one of them compared it to Green Lantern. I think its better than that effort but its fairly good match. Skip Eternals in the theatre but if you're a ride or die Marvel fan, check it out on Disney Plus."
2600,1,"Movie's perfect to sleep. 😴😴 This movie is ""eternally"" boried, innecesary, simple, slow quality and very suck's.There's nothing to save here.Marvel suck's with that last movies.👎👎👎"
2601,10,"Cinematography of MCU is on another level First of all, ""Eternals movie is suck"" is the most idiotic thing I've heard in this year. I mean the movie is not perfect it's different, different from any other MCU movies. Movie's Cinematography,Visual Effect,Music...I've never seen that in MCU before. Also the movie has some smoothest,eye soothing action scenes,Those are compeletely new to MCU. But there are few moments I felt a little unbalanced about Action scenes & Emotional Scenes yet I think it bought some Dark vibe to the movie, I think character development of the movie was not perfect, also the ending was not much of a woowy. Overall I enjoyed the damn movie. Also it's different,I love that difference And there is no universe out there that this movie is gonna be worst than Thor2 & Captain Marvel."
2602,4,One time is enough My expectation is high due to the fragman but reality is dissappointing. One time is enough for it. It can have second film but not to be needed. Dune is perfect but externals is dull.
2603,10,"Great movie, I just think the MCU has run its course. This movie was excellent. I read the negative reviews and promptly ignored them like always. After the last Avengers movie, I noticed the interest for the MCU had noticeably declined. Don't put down a movie just because it's the cool thing to do. Externals isn't the best but it's a fantastic movie. It came with the typical Marvel cheesy humor that's in every movie/show so everyone saying the dialogue is bad, every MCU is cheesy af. Stop being sheep, go watch the movie, decide for yourself and don't be another passenger on the hater bandwagon."
2604,6,"Respect, but mixed. Lots to digest. Very dense indeed and very much a mixed bag.VFX is top notch the Celestials are cool. The Deviants were a big issue in the film. The film had a ""OH LOOK A MONSTER! LETS KILL IT!"" kind of approach to it. When it's revealed that they got some motive, it's very abrupt and executed without too much thought. I can somewhat forgive this as the film has to juggle ten characters, so I did expect the villains to be an afterthought, but they could have been more.The cast is pretty good, director Chloe Zhao and the writers do a good job balancing the entire cast. Not one of them felt left out, and to their best abilities try to develop them properly. Here are my stand-outs:Don Lee (Ma Dong-seok) as Gilgamesh gets a shoutout as the first Korean superhero on screen. Yes, this is because I'm Korean. Also I liked the banter he had with Angelina Jolie's Thena. It was the only relationship between the team where I felt it came off a bit more genuine than most.Richard Madden as Ikaris does a good job playing it straight without it feeling boring. The entire time he's on screen, you get the sense that something is on his mind and it makes you wonder what he's thinking.Lia McHugh as Sprite also impressed me as she is basically an Eternal who physically looks young, but Lia as a young actor does a great job portraying Sprite as if she is a bitter old soul.Barry Koeghan as Druig also impressed me. The film also plays with the idea if he's either on the side of good or bad.I respect the MCU's bold move to swing big. I can see what their approach to this film was. It reminded me of Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS, but instead of the perspective of the humans, we get it in the perspective of the engineers(or in this case, the Eternals).I'm going to sound somewhat hypocritical, as I do appreciate that they tried to be different and made big swings with a lot of high concepts and some thought provoking ideals, but at the end of the day it all felt pretentious and overly sentimental with some syrupy moments throughout.Lots of exposition too. ALSO, the plot felt very similar, if not almost identical to GOTG VOL. 2. It kinda felt as if they were disregarding what happened, but let me remind you that Ego the living planet in VOL. 2 played by Kurt Russell is a Celestial and Star-Lord inherited some of those gifts, which explains why he held on to an infinity stone and didn't die.In conclusion, I found myself thinking throughout the film ""wow they're going in this direction, this is cool and I love and respect these choices"" but it is ultimately weighted down by its structural flaws, bland villains, some twists you can see coming a mile away, and its overly sentimental tone.6/10."
2605,4,"Not Marvel Great cinematography, but this movie struggles beneath its own weight. 10 main characters means non of them get enough screen time. They each seem to lack any real personality and so feel almost like androids.A sex scene in a Marvel movie? A big no. This is about superheroes and is for the whole family, kids included.This would have been better with just three or four plot characters with individual personalities that could develop over the course of the film.I couldn't finish it, it was boring."
2606,3,"It was a movie, that's for sure. I'm going to steer away from spoilers in this review. I saw Eternals on opening night, and as much as the cinematic scenes and beautifully choreographed fight sequences caught my attention; sometimes it was monotonous. Long boring cinematic shots took most of the movie's screen time. Marvel incorporating mixed ethnicities for their characters, which was awesome to see and each character did what they were written too, but each character also felt stock. Very few of the eternals actually had some sort of change to their change and overall each of them felt round and cliché. The storyline was what can be expected from a Marvel movie, it was nothing special. The plot was rough and choppy and every event that was supposed to progress the movie on felt blunt and forced, as if the director spent too much time filming the sunset and quickly wrote in moving plot points; it felt like a shopping list.As a Marvel fan, I'd say go and see it. I'm sure that it will captivate fans during the film, but it won't wow most of them."
2607,8,"The most different of all MCU Visually Eternals is great, like few action scenes, I am not going to say that it is the best film of the UCM, but it is not the worst either, it is true that at times the script does not favor and several scenes could well have been cut, on the controversies unleashed, there is no forced inclusion in my opinion, everything develops naturally and they do not emphasize anything to you, they simply introduce you to the characters who they are and nothing else. I would have liked to see more than some characters but I thought the movie was good, not amazing or wonderful, just good, to hang out and enjoy a good story and good special and visual effects, yes, if you still do not see the movie stay until the end, that the two post-credit scenes are wonderful. And personally I do recommend it. (English is not my first language, so I apologize for any spelling or grammatical errors)"
2608,3,"Worst Marvel film so far !!! If I was watching it on my own at the cinema I would have left half way though!!The acting was awful the script was terrible, I like how marvel put a bit of comedy in to films, but not one joke was funny. Well the film itself was a joke. It just felt like the whole film was done in a studio around green screen, which isn't a good sign.The effects were poor, the ending after nearly 3 hours was a let down. I could go on But I'm not wasting anymore time on this film. One of the only Marvel films I would never watch again 👎👎👎"
2609,6,"A Out of the Box MCU Movie ETERNALS, Marvel Cinemas again with a super fictional movie released on November 4th 2021...Verdict : Super Hit 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐Plot of the Movie : Arishem, who could say the creator of the universe rather being portrayed as the God Type image had created ETERNALS to fight against the Deviants ( the evil) & these eternals are immortal having supernatural powers came to earth 7000 years ago protecting the earth in every century against the deviants.....Analysis of the Movie :1) If we go with the expectations of the usual marvel movie it will be a great disappointment, as the story moves slowly & we feel boredom as there is no action, or any twists and turns which we usually observe in Marvel Movies....2) A different concept of immortality, creation of the eternals by programming etc etc makes the users amazed for the thinking skills of the Hollywood.....3) Hollywood stories, its approach towards technology, science is being showcased in various forms which always makes us applaud...4) Making a fictional movie convincing is really notable....5) Here also, by giving the end credits it raised the expectations of the audience.....Now lets witness the magic of upcoming Marvel Movies."
2610,3,"Excellent movie but lacks the Marvel vibe From visuals to audio to vfx , everything is amazing but still made me disappointed. It never felt like I'm watching a Marvel movie. There are too many characters in this movie which were included without proper introduction."
2611,8,"Refreshingly different Eternals has a few problems, it's biggest being a pointless villain, but it's so refreshingly different to the rest of the MCU that it's still a great movie with stunning visuals, impressive emotional heft and humour that rarely undercuts the emotional weight.Gemma Chan gives an incredible lead performance and Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani and Ma Dong-seok are all also incredible. Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff and Barry Keoghan are all great, if a little underutilized.Chloé Zhao's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and definitely one of the most visually stunning films in the MCU. The CG is mostly impressive but has quite a few weak moments. The music by Ramin Djawadi is really good."
2612,9,"One of the few marvel movies I could relate to I actually loved the movie. Despite what others are saying on the pacing, I thought it felt pretty good and didn't rush through character development or general storytelling.I also could relate to many of the characters. I liked the family themes likes conflict, self doubt, leading without forcing someone to do something, mental health/abuse. And I truly appreciate how the film talks about human existence and focuses on a message of hope, love, and the value of everyone's talents, not just strength but also intellect.Overall a great film that will be entertaining for the masses but also emotionally touching for some."
2613,10,"REPRESENTATION MATTERS This film is made for everyone, not matter who you are you can see yourself in the film and the characters are always showing up their emotions. I think my favorite was Angelina Jolie."
2614,8,"I have so much to talk about So lets start with the critic reviews. I didnt felt any connection with any of the main character else of Kit Harington. The acting was awful else of Kit Harington. That was all the critic reviews, now lets talk about the good reviews. CGI was overwhelmingly nice and VFX was so good to. I loved how the director always used actual sunlight, it makes the movie much more alive. I loved the jokes since it was a marvel movie to. The story was good and it was actually pretty better then Black Widow. The length was perfect. But i did not liked the fact that they made deviants like animals. They was acting on their instincts. The post credits was so good, it was such a nice marvel movie. I don't think its a 6.9 its like 7.5. I can say you need to watch this on theaters."
2615,7,Why the hate? This is a solid MCU movie! I don't get all the negative reviews. I went into this with low expectations because of what I'd read from critics but I was pleasantly surprised. The cast did a great job and I found each of the characters to be very likeable especially Kumail Nanjiaji who I thought was the best part of the movie.Go into this one with an open mind and you won't be disappointed it's a solid Marvel movie!
2616,5,"Don't spoil the brand I have to give it star just bcz of the cast .So many things are there to be talked or discussed .Background music The movie travells to much and it's all of no use Fight scenes are too boring Something is wrong or they just have lost there focus in corona .Power which is given to the characters are been not used at allPositive pointsCast is good , but they don't look fresh enough for the movies .Karan Patel gives some relief that he is thereGill the only good character is no moreJolly the angelina is also used as a cheer leader she doesn't have any good way for the movie .A big no for a big cast movie to be combine in a small movie."
2617,7,"Best MCU movie of the year Eternals has one of the best opening scenes in a marvel movie that is eye candy for an Eternals fan. Visuals are impressive particularly with the powers and how they look. The non linear storytelling will work for some but not for other (it worked for me personally).The celestials looked amazing and the film has a large scale. The two post credit scenes are great for the future of different parts of the movie and the ending makes me want Eternals 2 as fast as possible.Where the film lets me down is with the twist with Ikaris. As an Eternals fan I think it was a poor interpretation of this character and killing him off was not how I saw Ikaris when imagining him from the comics. However possible sequels may allow for this problem to be abolished. Sprite becoming human made sense due to the actor ageing but the character not so I was perfectly fine with this.Overall the film is almost perfection, just one fatal flaw allowed for the film to slowly lose me."
2618,5,Worst MCU movie ever! It was supper draggy. Bad characterisation for every character. Movie went really boring. Disappointed:( Music was average. I didn't like the direction at all. The whole movie was super hard to adapt maybe it's because the new faces.
2619,10,"One Of The BEST MCU Movie!! One Of The BEST MCU Movies to watch, it was so refreshing to see a new way of film making within the MC universe, every character was amazingly designed and described, loved the diversity and inclusion part of it, each character and their emotions were well displayed, the performances were good, the cinematography and direction was so refreshing and amazing, VFX was spectacular, smooth and very crisp, every action scene with the deviants was very well executed, loved the movie start till the end!Everyone should watch it and experience it as a fresh take in the superhero universe and not judge or compare it to the level or aspects of any other Marvel movie, I applaud the makers of ""Eternals"" for making this movie the way it is!It is so good to see the uniqueness and the newness of it.Aaaaaammazing!!Bravo!! Superb!!"
2620,1,"Pointless The visuals and characters were great but the story and everything else felt pointless and dumb . Bad writing on few characters especially Kingo, Kingo leaving was unnecessary- wasted potential. And Ikaris character was the worst especially the last bit where he tried to kill Sersi cause couldnt because he loved her? So you are telling me He Killed 2 characters for nothing?.And the Prime deviant character had so much potential to be the endgame villain but wasted it. Disappointed.But love the remaining characters- Sersi,Kingo,Gilgamesh(another wasted character), phastos,Druig and Makkari(queen) were great. The Actions were amazing."
2621,10,Masterpiece movie Something different from regular marvel movies I really liked it 🙂.... Must watch ... And support this type of art. And get ready for galactus and starfox (Harry styles ) which look amazing and.
2622,10,"Absolutely Magical!!! 10/10 💫 As a Comic book nerd, I had to see it for myself after all the negative reviews! ETERNALS is a visual masterpiece and one of the first superhero movies with a SOUL! ChloèZhao is a master storyteller blending emotions that are palpable as each unique immortal characters story unfolds.This is true passion for HUMANITY!If you're a MARVEL fan, you're in for the most amazing surprise!!!Not the typical Marvel formula but it works as this was refreshing! A package with humour, action, emotions, diversity and equality unlike any Marvel movie!Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden give their finest most sincere performances.A MUST WATCH! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
2623,5,"Mad Weary and Concerned for more Eternals Eternals will make you Mad Weary ... & concerned for their future involvement in the MCU. Sadly, this did not do justice to these characters nor the MCU. It has its highlights but they are few. 50% of the cast is wholly unnecessary beyond their power set making them unrelatable. (Ajak & Sprite's acting is 100% terrible) I was so hopeful for this project but somehow going more grand makes this film feel small & claustrophobic. Here for hoping they come back with a Thor like overhaul in the next outing."
2624,8,"Amazing and enjoyable to watch I dont knowwhat the critics on rotten tomatoes are saying but this movie is a part of the better of the mcu films, maybe top 10 or 15 in my opinion. The movie didnt feel like it was 2 hours and a half."
2625,10,One of the best Marvel films. I think the critics are wrong on this. Went in having low expectations and it ended up being my second favorite movie this year after Dune. It certainly a movie that deserves a second viewing as unlike other marvel films it doesn't spell everything out for you. You need to think about the characters motivations a bit but that process only adds to why I enjoyed this film.
2626,8,"Critics are going too far After what critics were saying thought id only enjoy the movie in 3D. After seeing it it's a solid movie w/o the 3D and a brilliant, ENTERTAINING movie. Best phase 4 movie so far as I honetly didn't enjoy black widow and shang-chi that much so I'm not a marvel fanboy. But they nailed this one. Solid 8!"
2627,7,"Not Marvels best, but certainly not the worst. I heard so many bad reviews about this movie, but didn't watch any of them cause I was worried I be influenced by them, so I decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. I was eager to see a new installment in the marvel universe.What works are the effects, really jump out at you, and never feel over used, and some humorous moments are pretty funny. But what doesn't work is most of the characters don't really click to the point you feel they have a history with each other.. Some of the acting here is very dry, Angelina Jolie gets a mixed bag, some moments in the film she looks bored and sleepwalking, and other moments she's really giving her all. But I am eager to see where the story goes after this."
2628,10,Trend set even before its release Some are just following the trend set even before the release of the movie that the movie is not good i just want them to wait for its box office numbers Then your mouths will be shut Now on review; i actually enjoyed the movie even more than shangchi and black widow It is a different environment by marvel and we should appreciate it.
2629,1,"What's the point ??? Full disclosure- this is the first MCU movie I have seen , the story is so contrived - made up superheroes to fight some monsters for nothingI guess this will be last MCU movieAlso please stop listing super heroes movies as Sci-Fi . They are at best mythological."
2630,10,Spectacular movie.. A hardcore marvel fan finds this movie satisfying. Gives answer to so many questions arising after end game.. Every character is unique and all did their part excellently. I liked the addition of emotion of empathy to characters.. As usual Visuals are extra ordinary. Hatts off to writer who Within confined time covered complete story. Side plots in movie gives it required flavour of story.. Totally stunning and enjoyable movie for every movement..
2631,4,"Making a deep story occasionally makes a flop The strength of this movie plays into the star-studded cast. There are no complaints on my end from acting in any sense. I believe Jolie, whom was under-utilized, did a great job with what role she had in this one, but you can't dress up a bad storyline.Everything in this plot was original Disney princess (Cinderella, Snow White) fluff with superheroes.Recurring themes appear. Two characters (Sersi & Ikaris) are exes who are in love for thousands upon thousands of years, and that love for each other saves the end battle scene, but Sersi also has a mortal lover who has a ""family secret"" (STAY UNTIL THE VERY END OF THE CREDITS).Next comes Gilgamesh and Thena (""drop the A"" as she says in the movie), Gilgamesh is a devoted lover to Thena. Thena has gone absolutely bonkers and assaults everyone and anyone, even her own lover. Gilgamesh and Thena live together when the group tries to reunite. Gilgamesh clearly doing what he can to love on Thena and Thena just being a screw loose and a dollar short of anything in this universe. There's probably some cheesy ""he loved her through everything"" bit here. It's horribly oversold. As would be a strong prediction, useless Thena gets her lover killed because she's still a screw loose and a dollar short of understanding why she's remembering.After Gilgamesh dies in combat, Thena then realizes where she left that loose screw and that extra dollar. She becomes one of the most impactful heroes of all time. I guess watching your lover get stabbed eleven or so times and his life force sucked out of him would make you want to get it together.Then you have the wicked ""stepsister"" in Sprite. Sprite is a kid who can never grow up. Neither could Pinocchio, but his story was far better and effectively told. A majority of Sprite's plot is dedicated to talking about how she wants to date Ikarus, but since she's always a youth, she can never be loved. After discovering Sprite is jealous for the twentieth time in the storyline, Sprite stabs Sersi in the near climax of battle because she is ""jealous"". If a theme like jealousy has to be stated by a character, the storyline didn't build it up enough.Of course, as any person would do, after being stabbed in the liver by Sprite, and finishing battle, Sersi decides she and her band of heroes can turn Sprite into a ""real human"". At the end of the film, Sprite is noted as being grumpy that she has to go to ""human school"" but oddly enough WANTED to be human ALL movie.The goal of this movie was to make a deep river of philosophical story telling, but man is it a puddle. It is the second longest movie to Avengers End Game and man, it should have been about thirty or forty minutes shorter.So why does this get four stars? First, it is not a Batman v. Superman fiasco. Second, there are light-hearted moments and the human character following the cast as the documentarian is incredibly delightful to the story and fills that void of human connection."
2632,9,"Nothing more than a spectacle!! So, Marvel has decided to change the monotony and trust me a change is necessary here because what was earlier shown to us was a combination of 21 movies and since Phase 4 will introduce us to new a broader world of MCU, I think we should appreciate this. This movie according to me was nothing more than a new spectacle wonderfully executed. Marvel team has always focused on the details and depth of the storyline. So, if there is any unanswered question, it will be answered soon but have patience because marvel movies have always been connected to each other."
2633,5,"Visually Stunning, yes. Good....not necessarily Eternals (2021) is directed by Chloe Zhao and it stars Gemma Chen as Sersi, Richard Madden as Icarus, Angeline Jolie as Thena and Salma Hayek as Ajak among many other actors to create this stacked cast. Does this entry to the MCU deserve eternal praise? Let's find out.The PlotThe plot has many distinct differences from other MCU films. It involves questions of morality and the extent to which we will preserve life. As a result, the line between a hero and villain dynamically changes throughout the runtime. Certain events desire multiple perspectives from different points in time. Furthermore, this movie has the most title cards in any MCU movie. This turned me off from the film because I constantly got confused at different points in the plot due to a lack of order. Ultimately, the plot is convoluted and leaves much for us to desire. However, the characters are really intriguing in this film. Let's talk about the characters.The CharactersI thought that the Eternals team has some of the most interesting characters yet. However their powers aren't necessarily unique. For example, as shown by the 2nd trailer, Icarus has the powers of Superman due to his ability to shoot lasers out of his eyes. Another character has similar powers as Loki. Although a couple of characters don't have unique powers there are some exceptions. Sersi played by Gamma Chen is able to manipulate matter and this leads to some beautiful visuals in the film. Also, the relationships between all the characters are really fleshed out and I deeply cared about what might happen to them. Specifically the character dynamics between Thena and Gilgamesh and the interaction between Icarus and Sersi. Ajak serves an important role in the film. She effectively grounds the team and introduces us to the world. She also becomes a strong motivation for our characters. Although the Eternals aren't human they certainly have some qualities of humanity. As a result, the search for humanity is a highlight of the film. Now let's talk about the cinematography.The CinematographyThe Director of cinematography for this film, Ben Davis, effectively uses diverse long shots. Specifically, beautiful long shots of space, the desert, and their ship. I believe that this is the best cinematography to touch the MCU yet. It also captures the grandiose nature of this ambitious film. So if you love diverse shots and compositions, then you may really enjoy this film. Now let's talk about the villains.VillainsAs shown by the trailers, the Eternals battle the deviants which are apex predators that feed on people. However, since they are brainless predators, they don't have much character. Not only do they not have character, but the CGI diminishes their realism. As a result, they really are just a punching bag for our heroes. These monsters are actually a background for the real villain of this film. I felt like the villains plan was bland. The complexity of the world disconnected me from the central conflict between our heroes and the deviants. As a result, I was really just waiting till the end credit scene.ConclusionSo although the characters are unique, the villains are bland and need more development. If you really enjoy visual spectacle and world building, I'll recommend this film to you. However, if don't want to wait through the first two acts to get to some action, then this film is not for you. I personally enjoyed the visual spectacle and characters, but the story and villains weren't for me. I'm going to the give Marvel's Eternals a 5/10."
2634,10,"A beautiful, epic film. My girlfriend saw this on opening day in IMAX as we do all Marvel films.The cast, locations, direction and visuals were fantastic, all supported by a beautiful Ramin Djawadi score.Congratulations to the cast and crew, I'll be going to watch it again."
2635,9,How did the fookin' critics rate this so bad? Eternals ain't that typical MCU flick. Those dumbheads keep on chanting MCU is making clichéd movies and will fxxk up soon.. Now their ____ are on fire because they revoked their formula?Eternals doesn't include any tony stark like playboy things.. Nor does it contain bloodshed. It is well suited for the philosophical thinkers and theorists with a bunch of foreshadowing elements and emotional drama. Best for the people who think The last season's of Game of Thrones is a little bit justifiable (still it ain't that good).It focuses on relationships and morality.. The crude question of where does our true allegiance lie? And what actually morality is..For the d**kheads who are rating without watching the movie..Go..have some fresh air.. Because you're not out of the nests that the outdated traditions taught you. There ain't anything awkward in seeing two men kiss..This movie is seriously bombed by the homophobic b**tards.People who expect Endgame like experience will surely be upset because this is just a basement building upto a massive eternal flick with Arishem the judge owing to grant our planet its judgement day. More celestials to come.. Kudos to the actors and the vfx team.. The massive towering celestials were the best in this film. Kit Harington does know a lot of History in this movie(He is a professor in natural history museum) But he still doesn't know anything about himself 😂NB: Thanos has a hot brother out their.. (He ain't purple )
2636,10,"Great enough to get me to watch all remaining7 Zhao movies Honestly I adore this movie.I feel like the characters are really endearing, each of them breaking under the weight of the past and present in different ways.The plot runs slightly slower than most from this studio but it still runs at a constant pace and honestly I love it and how the characters play off the situation throughout.I don't get the whole ""not enough jokes"", ""feels different"" etc used as a reason for it being bad.If you engage with the movie on its own terms it's actually very good."
2637,7,A question mark on the after mcu This movie made me ask myself how do you think what will happen after? 156min was full for this movie to tell us about 10 eternals character BUT not a best film and not good as shang-chi.
2638,10,"Great film. Ignore the negativity. Go in with an open mind. I got to see Marvel Eternals. A Chloe Zhao film. It offers something different to the other films. Interesting to follow the journey of immortal beings. In the beginning the Celestials were here. They created the Eternals. But hidden in the darkness were the Deviants. This specific team are on board a ship. They head to Earth. They weren't to meddle in human affairs. You get to see what they get up to throughout the ages. Some humour. Nice bit of drama and romance. Plenty of action. You will like the special effects and soundtrack. Great cast of actors. I like the Ikaris character. Superb powers. He is handsome. I like the powers of Makkari. Richard Madden could have played Superman. The Deviants thought to have been destroyed are making a comeback. Other secrets are revealed. The heroes had split up and lived their lives as they saw fit. Sersi and Thena looking hot. The team are to report back to Arishem. Worth looking at the back story. The credits scenes need explanation. One casting choice was a surprise. I want to see how this film is connected to others. It is a pretty good film. I would ignore the reviews. There are the fake reviews written by rightwingers that don't want to see poc on the screen. They use ""woke"" ""diversity"" in a negative way. One country wants to censor the film. Ridloff is currently in The Walking Dead and Lee was in Train To Busan. Each character has a unique power. Some youtuber or blogger mentioned Mutants. You might like The Old Guard, Highlander."
2639,7,"WYLION - Will we be 'Eternal'y grateful? A lot of promise, very nice to see new characters with different powers. For a Marvel film, I did feel emotionally invested in some parts which is good. Would have benefitted from extending the run time to explain more background behind certain aspects of the story."
2640,8,"Pleasantly surprised, Don't listen to the haters This was a great movie. I have been a marvel fan for many years and watched almost all the movies. I didn't know what this one was going to be about, only the fact that it is set after Endgame. However, that didn't diminish my enjoyment with this movie. Most of the stuff was explained really nicely (however some stuff was done a bit too ""easy"", however I didn't really mind at all), and it was an entertaining watch overall. I'm also super doped for the sequel-- hello did you watch the ending?? (SPOILER?: HARRY STYLES as Thanos's brother? Wow didn't expect that one haha)I LOVED the cinematography, humor, characters and plot, and would definitely recommend giving it a go! I don't really get all the hate the movie gets, as it was a good movie. Yes, it is a bit different from the previous marvel movies, but I think its good that MCU is trying new and different things, as it will expand their already big and wondrous world :)"
2641,10,"Love it As the first movie for MCU's next phase, I think this movie did a fantastic job introducing new superheroes, new storylines. I look forward to future movies in this new phase."
2642,8,Great Visual Effects & a beautiful story Eternals looks stunning. The story is good but i felt it to be a tad minimalistic. It could've been more inventive in story. But anyway i watched the film in IMAX 3D and was not disappointed with the cinematography and the music by Ramin Djawadi 🔥🔥
2643,8,"A quality first instalment A really well rounded introduction to so many new characters. Looking forward to how these events will tie into the whole MCU timeline. Definitely deserves more love than its seemingly getting, in my opinion. Go watch it!"
2644,9,"Eternals (2021) In an age where superhero movies are churned out at an industrial level rate, it's a breath of fresh air when a movie within this genre turns up giving you something new to behold.Eternals follows a family of superheros sent to earth to protect humans from predators known as the Deviants. The film follows them first arriving on Earth, 7000 years ago and then in the modern day teaming up again to save the day once more.After winning an Academy Award for Directing Nomadland, Chloe Zhao is an inspired choice to direct this intimately beautiful story about a dysfunctional family that learns what it means to be human. After all, her indie darlings have all been focused on humanity and character driven pieces.Eternals is beautifully balanced by showcasing the relationship between these characters, whether it is the on and off century spanning relationship between Gemma Chan's lead, Sersi and her beloved Ikaris (Richard Madden). Or even the platonic love between the broken and suffering Thena (Angelina Jolie) and her hardy protector Gilgamesh (Don Lee).The film introduces ten new characters and somehow manages to equally display all their relationships and all their powers, giving them much more nuance and complex interactions then many Marvel solo outings that focus on singular characters.Zhao was also brought on board to visually give the Marvel universe a kick up the backside, we are all too accustomed to the green screen backgrounds Iron Man is flying on where you can clearly see the actors are interacting with nothing but a tennis ball. Eternals changes this, giving life to every scene as most was shot on beautiful locations, allowing the action and visual effects to be steeped in reality.The humour between characters feels effortless, with Kumail Nanjiani really providing the laughs and the action is incredibly exciting when it takes off with a special mention must be given to the visually stunning speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridlofff). I sorely recommend seeing this in IMAX, the visual effects and just the entire epic scope of this picture alone is something to behold. There are genuine jaw dropping scenes that are made for the biggest screen possible.The entire diverse ensemble do great work, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden prove solid leads with their complex relationship. Don Lee and Angelina Jolie are standouts, providing a warm and heartfelt storyline. Barry Keoghan, Brian Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh and Lauren Ridloff also make for great members of the ensemble, giving some of the most genuinely exciting action sequences as well as unexpectedly deep character interactions. Salma Hayek and Kit Harington make the most with their brief screen time. Die-hard superhero fans wil also want to stick around for the two credits scenes!This film will not be for everyone, it is patiently paced, allowing every character to have their moment, whilst dealing with incredibly mature themes on humanity that most superhero movies refuse to go. This is not your typical mindless action flick. Marvel and most likely Chloe Zhao have made the first indie feeling superhero movie that is a brilliant blend of incredibly jaw dropping spectacle and deep themes on love and what it means to truly be human.I hope this is a start for Marvel to take more risks and bring in more exciting filmmakers to create not just a superhero film but character driven pieces that really change the landscape of this oversaturated genre."
2645,6,"Important film for the MCU, but unfortunately quite boring I am quite the MCU fan, but never read any source material. So I judge this film accordingly.What we learn in this movie is clearly going to be important for the path forward within the MCU, so it needs to be watched. But watching it was a bit of a chore.The movie spends a looong time giving us the backstory to the Eternals role as they were placed on Earth 7000 years ago. A LOT. We're talking 45 minutes of flashback from thousands of years ago.But unfortunately, instead of coloring the characters, making them relatable, giving them personal goals and challenges and making us care whether or not they can overcome them, its all just visually stimulating history-channel material. When you don't feel for the characters, so much falls flat and becomes dialogue that simply becomes informative, and not compelling.The actions scenes are fun, and very well made. Several quite spectacular scenes occasionally redeems the watchability. But they are so far apart that it doesnt even come close to making me want to watch this again. And that becomes the case when the actions scenes are the only part worth re-watching, which itself is a bit sad.The movie kinda does the dual bad-guy thing, with one bad guy getting a very solid build up, and the other sort of on the sideline until the end. The actual interesting bad guy story arc (with a build up) is very abruptly finished off, while the other takes over. Im sorry, but this is just so unsatisfying, and I dont understand what the writers were thinking about here.I really wanted this movie to be great. Its story, as said, is something you need to know if you want to stay up to speed with the MCU, but with so much plain information-talking, backstory that feels mandatory to watch but does nothing for the build-up, and cool action scenes miles apart, I think this could become the first of all MCU movies that I will only watch once. It's not the worst of the lot (*cough* Iron Man 2), but it would still be the most painful to rewatch.I don't want to rate this out of frustration, so I give it a 6. A 6,5 perhaps, but that's not an option IMDB gives us.All in all, this movie is like a story told where the storyteller needs to explain a bunch of terms and backstory before he can actually tell it, and then failing to make all the pre-explanations feel worth the time it took to listen. But as said, all that information will surely be useful later; it just didnt do much to make this particular story very interesting."
2646,7,"Not the worst MCU film, neither the best The answer to the question that most are asking, following the huge internet buzz that resulted from the release of critics ratings, is this: it is definitely far from being the worst MCU film, but as a MCU film, it's not the most memorable one, even if, thanks to Zhao, visually and storyline-wise it is one of the most distinct Marvel films.Zhao's film balances rather safely between being a film belonging to the MCU system and being a Zhao film. There are minor elements of Zhao's cinematic poetics that permain. Even if Zhao's touch is palpable, what prevails is the dimension of the film as a MCU film.In an almost unprecedented fashion, Eternals is non-linear in its story structure, one of its many perks. The issue in the first 40 minutes of the movie is that the flashback scenes prove to be more interesting than the main storyline. It feels almost as if this parallel storyline could have been expanded in a more interesting full feature film. Eventually, threads are connected and the non-linear structure becomes interconnected enough to justify the unification of the subjects in one single film, but the ""present day"" storyline lacks coherence in some aspects.Ultimately, the biggest issue of Eternals is inherently linked to it being an MCU film. The Marvel signature approach, that demystifies superhero characters and turns them into comic figures, flawed and human, hardly works well for a set of god-like entities with millenary lifespan that have guided the early evolution of mankind, such as the Eternals.In terms of MCU lore, Eternals brought forward a vast area of expansion, that if implemented well, might possibly lead to new directions for the franchise. Weighing the pros and cons, Eternals leans more towards the postive, but its flaws prevents it from utmost greatness.(full review on comeandreview)"
2647,8,"Phase Four Continues!!! Irkaris is MCU's Superman!! I saw this movie on the second day of its release, and being part of the casual audience category I liked the movie. It was hell of a spectacular movie no doubt because of the VFXs and cinematography. What I liked the most about it is that it doesn't rely too much on the past events, and keeps its focus on the main storyline, and yeah there were some references made here and there, but still casual mcu watcher will be able to apprehend. Overall I don't regret watching it in theatre and I highly recommend you guys to check it out."
2648,8,"This is why you make up your own mind. This movie was not only spectacular on a grand scale, it also did a fantastic job of making the smaller and more intimate moments just as important. I truly don't understand the hate this film has gotten beyond people just letting their personal biases get in the way.Eternals is by no means perfect but there isn't actually a ""perfect"" comic book movie. I absolutely love the direction this seems to be taking the MCU in. This movie shows that Marvel is finally willing to let their films reflect the comics in a more mature and diverse way. I'm ready for it."
2649,9,"Eternals - Superheroes grounded on Earth Eternals are flawed. Like the Celestials. And Deviants.The journey is discovery. And with great power ... You get it. The origins story is nothing new.But the MCU has forged new grounds in trying something Differently. Diverse. Daring.Sexuality explored. Love and boredom.Chloe Zhao's landscape is beautiful but harsh.The criticisms are real. But when you leave the cinema, have you somehow fallen in love with this bunch of misfits and their love for planet earth? I did."
2650,5,"Ok. Very Middle of the road. Iron Man 2 was better. I had heard about all the bad reviews, but I'm the optimistic type because I absolutely love the two Venom movies. I walked into the theatre with very low expectations. I did the same with Michael Bay's TMNT movies and actually enjoyed them even though in reality they're both complete trash. Sadly, this wasn't the case with Eternals. The whole movie had the stank of pretense all over it. I did quite enjoy the Bollywood star Kingo, the angsty Peter Pan type, Sprite and the butt kicking but strangely sensitive Gilgamesh. I also thought that the action sequences were quite cool. I jumped when the deviant swooped in out of nowhere and grabbed Ikaris. Now, that being said, the pacing in this film was awful. I whispered to my wife I'm bored on more than one occasion. I'm usually not the one to talk during a movie but I don't think anyone cared because we all shared a hive mind when it came to what we were watching. I don't have a problem when a movie is long. For example, Endgame is the longest MCU film yet but it goes by like the snap the of a finger (literally) This however feels like an eternity (ok I'm finished with the puns for now). I feel if they would have replaced one of the boring characters with Patton Oswalt's Pip the Elf, who shows up in the mid credits scene, I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more! Closing argument. Don't even bother red boxing it. Definitely don't buy it. Not even on Black Friday. Wait till it's free on Disney Plus!"
2651,8,Better than Black Widow and Venom 2 Not as bad as critics are saying but not a blockbuster as well. The story was very mediocre and felt it was rushed it would have been better if the movie could have been done in 2 parts like Infinity war and endgame with proper introduction to all the characters and their origin especially Arshem. But I still enjoyed this film all thanks to Chloe Zhao's direction skills and the also the humor felt very balanced to me and not to forget that this was one of the best visually creative movie in the MCU.
2652,8,"The same quality and production values you've come to expect, but with a different plot focus. Another thoroughly enjoyable superhero movie with superb special effects and action scenes, epic battles and world-threatening villains. The style and plot of the movie is different; it's a lot more mature and emotionally driven, focusing on the characters and the role of humanity on the planet, but still has a few lighter moments and it never felt long. Great acting from the varied cast, especially Chan as the lead, but I'm not sure how it will stand out as being memorable in the years to come."
2653,10,"VISUALLY BEAUTIFUL AND AWESOME TWISTS Awesome story it may be long but very intresting,don't believe rotten tomatoes this is one of the best marvel movies ever the post credit scenes are unexpected, director did an awesome job Kingo and his partner karun did an awesome job they brought the humour."
2654,10,"Great! Can't wait for part2!! It was a very good storyline, angelina was hot. Hot hot. I need 150 characters to give the fuc..ing review. The special effect were best!!!!!!!!! So amazibg. 150 chatacters is a lot...im bored of this review but the movie was so cool!! Go to cinema and eat some nachos."
2655,7,"You can probably arrive a mid movie and still not miss it I guess I'm going to divide this movie in two parts. The first part that consists of a very long introduction to characters that nobody knows them. Who are the eternals? What's the role in earth... Etc. Not your typical vigilante hero. That part was super long and extremely detailed oriented. Some people may like all details. Personally I don't. I think it was overdone.Then the second part where the action movie really begins. That part was great, with some unexpected plot twists about the villains. Special effects and fight scenes are awesome. Kudos to visuals, sound effects, acting. All of that was great.Strengths: special effects, action fight scenes. Purpose Weakness; very very long character development. Too many characters, so not enough screen time for all characters."
2656,4,"Sadly disappointing The problem here is not the gender nor the personality or the orientation of the characters. I'm perfectly fine with that. The problem is watching a movie with so many storylines, background and flashbacks that finally succumbs to its own ambition. Another problem is having plenty of characters, all of them unknown (because if we at least know two or three of them it would be an extraordinary help) and not knowing even what to do with all of them properly. And one more problem is a pacing that doesn't help, and I'm someone who watched a lot of slow burners. Such a shame, because I wanted to like this and prove all their haters were wrong. Not the worst MCU movie to me, but -yeah- one of the worst."
2657,9,Movie is amazing(spoiler alert) So guys the movie is good the way zhoa handled the direction of the movie is good it's like they are showing their at the same present timeline which is so good and interesting though there are some lag scenes but it's fine so the director showed the entire story of eternals and who are celestials how do they born and maybe eternals 2 will be great finally i loved it go and watch it.The visuals are on another level . Great work team eternals.
2658,9,A different take on a superhero story I loved this!!! Not sure why the early hate but this was done beautifully. Maybe it's not EndGame but we don't always need the same kind of superhero movie.Character driven and took its time telling its story. And the action sequences were done amazingly and looked so cool. This was not the movie I thought I was gonna see from the trailers but the surprises were brilliant!! The cast all worked so well together!!! I definitely will go and pay to see this again!
2659,9,Loved it. A movie that stands out in the MCU. The movie is really different from the rest of the MCU movies. Chloe Zhao does a really good job of acquainting us with all these characters within a limited time frame. This movie was an emotional journey for me. The cast also does a really good job. The vfx is excellent. The background score is perfect. I personally loved the movie and is excited to see more of the Eternals and Dane Whitman. The difference from rest of the superhero movies is what makes this movie stand out.
2660,9,"Not sure what all the haters were watching! Visually stunning and fast paced, I do feel I need to watch Eternals again to really take it all in, but the characters are interesting and well developed considering how many there were to introduce. The time span involved means that the film covers a lot of ground and though it's a long film It didn't feel like it. I love the tie-in to periods in our history. It's a shame we didn't see more of Kit Harrington or Lauren Ridloff, both of whom are great actors- I hope they get more screen time moving forward. Im looking forward to seeing how the characters are emerged into the wider MCU after this one, so much potential! Loved it."
2661,5,"Watchable but disappointing I feel this should of been 2 movies. They really focused on the characters background but it kept just short flashes of different time zones. I feel they tried to cram to much in that you miss out on a lot of the action. The short clips aren't really enough to satisfy you nor enough to time with each character to connect.Angelina Jolie is one of the biggest actors in the world. If they wanted to use her, they should of used her and not made her an extra. I'm sure she will be more relevant in future films but this did not help this film. I can't completely explain, it's not terrible but it does not live up to other Marvel films.The film was far too long, not enough action and not engaging enough. The characters don't mesh well together. But maybe that's where they where trying to be different. 2 or 3 maybe grew on me by the end but not enough to be excited by a 2nd film."
2662,8,"A more informative film I think it's not as bad as people said it. It's just a more informative one coz Marvel has to introduce 10 characters in a single film so I think you MUST know the character information before getting into the theatre... or else it will be quite confusing and make u feel boredBtw the special effects are amazing, I highly recommend you to watch IMAX."
2663,9,"Visually Stunning This movie was not perfect but it was very pleasing to watch. I enjoyed it very much and luckily kept up with the time jumps and flashbacks. Also liked the fact that most of the cast is never really watched before apart from the obvious ones - Richard Madden, Kit Harrington, Anjelina Jolie, Salma Hayek.Although had to laugh every time Ikarus and Dane kept saying Sersi - any GoT fans would know."
2664,10,"Ignore the critics! From what I saw from critics prior to the film they slated it and I still wasn't worried as they are generally wrong. I'll be honest, it's easily one of my favourite mcu films and I could easily watch it again.1) didn't feel like a 2.37 hour movie, felt too short haha left me wanting more, especially with the ending and end credit scenes 2) characters were amazing, each had their moments to shine, each played off each other well and everyone felt like they knew each other for thousands of years 3)story was fantastic, people are saying it lacks but how.... It gives backs story, it's at a nice pace to not let the film dip at all and it's a great plot with twists and love and comedy?!4)effects were top, like so good from super speed to deviant art was just amazing and fight scenes, yes the beach and amazon were so good!!!!5) still had that marvel comedy to it whilst sticking to an intense battling super hero film!Can't wait for a second and happy they left us with a cliffhanger movie and cliffhanger end credit scene!"
2665,7,Wow its not that bad. The story is a bit messy at the beginning but is a must see for fans of the MCU. Its far from the best film. But it is no where near as bad as the critics say. Look at rotten tomatoes audience score.Worth a watch just so you can judge it yourself.
2666,5,"Long and boring at times; little action Wanted to like it, but it was almost 3 hours with very little action aside from 2 or 3 scenes. Probably my least favorite MCU film. Almost fell asleep at one point, and the only other time that happened was Aquaman. Hope this isnt a sign to come for the next phase."
2667,10,A Masterpiece It is the most unique and beautiful superhero film I have ever seen. The scope and scale is so huge. I can't wait to see these amazing characters again.
2668,1,"What the hell.. can't believe it's from Marvel! I don'y know where to begin. Movie is just awful 1/10 (generous) Storyline, character, acting, action and everything was so bad!!! I can't believe this came from Marvel who has given Avengers, Captain America, Ironman... etc. Movies.I hope Marvel take the responsibility and listen to the fans."
2669,7,"Something new that we haven't really seen from Marvel before I gotta admit I enjoyed most of the film! However, there were some boring scenes and the film was incredibly long! I loved that it wasn't the same old ""Marvel template"" and we finally saw something new and interesting. I enjoyed how they cared about each other, you could have felt the love! Special effects were beautiful, I think this is one of the most beautiful Marvel film I have ever seen! The movie's placement was more serious than other movies' and there were less fight scenes than I expected to be, but there's nothing wrong with that! I liked it! It's all about taste and being open to new things. I think everyone who loves Marvel should see the movie and decide whether they liked it or not. Everyone has different opinions, especially on this film. I can totally understand those who didn't like it and I can understand those too, who loved the film."
2670,5,"This is the ""Cats"" of the Marvel universe I expected better Kevin. I expected better.One positive thing I can say is this makes Thor: Dark World look amazing.And Ryan Reynolds is high-fiving himself right now. The stigma of being the date of the worst super hero movie ever is in the past. It's ok Ryan. It's over now. And there's 10 of them to share the load."
2671,5,"It was okay.... Tldr; Rather long - too much filling for the pie.There are reasons some people will hate on this film, that one of the characters kisses his same sex partner is one. Ignore these people. They would not complain if it had been a goodbye kiss of the opposite sex, and these people need to be part of the world. Some people are gay.Some will use coded language to express displeasure at the representation in the casting. Those people can take a long hard look at themselves.It is possible to have issues with a film without it automatically being for these issues.For me, I felt the film had structural issues and would have been better split into two. It was burdened with introducing a huge number of characters, developing them, and in a few cases, killing them off. There was a certain amount of story to cover if the characters could be integrated into the wider MCU, AND the film felt over-full. My solution?Split the film.FIlm 1: The Eternals land. They fight deviants. They seed various bits of human advancement. They defeat the Eternals, Thena gets calmed. Druig storms off with his band. The Eternals separate and have a 'happy ending'.After a pause to let the audience digest.Film 2: We pick up at the modern day, we find that Sersi is no longer with Icarus. The deviants return - and we start to get the twists.Each story gets more time to breath, and we get to know characters before the betrayals and twists. After the first film, and the elapsed time, the impact of the twists is increased.As things stood, there was *so* much story to fit in it felt like ""and another thing""..... so many characters at once, and in a few cases there was little time to 'live with them' before they met an end."
2672,9,Wtf this was very good The critics can be hit or miss but man this was a huge miss. The movie had great pacing and a lot of heart. I was never bored and the comedy was perfectly timed.
2673,9,Very ambitious and very entertaing The movie has to do a lot to make the audience understand what they are watching since the majority dont know about the eterals comics. Never the less the movie does a good job on making the characters likeable and making them feel very human. The movie is very entertaining not only because of the settings of the story and the cgi but it also gives you things to think about. Some of my only problems in this movie is that stuff happens before it has any significance but overall the movie is undestandable and very ambitious with its world building for the mcu.
2674,9,"Saw Eternals and realised that sometimes critics can be very very wrong. So here's my review of eternals and the movie is a solid 4.5/5 .The movie is amazing, certainly not the best MCU movie but definitely not the worst like the critics say. It's actually above the average. The movie actually has quite good pacing as long as you are an actual Marvel fan and you are interesting in learning more about the history of the MCU and new stories in the universe.The fights are amazing and plentiful for a non Avengers movie although you would want more cause it is that good.The movie does have a big story to tell but Chloe Zhao does an amazing job of telling that story. The movie does cut back a little on the snappy one liners but it's still plenty funny, mostly because of karun i.e. Kingo's trusted assistant.It does have an open ending that leaves a lot of questions unanswered and the post credit scene just add more questions."
2675,8,"The Future of Marvel This movie is clear progress into a better cinema era.Pros- Thought out, different characters. Liked them all.GOOD representation for anyone. Different race? Boom heres half the eternals of different races. Sexuality? BOOM we have 2 loving dads. Hard of hearing? BOOOM WE GOT A COOL DEAF SUPER HERO. This film really did focus on the characters, and i enjoyed that a ton. They all felt like people and I could relate myself to at least 2 characters. Plot wise its a shaky start, but i see long potential for more movies Cons- The movie lacks in the clear department. I was confused for at least 30 minutes it felt like and thrown into character death that I didn't know how to feel about. However I will say, as I learned about each character I understood more and more, and began to actually mourn for any characters dying. I just wish I wasn't confused for such a long time at the beginning of the movie.Overall or TLDR; I cannot wait to see where they take the characters and I hope that they improve some writing to make info more clear. I'm so excited Marvel released this. WHOHOOO PROGRESS!!!"
2676,9,"A masterpiece about love A film about love, free will, feelings and empathy. This is Eternals. Perhaps the best Marvel movie ever, certainly something new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The strength of the film are the characters, immortal but fallible heroes, like each of us. 7000 years of creating a family, friendships, loves and relationships.A large, well-directed painting, in which the flashbacks always give something more to the plot and the characters. Passed, with full marks."
2677,10,Dazzlingly Different! What a wonderful film! Loved this take on the MCU. The characters and their dialogue pulled me in and pulled me in deep. I was so in love with this movie twenty minutes in. It isn't like every other Marvel film and I think that is why some people aren't liking it. They wanted to be spoon-fed instead of using their brains. This is a MUST see and I will be going back time and time again. I loved everyone in it!
2678,7,One of the best looking marvel movies The movie has great visuals including one of the best acting scenes in the MCU. The number of characters made it difficult to understand and connect to each of them but all the main character were explored properly. Hope to see more of them.
2679,10,ETERNALS It's is a great movie! ETERNALS.It's not really like a marvel movie!And with a soild story................ And has got a great post credit scene.
2680,7,"Not as bad as most reviews make it seem, but certainly a movie with flaws The top review as I'm writing this is some dude panning this film, claiming to be a ""Marvel Zombie"" and challenging readers to check his review history to verify and lend credibility to himself as a trustworthy critic of all things Marvel. I took a look through his posting history and uhh.. didn't like Shang Chi, didn't like Captain Marvel (on account of the actress being too leftist?), thought Iron Man 3 and Avengers Age of Ultron were the examples of movies ""back when Marvel was good"". Anyways, I thought this dude (user: sidfargas) is a good encapsulation of the type of person who thought this movie was garbage. Not that the movie is phenomenal, but the critique is overblown, often by those who prefer their movies and studios without an diversity or risk-taking.Anyways, onto the actual review. Couple of positives, couple of negatives. Overall a decent film. In the company of Phase 4 Marvel movies, I'd say this is behind Shang-Chi and ahead of Black Widow (though the gap between this and Shang-Chi is far greater than the gap between this and Black Widow).Lets start with the positives: Visual design is very good in this movie (great CG directing from the ILM team, props to them and Chloe Zhao for that aspect). Very attractive cast, good job guys. 3rd act conflict didn't feel trite like a typical formulaic Marvel CGI army fight, due largely to the nature of the conflict shifting and the movie evenly distributing CGI sequences throughout the duration of the movie. Felt similar to the resolution of WandaVision. Angelina Jolie is a top tier actress in here. Richard Madden plays a very interesting character, and the rest of the cast have solid chemistry. Also, fantastic plot devices (SPOILER AHEAD IN THESE PARENTHESIS, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE AND PLAN TO: There were like 2 major twists in the film, and I didn't see either of them coming. Good job on the story telling part of that, I was pleasantly surprised)Now the negatives: script writing felt a little strange. Some dialogue was really on the nose, motifs were repeated out loud rather than left for the audience to discover, comedic relief, while mostly very solid, was a little too constant. Pacing in the interpersonal relationships was rushed, largely in part to fitting 10+ new ""main"" characters into a 2.5 hr movie is no easy task. The stakes were large and the power scaling of the entire MCU is now very strange as a result.I think the sum of it is: Eternals was a very ambitious project in size and scale. Typically, Marvel is very good about exceeding apprehensive expectations to larger than life film-making and storytelling challenges (Guardians of the Galaxy, Civil War, Endgame, hell even the OG Iron Man), but this time, they really did bite off a bit more than they could chew. I think the dialogue was too weak and the interpersonal relationships to uncomfortably shallow for this to be marked as a narrative success by Marvel. In all, a decent watch, but with the talent invested in this movie, I hope to see major improvements in the next installments of whatever comes next for the Eternals."
2681,10,"Unique, entertaining, and visually stunning! I really don't understand all the bad reviews. Based on some of these reviews, I was expecting it be really bad and boring. This movie is somehow being rated lower than Thor 2 which does not feel (personally) accurate. Although it is a 2 hour and 37 minute movie, I did not find myself checking the time to see when it would be over. I was fully entertained the whole time. The story of the Eternals and how they came to be was easy to follow and made sense. They did a good job of showcasing all 10 of the Eternals which is no easy feat. I did wish they had used some actors/actresses more but overall the acting was superb. This movie definitely felt important in setting up the storyline for future Marvel movies, so I'm really excited to see what's next.P. S there are two post-credit scenes so stay for those if you can!"
2682,7,"Don't be led by the crittic reviews or YouTube videos This film is good. Its not a fantastic epic like Infinity War or Endgame. Its not as fast paced as other MCU movies and there are a lot of talking sections. However, even with all this I left the cinema satisfied with what I saw.I urge anyone who's not seen this movie to hold judgement and make the decision for themselves and not be led by crittic reviews and YouTube videos. There are some ridiculous titles praising the films 'failure' which is sad. Watch Chris Stuckmans review of The Last Duel as he hits the nail on the head in that video.Eternals lays out the foundations to future movies and D+ shows. It introduces new characters that I look forward to seeing more of in the upcoming films and shows.Hold out for the end credit scenes as both are great."
2683,7,Not a masterpiece The Visual effects were really high. But the movie misses a strong villan. The movie also can be done within 2 hours. But the movie is not so bad as critic said. It is a good movie but not a masterpiece.
2684,1,"Very disappointed Nothing new here most the cast was dull and dry, just another one of those get team members together for an hour and 30 mins then they got to figure out everything and then there's just a lot of horrible acting. It's pretty much they made this then put the extra credit scene at the end hoping that will get you to see if nothing else will. Worst MCU movie Disney dropped the ball on this, like they did with Star Wars."
2685,3,"So many unlogical things For the first part (until the break) it can work, even tough there is too much jumping in and out from history to know all the characters, which have no chemistry between each other btw, just NONE.What is the point of Thena, they just ruined her. This could be absolutely the same movie without her. Also why would Celestials build Eternals with flaws?Icarus had to try to kill them all before he turns good guy in a second, after which he blows himself in the sun?? So he abandoned his life mission, the way they were programmed by Celestials in a blink of an eye? Like ""Im not gonna let you do that, I will kill you all."" Next second. ""OK, do it!""???So. Much. Confusion.""I always wanted to cut your wings!"" - WHY??? What happened between them? There was absolutely no bonding in between characters.Dissapointed."
2686,1,"Boring movie Very boring movie words to mcu movie very disappointed in mcu. I hope they just can not make movie part 2.the movie is very slow and scene not good it's average,"
2687,10,"ETERNALS ASSEMBLE. Wow. Simply wow. At the moment I'm thinking how can the reviews be so bad for such an amazing movie. Every element of this movie is so unique; the cast is diverse, cultures are diverse, each age passing through evolution was done so perfectly visually something you've never seen, unlike any other Marvel film focusing on emotions more than actions... And honestly that's important and the entire team of Marvel Studios Eternals has done a perfect job at creating Eternals. Every aspect of the film has touched deeply and has made my day.I could just keep on complimenting the film... It was so so so well done. Totally an IMAX experience. Go watch it in theatres. It is a well deserved film... Please go with an open mind and ignore the negative comments. This film is AMAZING, WONDERFUL, WOWWWWWW.Congratulations to the entire team for Marvel Studios ETERNALS."
2688,3,"Kids movie by CartoonNetwork No logic. Poor direction. Poor story. Poor character build up. Poor acting!!Lost interest initially itself.Its fit for less than 5 years old, not for elders."
2689,8,A great introduction to something big This is not a typical marvel movie.But offers so much for next phases that I can easily look past some dull moments.Visuals were stunning and Gemma chan stole the show with great performance from Richard madden and Angling Jolie.Others were great too!!
2690,7,"Conflicting - some parts great, some parts not I'm conflicted. Some parts were great, some parts were really not.GOOD: Great action and visuals, like always. Loved the humor, just super funny at times. Great philosophical and moral questions. I think the characters were overall great. A good plot twist or two.BAD: Some of the characters got shorted on screen-time and development (but what do you expect when they're are 10 of them). This even included the ""big bad"" deviant, who was totally under-utilized in all respects. Also fairly inconsistent in how some characters are treated/utilized (e.g. Is Sprite childish, or is she mature like a 7000-year-old should be?) Some plot twists were too predictable.This one starts to remove the possibility of the existence of a real God in the MCU. Definitely tries to vilify religion."
2691,9,"Do not listen to the critics First of all DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS. This movie was absolutely amazing! After watching the trailer for the first time I was super thrilled to go watch another add on to the MCU, however after seeing the ratings were not that good I turned a little skeptical, but oh boy I should have trusted my gut. This movie has absolutely everything starting from visuals, action, romance, representation and a pretty well built storyline. Eternals was definitely different than any MCU movie BUT in a good way. Seriously, just go watch it and see it for yourself, you won't be disappointed."
2692,1,"A disjointed mess This movie has no plot and what little story is there is disjointed. What is up with the flying chocolate bar and why didn't the sun melt it? Why were the villages being attacked? Why are the ""villains"" so generic?I wasn't invested in most of the characters. The costumes were very lame. I've seen better Cosplay at comic conventions. The one character that was interesting to me wasn't developed (Sprite). The casting was bad and made little sense. Why would a race of eternal beings include one that is deaf? 7000 years of life experience and no super power to compensate for that? Why is an Indian character played by a Pakistani? Is that the reason the Bollywood stuff was so cringy? Why is a Scott playing a Greek? Why is a Korean playing a Sumerian? The casting was all over the place.The directing is also a mess. Chloe Zhao is a decent enough director but her style is not at all appropriate to a superhero movie.There were all most no people in the theater I went to and I was so bored with the movie that I was nodding off during the parts that were quiet.If you like the bits that are visual eye candy and prefer a movie that is far too long and has no plot or story this movie is for you."
2693,7,bahala na putang ina Not the best mcu movie but this movie is setting up future mcu movies like blade and this movie also is setting up new heroes in the mcu like afox black knight and most probably the most anticipated hero which is adam warlock.
2694,10,Best Movie In MCU This film is just incredible. Everything is perfect. The actors and actresses are all amazing. Chloe Zhao did a very good job. I loved the CGI. But the best thing about this film is the plot. There are many plot twists. I really don't know why critics hate this movie.P. S. You should stay and watch both post credit scenes which are mind-blowing.
2695,7,"Choppy, Yet Beautiful Cinematography Choppy editing, yet beautiful cinematography. Cast dynamic was great. Little slow. Exposition scenes were dense. Could've shown, and not told us certain things. Character motivation was eh. I expect more from the Mcu at this point."
2696,10,"If you are expecting a generic marvel movie you will be disappointed. I went into the theater expecting this movie to be terrible. Instead I was throughly entertained. Great storyline, great action, and lots of good humor. It was unique and that is what I loved about it most."
2697,10,"The stuff of my dreams I loved this n a big bad way. From the narrative, to the acting, to the cinamtography and the writing. To the spin on the group fighting icaris/superman. Loved it."
2698,1,"Genuinely disappointing If you're looking for superheroes, look away. This is a group that justifies all manner of bad choices. No ethics here. Gaping plot holes. An uncomfortable lack of chemistry between characters. I was so looking forward to this movies and it fell short in a big way. The one star is for Kumail Nanjiani-don't underestimate the power of the supporting character!"
2699,7,"Its not the best MCU movie but its not the worst either............Its GOOD Eternals is that weird movie thats not entirely mcu like or entirely chloe zhao like. I actually like that about it a lot. Some characters are likeable whereas some are really bad. Also excited for Black night a lot. I didnt also like the arishem aspect of things but this movie does so many things right , its hard to ignore."
2700,5,"Meh This one unfortunately lands in the bottom tier for Marvel. There was a lot of potential, and the action, like all Marvel, is well done. Angelina Jolie and Don Lee were also a highlight.However, the writing held this project back. There is an especially egregious moment about halfway through where the plot comes grinding to a halt and the bad guy monologues for a good 10 minutes. This is frustrating, because all the information is later shown in more organic ways. For such a long movie, there's unfortunately little character growth and a heck of a lot of people explaining super special plot devices that will magically save the world."
2701,5,"So much potential but ... Good - beautiful and diverse cast + great colors/visuals (mostly) + introduction of new characters/beings big and small + seeds for future movies + post credit scenes + nice array of cultures shownMeh - though they were likeable, there was no depth to any of the characters + most of the movie was an information dump + though the story had a lot of potential and should have been interesting, the delivery was blandly executed + script was flat + some of the major events seemed forced (and less impactful because you weren't invested into the characters) + not even the formulaic MCU banter and wit (love it or hate it ... this movie needed it ... even the funny parts weren't more than humorous) + cultures and historical scenes were also more superficially offered and another lost opportunity (more color and visuals than richness)Ugly - nothing."
2702,2,"Felt like an eternity! I wanted Deadpool to show up and end this! First, do the actors read the script when offered a Marvel film? I can't see them reading this saying wow this is a winner. I'm thinking they just thought oh, Marvel movies are all the rage, this can't miss. As far as what I think, it's getting too far from the core for me.I felt ZERO or fun or adventure in this movie, it was depressing and boring. I didn't like anybody in this movie not a single one. To get the bad feelings out of my mind I went back and watched the original Spider-Man which I hadn't watched in years, it was like night and day, very fun to watch. Some of these new Marvel movies are trying to be too much hollywood too serious, why so serious? I wanted Deadpool to show up and end this part of the Marvel Universe. So this is just a hard pass from me, and my worst rated Marvel movie to date.Stay home and watch something good from the past, hopefully they learn from these failures and don't just keep repeating them."
2703,8,"Good movie, but too long Its seems that there's no unnecessary scenes, and yet it feels like it could be half an hour shorter.Beside that, the story is very interesting, and it's a good movie overall..."
2704,5,"Marvel does a DC Very less humor, confusing and boring.Marvel will need to go back to the drawing board. Every few often they come up script like Thor 2 or Iron Man 3 which makes you think why did you waste 2.5 hours of your life about a slow drama.And why so much Bollywood reference and dialogues. It's like reverse brain drain, Bollywood movies try to copy Hollywood and this one is getting to become a Bollywood movie."
2705,6,"Different style This movie is so different from all the previous Marvel movies. If they didn't made reference about the Avengers, anyone watching Eternals would have thought it's a complete different universe. It does not feel like a super hero movie for sure. More like a movie where people with superpowers fight each other. I don't think any kids going to watch Eternals will ask their parents to buy any of the Eternals costumes for the next Halloween. None of these Heroes stand out. They don't inspire people and they're not relatable in a way to feel like a role model for people. It's just a good watch for the continuation of the MCU movies and main story."
2706,1,"How? How do people still enjoy these ""films?"" How can people still get excited about this copy-and-paste Marvel stuff? This genre has been absolutely beaten to death yet they're still trying to sap every last dollar out of it. This stuff is not good cinema anymore, At this point it's just exploitation. Yet people still watch it because they're told they should enjoy Marvel junk. Just let it die already, it's way past it's time."
2707,9,"""Eternals"" is both loads of fun and almost definitely the most ""mature"" Marvel film to date. When the Eternals were announced as being featured in a future Marvel films, I was pretty unimpressed. Having read the original series, I didn't see how the concept could possibly fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And with a the film being directed by Chloe Zhao, known only for the indie film ""Nomadland"" (which was not my cup of tea), I was less enthused. However, after seeing the film I was very pleasantly surprised.Eternals is a COSMIC Marvel film. In its premise, famous characters from mythology (Gilgamesh, Athena, Mercury, Icarus, Hephaestos, etc.) are revealed to have actually been a team of superbeings sent to Earth by ""space gods"" to help the development of mankind (kind of an ""Avengers"" of the Ancient World). The movie takes place in the present, but flashbacks document episodes from over the last 7000 years of human history. This gives the film the opportunity to take the audience to many different time periods and to many different regions of the Earth. It's a feast for the world history buff, that's for sure.As the film proceeds, these ageless ""Eternals"" start learning about their true mission on Earth, and have to make decisions which might affect not only Earth, but the future of many planets in the galaxy. Although this is a Marvel ""superhero"" film, it actually comes across more as a thoughtful science fiction epic. The Eternals are not humans who wear power suits or who have been given super-powers through artificial means, but are actually alien beings who have made Earth their home for thousands of years. In fact, these superbeings have lived on Earth long enough that they have taken on the emotional characteristics of humans. Now they must rise to defend their adopted home against their own godlike masters from outer space. In a bold move for a Disney product, this film presents some complex moral choices (at least on par with ""Captain America: Civil War""), and even at the end of the film there is an earned sense of consequence.Aside from the massive mythology that this film has to present, it also has 10 main characters to establish, each with their own personalities, powers and back history. In an amazing feat of pacing, the film manages to do just that, giving each character a meaningful introduction and arc.As usual for an MCU film, there are lots of visual-effects supporting battlescenes, but there also many scenes simply featuring the natural beauty of its locations as well as many scenes highlighting the diversity of global culture.In the end, ""Eternals"" is both loads of fun and almost definitely the most ""mature"" Marvel film to date. The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to be following the pattern the comics did in the 1970s by introducing more varied concepts incorporating elements of sf, horror and ""art-house"" than just super-strong capes. It's a very welcome move."
2708,10,"The Rebirth of a Nation. There is not much to add.In 1915 a blockbuster movie validated racism.In 2021 a movie caused outrage not even by calling them bigots out, but simply by portraying everything they hated as heros.The Eternals is a challenging movie to direct with 10 characters with their own micro character arc, its intimidating af to even attempt to write or specially edit this movie, the non linear was a difficultbut only choice. It was successfully done. I could not believe it was cohesive at all.Could it be done better? Maybe in an arthouse 5-10 hour movie. I am unaware if there is a precedent for a blockbuster of this size and relatively short runtime.The title of this review is meant to cause as much outrage as The Eternals. At the end of the day what I learnt is that we are irrelevant and small, minuscule filth in the universe, whatever good or bad you do while in here is all that matters, hating two people who kiss is what many focused on. Have yet to speak with someone who hated this movie and doesn't mention the hate towards ""inclusivity "" at some point."
2709,4,It does not feel like marvels I do not feel anything when i watched.It does not feel like marvels. I did not expect anything from it but honestly it feels like watching DC movie.Nothing new in the concept. No surprises.Even the cast is excellent but it felt lost it somehow.But this movie still deserves a chance.
2710,9,"""Loved It"" A very good movie. Enjoyed very much. Visuals are good. Cinematography and story telling was good also. But I think there are some lackings in Character development.. I would love to see if Ajak had more screenplay. I really like her acting. Ikaris played a interesting role. Overall, I enjoyed it very much. Must watch movie for the marvel lovers."
2711,1,"I guess it's all over? Idk even know what to say. It just isn't good. I had very little expectations for anything Marvel/Disney since Endgame, so my hopes and dreams didn't rest on this movie. It just wasn't good. It was boring, and I didn't care about any of it. I tried. I really did. But it just couldn't muster enough for me to be engaged. No matter how low my expectations were."
2712,3,"Visuals were stunning - the movie was NOT Only reason why I'm giving this movie 3 stars is because of the visuals & the actors gave it their best shot at a horrible storyline. This is not a movie for young kids. Not at all. Hollywood, especially Disney has lost their way on making amazing movies for the whole family that are entertaining. Characters were flat. Movie was way too long. It was just bad & weird at the same time."
2713,10,"Not your typical MCU movie, but it was great and I loved it! Eternals is a great introductory movie for the phase 4 of the MCU. It had the right amount of actions sequence and explanation necessary to understand everything that is going on, especially taking into account the amount of new characters introduced! Yes, it is not your typical fast paced, action-packed movie; but it was also never slow, instead it keeps you enhanced and expectant the whole time! Did not feel the time. Also the visuals are amazing!!!"
2714,5,"The flashbacks should've been the entire plot Out of the three MCU movies that came out this year, Eternals is the first one I felt like reviewing. Black Widow and Shang Chi were fine, but honestly, there wasn't much to say about them. With Eternals, I have a lot to say.As the title in my review states, Eternals would've been a lot better if the entire plot was like the flashbacks. Showing the Eternals living in different time periods seems like a unique concept that they could've done a lot with. With that format, I can see Eternals working as a good Disney+ show.In terms of structure, you could have the characters arrive at Earth in the beginning of the show, then split off after their mission ends. Then, the rest of the series would follow their episodic adventures in the past with each episode following a different Eternal in a different time period. For instance, one episode could've followed Sersai in ancient Egypt, while another episode could've followed Ikaris in the Roman Empire. Then, the end of the show could take place in the present, with an event that reunites all of the Eternals and sets up a second season.Another aspect of Eternals that could've been improved is the number of Eternals. Ten characters are way too much. Reduce the Eternals to five members, so each character gets more time to be developed. Personally, the characters I'd keep are Sersai, Ikaris, Sprite, Kingo, and Druig. I'd also get rid of that weird subplot where Sprite has a crush on Ikaris.Overall, Eternals would've been more interesting if it was a Disney+ show that showed the Eternals living in different time periods. Instead of following the standard MCU formula, Eternals could've provided something unique to the superhero genre. I give Eternals a 5/10."
2715,8,"It's a good movie May be not an execeptionnal movies but it's a good entertainment. The visual is amazing. The introduction of many characters is a success.Overall, I find this movies excellent."
2716,8,"The Eternals are Great!!! Honestly, I don't know how this movie could be less than a 6, I can understand if you think the pacing is slow and there was too little action, but for me it was paced well, the characters were great, the cinematography was great, everything was great! The only thing I would say is they could of use the deviant villain a little more but other than that it's a 9!!! Definitely top 10 marvel movie for me!! Oh, it's the most beautiful marvel movie imo!!!!"
2717,10,"Enjoyed A little slow at the beginning but it revs up. I found myself wrapped up in the plot and actually caring about and drawn to the characters. Amazing cinematography and special effects, deeply philosophical at times yet sprinkled with humor."
2718,9,"It's just a well made film, plain & simple. Yes, they do throw a lot at you, and the first hour is quick with the flashbacks and establishing the characters. But once they get cooking I really enjoyed this film, and will probably enjoy it more when I see it again. This is a new style of superhero movies so I really don't see why it's getting poor ratings. Really enjoyed it."
2719,1,Astonishingly Awful This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. There was ZERO character development and a completely pointless plot. What were they even fighting cause those cgi snake-dogs were ridiculous. I struggled to stay awake and it was only the frigid temperature in the theater that stifled that. And the acting was just over-the-top saved only by some of the moments with Kumail that were funny. Almost three hours of torture...save your money and go watch ANYTHING else!
2720,5,"The last words in the end credit scene were better than the entire Eternals movie This movie sucked. I love Marvel movies but this one was just lame in almost every sense. Dialogue was CRINGE. It was an hour longer than it should have been. This movie was so freaking boring we thought about leaving 30 min before the end. Full of plot holes. So draggy, lacking pace and tension. Character development was not believable at all. All the characters spoke like they were written by a 14 year old. Worst Marvel movie I've seen so far. End credit scene was the best part."
2721,1,"Boring and long This is without a doubt the most boring and overly long MCU movie out yet! There must be paid reviews on this because I know for a fact it's not in anyway higher than a 6. This should have been released on Disney+ as a original movie under the Marvel's tab instead of a theatrical release. At its 2½ runtime it is about an hour too long! It is boring as soo unnecessary. All of the ""superheros"" were weak and make you wonder why they even exist when there are other more capable hero's (and Gods even like Thor) who actually show up to do work and save humanity. This is a cash grab and a boring one at that! Just wait for this to come to Disney+, you'll be glad you did!"
2722,9,"A must see The MCU needed a fresh spin and Eternals delivers. The movie is fun and has its share of both serious and funny moments. In classic MCU fashion, it also sets in place several seeds for future projects. The cast is fantastic. The writing and directing are solid."
2723,10,"A success I enjoyed the characters. Which links to my main point. Where Zach Snyder failed with BvS and Justice League, Chloe Zhao succeeded with introducing a large cast in a super hero movie. By the end I knew a lot about each of the characters. I wasn't lost by the plot. I knew the stakes and why each character made their decisions. . There were no Deus Ex Machinas. Compared to the usual gimmicks from the likes of Snyder, Abrams, and Johnson."
2724,4,"It has its moments but overall falls flat First things, first I should warn anyone before watching this movie that yes it does have scenes of an LGBT family. Ignoring this issue that may divide audiences, the movie in itself was not bad but falls completely short of the MCU standard.The visuals and effects are on parr with some of the the other MCU but The whole movie seems to move in slow motion and is quite boring at times. Mixed in all this slowness, the movie filps back in forth between past and present, but will spend several minutes in one time period where I would often forget that this is not the present timeline and that there is just an enormous amount of backstory and exposition. There's some interesting twists but interactions between characters are mostly bland.I think part of the problem is that there were too many characters trying to compete for character development and I ended up not caring for any of them, just hoping the celestials would kill them off so we have the next big bad guy for the MCU. The movie is unique and has some cool moments but I think even the characters in this movie lack an identity to the point you'll probably forget half of them the next morning."
2725,9,"A greatly presented message I believe Eternal's one of the better marvel movies in terms of overall quality. The visuals are undisputedly gorgeous, and the music was notably good too. While the plot did have some minor setbacks, I don't see a clearer way the director/writer could have conveyed such a complicated project in one sitting. Some would say the movie is too long, but I think the movie is too short for what it had to cover. Eternals had great character evolution, and the lengthy duration was necessary. Some Marvel hero's require 3 movies see near the same development.I don't think a true impartial review is what this movie has been receiving. Many Marvel films with much higher reviews can't be enjoyed without a grand context, and this one works as a stand alone. Eternal is slower paced, more dynamic and has less action than the average Marvel film. Perhaps that attributes to the lower rated reviews among the other controversial inserts. However a slower paced movie that sacrifices mindless action scenes for plot development shouldn't be disgraced.Lastly, I think that the disparities represented was heartwarming and were realistic occurrences within the story. Same-sex relationships shouldn't matter conceptually speaking and the being in question doesn't reproduce. The point of the movie was to love another without pointless conflict. The ban of this movie in countries gives awareness to unjustifiable discrimination as if they were programmed to believe that way. This just so happens to be the message Eternals is trying illuminate!!"
2726,8,"A different way of storytelling I'm not a movie critic, so I'll keep the review short.I can see why ETERNALS is not an MCU favorite--it starts slow, and the flashbacks are confusing at time. Yes, there's also the lack of character development. But if you watch the entire movie, it leaves you wanting more somehow. You can see how it all fits together, even if some parts are lacking. It leaves you with this sense of satisfaction, a unique one that cannot be compared to either of the INFINITY WAR or ENDGAME, but a satisfaction nonetheless. And if the sexuality is what's bothering you, then shame on you.I expected it to feel like an eternity, and it did--yet, somehow that eternity was well spent, and I want to watch again. And that's what MCU movies do."
2727,1,"Garbage This movie was a complete and total waist of time. The story was confusing, the character development was terrible. This was hands down the worst mcu movie. This made captain marvel look good."
2728,9,"A breath of fresh air for the MCU but not perfect One of the best things about this movie is the gorgeous cinematography. I feel like what helped in this department was how you can tell they always tried to film on location instead of in a studio so they could easily get natural lighting instead of needing to use studio lighting. I feel like we all need to thank Chole Zhao, who directed and co-wrote this movie, for choosing to film on location and giving us that great cinematography. Chole Zhao also did a great job bringing her unique directing style to the MCU which helped make this movie stand out from the others with it not following the beat-for-beat Marvel formula. This is easily one of the most original Marvel movies to date so far but I will say that despite that the story for this movie is lacking. This movie is very much a more character-driven story in comparison to the other Marvel movies that are action-driven and because of that I just never felt myself getting fully hooked. Not to say the characters are bad when in reality it's far from that but I was always waiting for the story to speed up. I feel like my biggest issue wasn't the story but the pacing and how unfortunately it affected the story. This entire movie felt like the first part of a two-part series where it was building up the characters before a big fight in the next movie so when the ending happened, I was surprised. The best way to explain the pacing of this movie is up until the ending the movie is slow but once the ending happens it goes at the right speed. I will say that the action scenes in this movie were really well done and felt like something we haven't seen yet in the MCU. Another big surprise for me was the special effects in this movie and just how they looked pretty well done throughout the entire movie. The characters in this movie definitely weren't the worst part of this movie since despite the story not fully giving them much all of the actors gave it they're all in this movie. My personal favourite actor in this movie was Lia McHugh, who plays Sprite, because despite being so young in this movie, she still was able to bring real emotions to her character both serious and comedic. I also really enjoyed Lauren Ridloff, who plays Makkari. The final thing I want to mention is the score, composed by Ramin Djawadi, for this movie. I enjoyed that he didn't just keep it as one type of music style but also included other styles from different cultures. In the end, Eternals is a breath of fresh air for the MCU that still has some problems but doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film."
2729,10,Awesome Movie Great acting by all actors. Amazing visuals and really cool action sequences. The storyline is also really good and worth watching. I enjoyed the movie throughout. The credit scenes were also spectacular and shocking. Kingo and makkari's characters are really enjoyable and the story of Ikaris and Sersi is great.
2730,9,"Best Marvel movie in Phase 4 till now Give me the Boys vibe, love it. Don't listen to what people say, go in the theater and watch it. IN 3D!GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO!!And also the TWO AFTER CREDITS are MIND-BLOWING...Don't think I'm biased, I've watched every Marvel movies and comics, at least 5 times each."
2731,7,"A new journey for the MCU, need more. After 10 years of character driven movies, I just watched my first story building MCU movie that put the narrative over the characters. I enjoyed Eternals, but not because it was fun and action packed.My first thoughts coming out of the theater were: 1) This movie needs even more story building, character backgrounds felt glossed over, making them feel hollow and one-dimensional. Not enough time given to any single one to connect with. Oddly enough, the one I found most interesting was Druig. I loved that he can control people and his center was to end conflict, never anything self-serving. And introducing his love arc with Makkari was frustrating because it's another of many stories, we didn't get enough background on to really connect.2) Wasn't much fun to watch. The jokes and personalities were lost in building up the cosmic narrative. I did love the story and found myself reconciling the trade-off as not only a cosmic origin story, origin of Celestials and Eternals, but the new overarching phases leading up to Cersi's trial. It's going to be Epic! I hope.3) I loved the one deviant that was absorbing powers and consequently, becoming a viable enemy. It's too bad it was only one, and also lost out to the internal conflict within the Eternals.4) WTF is with no Avengers to be found anywhere??! They're all there when Aliens attacked New York, they ALL on holiday now? As integral they are to the MCU, even if not front and center for the new MCU phases, not including them is a misstep.5) Again, want more time with characters. To explore Thena's memories and past battles could be epic! I need more Druig and Makkari.6) The think I liked most about this movie was it separated itself as something of higher storytelling, extraordinary entities beyond what we've ever seen in the MCU, and does excite me for more from the story arc. Hope they don't abandon it to the likes of other movies."
2732,7,"Almost there Eternal was a pretty good movie, with great and unexpected twists, in addition to incredible action scenes. However, the movie fell short with its full roster, struggling to develop some of the core characters and demonstrate their usefulness. All In all, an above average movie. 7/10."
2733,8,"Emotional, human, and epic. Chloé Zhao breaths fresh air into this brave franchise and its embraced need to evolve Chloé Zhao is phenomenal; Her take of the Eternals is human and grounded and sentimental...She breathed life into the movie, and the result was a dynamic emotional epic, that was beautifully slow at the right moments, magnifying its characters, making them warm and important. And i think she had achieved the difficult task of interweaving an original style with this huge franchise.I think Eternals stand as a prime example of why Marvel is so successful, and why they are just better than what many perceive them, and how a pragmatic success is best made when the artist is at the core, as is the case here.I believe the critical views of this particular picture are mostly biased, somewhat superficial, and are stemming from some serious insecurities.Watch the Eternals, its a genuine beauty, a poignant picture, and another triumph of its world."
2734,8,"Actually Really Good I can see how some people found it slow at some parts, but I found it all well-paced and the dialogue and character development important in those scenes. There were so many twists and turns that surprised me and I felt the weightiness on the characters as they had to make hard decisions.I wouldn't label it better than other Marvel movies (especially recent ones), but it's definitely an important and enjoyable journey!"
2735,5,Snoozer..literally I've been invested in the MCU right from the start and although allovies haven't been great...they were decent and enjoyable. I've never fallen asleep watching an MCU film but with this one I did. I was confused by what was going on and there was too much side love stuff going on to hold my interest. As a start to the next chapter of the MCU it doesn't give me much hope.
2736,2,"Lousy movie from a second-rate comic book. The Eternals comic book published in the 1970s was cancelled after 19 below average issues. In the 1960s Jack Kirby was credited as an artist but also developed Marvel Comics' characters and storylines in partnership with Stan Lee. By the 1970s Kirby wanted total control as writer, artist and editor for his newest ideas. Without oversight, Kirby weakness as a writer was his Achilles heel. His The Eternals, deriving ideas from Chariots of the Gods and 2001:A Space Odyssey, created a pantheon of Super-gods (Celestials) and the super-human Eternals and Deviants. The story didn't make much sense then, and it still doesn't even now.The film does little to sort out the nonsense. Major characters are missing (Zuras), and the others don't resemble the comics version. The Uni-mind should blow us away but instead it underwhelms. The sets look cheap, the script and acting are embarrassing. There is really nothing to enjoy in this painfully long film."
2737,1,"Seriously this sucks Nevermind the MCU. This movie is horrible. Horrible story. When you reach for your phone during a movie cause you're thinking of something else instead of the movie you just paid to see, what else do you need to know?"
2738,3,"Eternals REVIEW - NO SPOILERS Isn't it a lot of character development for a movie? Eternals is an exceptionally beautiful Film that tries to live up to the great expectations of a massive action epic, but is mostly let down by a bright but unstable cast of enigmatic characters who try to pass it off as thematic with emotional depth. The magnitude of Eternals is unlike anything I've seen in the MCU so far, but it also results in a film that just has too much on its plate. While I admire the MCU for taking a chance by offering an ambitious and unique narrative, the script and storytelling just did not live up to the film's ambitious ideals."
2739,9,Didn't love it but it's still really Good I'm always on top of things when it comes to marvel comics and film or any marvel content but when I first saw the trailer I had mixed opinions then marvel put out the final trailer I was hyped for it and this film surprised me it didn't disappoint the story is very well written each character gets their own characters arc but it could've been expressed more but overall each character is good the action is really good they treated Makkari with respect unlike Quicksilver but other than that each and every moment of the film is just very good. The Acting is well put out there everyone played their roll pretty well including the actor for makkari she was fun but yeah this film is worth watching it doesn't disappoint 8.8/10 definitely TOP 10 MCU.
2740,8,"Not bad at all... Don't know what the heck all the ruckus is about... It was a well directed Marvel movie, nothing bad than that. My son and I enjoyed it for sure, despite all the ruckus over the 2 scenes that were there for a reason. Not gonna blow up about it, but all in all it was good. This team of superheroes was badass to watch. Can't wait to see more in the near future. Would recommend to those who are major Marvel fans but knows why this was changed in some ways unlike the comics are."
2741,8,"Unexpectedly entertaining With movies such as ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"" gracing the catalogue of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it's a wonder to me that ""Eternals"" is the MCU motion picture that has the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score. However, before watching ""Eternals,"" I wasn't surprised - super hero fatigue is the newest disease that seems to be infecting the public. All of that said, imagine my genuine shock when the credits rolled and I found myself actually having enjoyed this movie quite a bit. ""Eternals"" isn't perfect, but its genuinely exciting action, intriguing narrative, and shocking surprises make for a super hero movie that, while not breaking the mold, doesn't fit perfectly into it.""Eternals"" starts strong with an action sequence taking place in the year 5000 B. C. Featuring our titular heroes, the Eternals are shown fighting monsters known as the Deviants. The Eternals' powers are depicted in all their spectacular glory, and while many of them are similar to specific DC counterparts (The Flash and Superman will come immediately to mind), it doesn't make this sequence, and their powers, any less exciting. The Eternals aren't afraid to slice, dice, and otherwise demolish the Deviants, which can make for some brutal fights, especially for a Marvel movie. However, one thing that can and will manage to put a damper on your enjoyment of this film's action is the fact that many of the sequences take place in dimly lit, nighttime environments. No doubt an attempt to save money on computer generated images, this stylistic decision makes many action scenes difficult to comprehend - as you can imagine, this is particularly infuriating because, after all, ""Eternals"" is an action film.That said, even if I had to strain my eyes to decipher the onscreen happenings, I found myself enjoying the action scenes as a whole because, well, I started to really take a liking to many of the characters. Yes, ""Eternals"", which is no doubt a long film, does contain the trademarked Marvel mediocre dialogue and rushed characterization. So I'm not sure if it was the charisma of the actors and actresses or what, but I began to truly find myself entertained by the Eternals and their interactions with one another. Richard Madden as Ikaris and Lia McHugh as Sprite were the two standouts for me; usually I dislike child actors in films, but Lia was very good playing an immortal super hero who so desperately wants to live a normal life. Richard Madden's Ikaris was immediately likable - headstrong and cocky when he wants to be, and resilient and steadfast when he must, Ikaris brought some genuine surprises in this film, especially in the last act. Most of the other actors were good as well, but unfortunately, underutilized. Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek play small, but pivotal roles in this movie; they are both top tier actresses, so I was really hoping they'd play a bigger part. Barry Keoghan as Druig is also a show stealer, with one scene in particular featuring him being my favorite of the entire film.The story that ""Eternals"" decides to tell may not be the freshest, but the way it is told is certainly unique. Featuring scenes that take place in both modern day and in the past, ""Eternals"" feels like a sprawling adventure. Chloé Zhao's directing adds a stylistic flair that is much needed, especially when compared to the other fairly flat looking Marvel movies. She is also unafraid to tell this story by shocking the audience; I found the twists and turns to be very unexpected - I won't spoil them in this review, but let's just say the formulaic CGI boss battle that most super hero movies employ isn't necessarily the direction that Zhao decides to take this story.Honestly, I'm slightly shocked by how poorly received this film has been. When compared to other films in the MCU, ""Eternals"" is, in my opinion, one of the better ones. Much less predictable and formulaic, this film's unique story and entertaining characters makes for an enjoyable super hero experience."
2742,5,"It was ok As a comic book movie fan, i am willing to admit that this wasn't the best movie. It was very rough to get through and DEFINITELY shouldn't be 2h40m this movie could be 2 hours and wouldn't change much except for better pacing, i kept checking the time because at time i just wanted it to be done . If you're a marvel fan i would just recommend waiting for it to get on Disney plus or if you can get cheap tickets. Fight scenes were very marvel, interpret that as you will. It wasn't complete horrible as the final fight was very fun to watch, Gilgamesh and Kingo were very funny and i loved every scene they were in. I'm not mad i watched it, i would just not do it again."
2743,6,"Not the worst, not the best. This film makes me appreciate Endgame a bit more. Endgame showed audiences that a bunch of heroes could share the screen as long as we cared about them and they had their own point and purpose. Eternals attempts to do the same, but in it's 2 and a half hour runtime they don't manage to give their heroes enough character development, beyond the droning exposition, to equal The Avengers. The end result is a cinematic version of the old saying, ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". The plot and pacing are quite convoluted at times, and I, as well as many other MCU fans are growing wise and weary of these ""Everything is at stake, and yet nothing is really at stake"" plot lines. The acting and direction were great. Cinematography was great. But we've seen these action sequences done a lot better. We've seen these villains better done in the Hellboy franchise. The music of this film was not iconic. In the end, I was bored. My butt was sore from all that sitting, and I left the theater not really caring about what I had just watched. Most marvel films see me out of the cinema with a smile on my face, eagerly discussing what I just witnessed. Not this time, sadly."
2744,4,"Marvel: Let's try to see how sucking feels like So marvel hated success and decided to try how sucking feels!!Two hours and half that can be told in 15 minutes, no deep characters personalities in most of the characters.At least give them powers like the avengers, imagine one of the heroes creates illusions and and the other manipulates everyone minds except the enemies they are fighting, and the third has fast healing only!! So why anyone will send those to save anybody?!The most powerful three of the eternals are as follows: a mentally disturbed lady, the actual villain, and wait for it, no, they killed third in the middle of the movieI was literally feeling like i am watching a low budget sci fi movie, it's not a marvel movie, no chills no funny parts, no surprise."
2745,7,"MARVEL BIGGEST RISK Eternals was great . They don't know what they're talking about. Eternals is probably Marvel biggest risk because it's a original story. Did I enjoy it? Hell yeah. Was it okay perfect? No. Eternals is beautiful in its own way. Chloe Zhao is once again showing her potential as a filmmaker. It's was fantastically filmed. I seen it in IMAX which is the way any movie should be viewed. The IMAX parts was out of the world literally 😂. The way she handled the film it really had me falling for these characters. She did a wonderful job. Films stars Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, and the main person in this flim Gemma Chan. Also Manny more. Gemma was great she really grown on me from start to finish. Richard Madden was ok I never seen his films before he good I would like to see him in more films. Kumail was the funniest one in this film but the only part is the one part with the Indian movie filming that was kinda cringy as a person with Indian background I think marvel should give it another try. Salma Hayek I love her films it's great. Was she a right choice for this role. I did you could have gotten someone a little more flexible meaning someone with the knowledge of Superhero films. But she did good with what she had. Lastly Angelina Jolie she was surprising. I thought she would give an lazy perform but she got me wrong. One of the best characters In this entire flim."
2746,10,"A Great, New Beginning Very great movie entering the MCU. I'm verts surprised on all the hate it's getting. The movie is very entertaining and full of surprises. The storyline was great and will be very important to the MCU as time moves forward."
2747,10,"Good start I just don't get it how can be possible some people rate 1 to this movie, as a fan of marvel, this was an amazing movie and a good start for the phase 4, don't read the bad negative feedback, just watch and take your opinion, you'll not regret it."
2748,8,"Probably fits too much in 156minutes - but still very good I guess it's easier to compel yourself to post online when you don't like something, but I think this is one of the occasions where the fact the film is very good deserves comment, given a lot of the bizarre pre release negativity.I won't go into too much detail, but it does have a huge time frame to try to give some depth to, as well as introduce a high number of new characters throughout the film.AS ALWAYS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO WAIT FOR THE POST CREDITS END SCENE. Regardless of what you think of the rest of the movie.I did think the initial pace was slow, but found the film flew by after the first hour."
2749,9,"In Marvel We Trust I know the critics and audiences are sharply divided over this film, but you should listen to the fans, and as a True Believer I can tell you this movie is fantastic.I honestly think it was absolutely awesome and quite innovating for a cinematic universe with more than twenty-two movies in their catalog.The characters are alien in nature, but they display a large range of human emotions. Besides, the casting is magnificent and the direction is just beautifully paced.It is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it does not deserve the hate it gets.Please never trust the critics' consensus, they do not have your best interests at heart."
2750,9,"People are wrong, this movie is amazing! Not only was the film beautiful to watch, it combined history and the reunion of a ragtag group, two things I love. This film doesn't cater to the cis-white-straight man like the majority of the Marvel movies and THAT IS A GOOD THING! It has this calming energy for an action film, a great balance attained by Chloé Zhao."
2751,9,A very different Marvel movie but I loved it! Idk why it has mixed review this much. I enjoyed it thoroughly. One of the best cinematography I've seen in a while. For sure the best Marvel cinematography. Isnt it weird that everyone complains that all Marvel movies are the same but once they make it different everyone has to fuss about it.
2752,9,"The beginning of the end... A lot to unpack with Superheroes that are not very known to mainstream audience. MCU is absolutely going in the right direction on the more cosmic scale of the Marvel Universe. Just like the Guardians of the Galaxy, not many knew about them. Now we have a great origin story, created by the Legendary Jack Kirby, that will seed all things cosmic! Great story telling, humor, action, and special effects."
2753,9,"Beautiful Film!!! This movie was incredible. I had some issues with script. Specifically, it was a lot of characters in a short amount of time so I feel no character got the amount of screen time they deserved for development. Having said that, the plot moves at a good pace. Visuals are freaking BEAUTIFUL! Chloe Zhao has done an amazing job with this film! Highly recommend!!"
2754,6,"A total mess!!! But kind of won me over in the end!!! Well here is another MCU film. One that has gotten some pretty negative reviews before it came out. I am not a believer in the internet determining my opinion on a film but it definitely can affect my expectations. I knew virtually nothing about Eternals. Not a fan of the comic so this was my first exposure to the story and characters.Eternals is about a group of immortal beings with superhuman powers that have lived on earth among us for thousands of years. Supposedly they are on earth to defend humanity against The Deviants. Their evil counterparts. The film is very much like The Avengers in that it tries to give most of the characters their moments. It is a big cast so I won't go into each characters but there are some standouts. Gemma Chan plays Sersi. Another chatacter that liked was Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos. He us an inventor that is supposedly responsible for some inventions that he regrets such as the Atomic Bomb. The other characters are ok but one of the films weaknesses is that like most MCU films is that some characters seem to be in the film for comic relief. In the first hour I was not into the film. I was think that it may definitely be the worst Marvel film I've seen. It felt slow and even though there was really high stakes in the story it seemed too jokey to take seriously. It even felt like a spoof at times. One other thing s the film goes back and forth in time to tells it's story. Between present day and thousands of years in the past. This style of storytelling works for me at times but here it was distracting. The film is directed by Chloé Zhao. A highly celebrated director of last year's Best Picture Nomadland. She has a great visual style and even though the action scenes are well done, they aren't much better than most MCU films. The difference here is that there are some heavier themes she deals with in the film. The problem is that it us so jokey at times that it diminished the more serious themes. This film is being sold as a very different take on a comic book film in the MCU. I do agree that it is a little different it pretty much like most other of the MCU films. It's not different enough but it dies try to distinguish itself at times.I'm glad to say that it wasn't the bomb that some were saying it was but I would say it's hit and miss. But it did grow on me a bit in the end.Grade: C+"
2755,1,"Not a MARVEL MOVIE A ten??? Really? Compared to what? No way. Giving this a ten has got to be people who own stock in Disney or are blinded by the visuals or ""artistry"".I get it. It's nice to have superheroes that have observable differences that individuals can relate to and how anyone can be a hero. That doesn't make a movie great. Visual ""stunningness"" doesn't make a movie great. To be a 10, the movie has to get everything right. This movie misses on many fronts.The superpower eternals are weak. Tony Stark alone is more powerfulThere are big issues in logic. THENA slices a super charged baddie to pieces yet all times prior there is minimal damage. Ikaris has laser eyes that sometimes kill. They try to use shotguns to kill with?Supposedly no interference with mankind but we see throughout they help mankind with mankind knowing they are godlike and their names. They wear their uniforms in plain view?Very slow developing. Plenty of spots to go get popcorn and not miss anything.Unnecessary scenes. The flashbacks are unneeded, mostly. The romance of Ikaris and Serci is overdone. The amount of time explaining things to Serci is too long. Some fight scenes are too long.The cgi isn't great. Mostly for Thena.Visually stunning didn't cross my mind. Clearly the eye of the beholder.Humor is there, but limited. Action is there, but limited. The light saber battles in the original trilogy are as good as found here. Not in terms of visual stunning, but as interesting in context. That is, the action here, is nothing special.This is NOT a Marvel movie. It is a movie made by Marvel with Marvel-created characters.Save your money. Go to dinner instead."
2756,8,"A Rich Marvel Comic's Fan Fest A film I never thought I'd ever see happen, the Eternals! And what a fantastically refreshing Marvel film at that. It's nice to explore some of the more interesting and varied characters from the comics for once. I enjoyed that we explored so much history, viewing Earth from a very different perspective than other MCU films, refreshing for sure . In many ways this feels like essential viewing for the hardcore marvel fans.I can't really understand the bad reviews either, Jolie puts in one of the performances of her career. Her screen presence has never been better. Chan is fantastic, so is Madden. The sets are beautiful, the CGI is as good as it gets on screen. My one criticism would be that I figured out a major twist very early on, without even trying I should add. It was a little obvious because of some of the dialogue, at least to me personally.I enjoyed some of the subtle history nods. Some are quite obvious and I would hope everyone more or less knows what is what. Others a re a little smarter and I imagine most viewers won't catch it. It'd perhaps not best aimed at children this time, personally I think it's refreshing. There is still humour but it doesn't gift you all the information. Sometimes that makes for a better film and it does here.I definitely wouldn't listen to the negative reviews. If you love sci-fi you'll love this. If you love history, this is your film. Lastly, even if you just love cinema, you'll enjoy this. It's epic and grand and I can't wait to see more of this story."
2757,10,"One of the best Marvel films to date! This movie was outstanding, the acting was 10/10, the movie was shot beautifully with great fight scenes, a fantastic story (probably the best story so far) with a huge everlasting impact on the MCU!I do not understand why this mobie is being hated on, it is probabpy due to these charavter being new, not many people (other than comic book fans) will recognise them. Before watching the trailers and the movie, I never knew who these characters were, yet, I still believe that each of these characters are some of the greatest characters in the MCU, bringing a much too needed change to the universe. I believe fans need to stop fixating on Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they are dead now, and fans will have to deal with that fact.The whole LGBTQ+ 'contraversy' is nothing, the kiss in the film was totally justifiable given the life or death situation, and shouldn't even be an issue to begin with!There is also no culture or diversity properganda shoved down our throats!!!There is soo much I can write that is good about this film, there are a few 'nitpicks', but overall, this is a fantastic movie, the cast, directors and staff should all be extremely proud of themselves for giving us such a beautiful masterpiece!"
2758,4,"Really bad... so, so sad. This was probably the worst film in the history of the MCU. About an hour too long for the story if not more. While discussing with friends trying to find something redeemable about the movie we all decided that the one redeeming thing was the trailers before the movie. I think that with the thought of a multiverse coming in the near future, the Eternals story is a good fit, but the execution this time around was just plain sad. I was legitimately bored the entire time. I did sit forward in my seat once or twice in expectation of something good, but that something never came..."
2759,10,Awesome Movie If your a fan of the MCU or a fan of the comics this movie is very enjoyable. Visually it's amazing and there was a lot to pack into the film but I thought they did a good job. There is still so many Marvel characters we haven't met yet on film and this is just the beginning of the story. I loved it.
2760,4,Felt like an eternity.. Ok i have never fallen asleep during ANY Marvel movie until i saw eternals.. Sooo long with lack of action and too much sappy dialog. Also you kill off the hottest character first! But at least Jon Snow got to be reunited with his cousin Rob Stark. And he still knows nothing!!
2761,8,"Don't let the bad reviews fool you, this is a great film! Going into this I tried to keep my expectations to a bare minimum, though the bad reviews I kept seeing didn't help. I knew nothing of the characters, the plot, anything. Basically the only thing I knew I got from the trailer.This isn't your typical marvel flick with mostly light hearted tones and the more serious stuff glanced over, this is a mostly serious film in my eyes, and I love it. Yes, you still get the jokes but it leans into the darker tones way more than you'd expect. We got a hint of this in Infinity War too, but here it is way better.Now let's address some typical points in the bad press this has gotten. One of those is that there's bad CGI, which like, did we watch the same film? Did I notice it? Of course, there's aliens made of purple string, how could I not. But it wasn't distracting nor immersion breaking in any way. The film also didn't fall into the typical trope of large CGI marvel fight ending. Was there a fight? Yes. But it wasn't the ""let's fight thousands of faceless monsters"" type of fight. It was a personal struggle between characters you got to know through the film, and got me several times emotional.Overall, I'd say give this film a go (as if you weren't to already). Just please, don't trust the bad reviews."
2762,10,"A more serious Marvel movie I really liked this Marvel movie, it is really different from the other ones. Every character is well explained and in the end I couldn't even decide which one is my favorite. They are all unique and interesting.The action sequences were very well done and the cinematography was phenomenal.My rating is not actually a 10/10, it had some minor flaws, the rithm was sometimes too slow, but as an experience in the theater, it was just marvellous! I hope you can experience what I experienced!"
2763,8,"Unexpectidly refreshing I was hearing everywhere about how bad this movie is, and expected just that, until I saw it. Personally, I was getting tired of marvel movies and at last this one is a different experience. Impressive visual effects, beautiful shots and a different style in general. Still, far from perfect but at least a pleasant surprise. After all, is it that bad that marvel bacame a bit daring?I give this movie an 8 not because I belive it really deserves it but because sadly is very underrated. I hope we will get more movies like this one in the future ."
2764,4,Disappointed A 15 minute sitcom episode was stretched to a 2 hour yawn fest.I haven't been so embarrassed in front of my friends who came to the movies on my assurances that a Marvel movie and A-list star cast would never disappoint.
2765,1,"Fell asleep Don't waste your money or time. Marvel has gone downhill after EndGame. Eternals was slow, graphically unimpressive and poorly acted. Didn't mix with any other marvel movie."
2766,9,"Smartest Marvel Movie Yet Not your typical Marvel movie at all, you have to think, you have to have to be familiar with other cultures, world history, and classical philosophical arguments. I can see where many critics suffered with this one, although they usually just rate something they don't understand highly so they don't look stupid.Marvel movies give you the unexpected and this one is on a completely different level. I can't wait to watch it again and I can't wait to see these characters interact with those from other movies."
2767,4,"Disappointing MCU film The new MCU film introduces us to the Eternals, a group I knew absolutely nothing about going in... as well as a few other characters that pop up.. one of whom I was more familiar with. This is an interesting film, that opens up a bunch of new storylines for future films.. but the film itself... I feel like it was a bit of a misfire.. which is very rare for Marvel... the film contains a lot of world building stuff to set up the Eternals storyline which requires an awful lot of flashbacks and back story... which hampers the forward momentum of the main story... The cast is decent, Gemma Chan does most of the heavy lifting.. but they really waste Angelina Jolie and especially Salma Hayek in the film. It gets better in the last act but sadly this might be the weakest Marvel film since the MCU started."
2768,10,"Might not be for everyone but it was right up my alley! Eternals is Epic!Stan Lee believed that comics are the myths of the modern age. Eternals delivers on this potential more than any superhero movie in the recent history. It is grand in scale, absolutely stunning visually, progressively cast and humanely told.It has melodrama in spades, but in a similar way the best X-men movies used to have. Each and every character is interesting and sufficiently nuanced.The action is clean and satisfying.The abilities are somewhat archetypal and simplistic but are represented with such gusto that every use of them is pure geeky joy.This is probably the most dramatically satisfying movie in the Marvel catalogue to date. Up there with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and the Holland Spider-Man Movies.It is long and somewhat slowpaced.Jokes are as always might seem to some to be misplaced.... The movie is TRULY diverse in its cast. In many ways that might annoy a certain type of movie goer/comics reader. But the diversity is not the point. It just makes the characters sooo much more real. Which is a good thing.... TLDR: Illiad + Xmen + Justice League Animated Series = 10 out of 10 for Eternals."
2769,2,"The Eternals message is shocking The message of this Eternals film is actually quite shocking, when you consider the comics backstory, in which the Celestial Arishem became envious and tried to murder the Celestial Tiamut to steal his power. Tiamut fought him off, but before Tiamut could warn the other Celestials of Arishem's treachery, Arishem got to them first with false accusations against Tiamut, and persuaded some of them to attack Tiamut in a gang.After their combined power defeated Tiamut, they ripped out his soul and imprisoned it in ""a vial"", then persuaded the Swarm to devour Tiamut's physical form. Then the Evil Arishem used the power he had stolen from Tiamut to enslave the Celestials who had helped him.Now in this Eternals movie, the Evil Arishem persuades the awakened Eternals to attack Tiamut before his soul can escape and emerge in a new physical form. So millions of viewers are being tricked into cheering on as the Benevolent Celestial Tiamut is murdered and destroyed yet again by the Evil Celestial Arishem, who even kidnaps some of the Eternals who helped him, while Arishem continues to masquerade as a ""Judge"".It is the Depraved Arishem who should be destroyed in the sequel, and Tiamut the Benevolent Dreaming Celestial rescued."
2770,1,"Insufferable Nothing witty, memorable or causing you to cheer. Just CGI, a plot that doesn't even attempt to tempt you to suspend disbelief and a disappointing, giant Celestial transformer."
2771,10,"WAKE UP! New Era is here and I LIKE it! Everything changes so does MCU.Its truly slower than most of the MCU films, but gave us a whole new direction and atmosphere with a brand new crew.Loved the whole squad. In 2.5 hours we got quite complex characters. Yes its not easy to follow, yet still understandable. I suppose everyone can found an eternal to indentify with.As for me dune was much slower especially as a franchise kick off..I got the vibe, the future is here."
2772,10,Fabulous Don't wait for it Go go go with your friends and family It was fabulous movie Akshay sir you nailed it.... And tip tip barsha pani. Was serprise in the movie.
2773,1,"ABSOLUTE DOG TRASH I don't know where to start. This film is awful. I feel sorry for the actors in this film. I feel like they were set up to fail, the film had promise phase four excited me until now. However, I do not believe the following films will be as bad if they change director and seriously boost some more comedy and down to earth acting they earned in previous films.Stupid pointless plots with random cut scenes and not enough action. Lacked character drive and decent acting, big cast but lacked the punch."
2774,4,Expected much more .. Went in the cinema with the feeling that this is gonna be the best Marvel movie in recent time.Left dissapointed and wondering is it actually even worth going to the cinema to see Marvel movies anymore .. It would be far better if the money spent for this movie was spent on Dune sequels if you ask me.
2775,9,"Very good movie and start of something new I nearly didn't come because of the reviews. It's really good, it's just not linked to the old marvel movies and is starting something new. Give a chance."
2776,1,"Momentals Eternals?! It is waste of the time to think about this movie more than one moment. Everything in this movie is between bad ,worse and worst. Marvel chose the ancient superhero to bring new kind of story lines. But when there was not innovation.it would be the results."
2777,10,Way more than just another marvel movie. All I can say is that movie critics are just proving how out of ouch they are based off there reviews. We clearly were watching two different films. All I can say is go see it because it absolutely is worth the watch.
2778,6,"Absolutely poor What a waste of nearly 3 hours, no sense of direction.. the film was literally pointless!Poor script, carried by a good cast.. other than that it's a complete waste of time.Barry Keoghan was great throughout!Genuinely disappointed after such a long wait."
2779,5,"Not great. The movie has some great visuals and some good action scenes but the acting is severely lacking. Only Richard Madden in this movie shows any form of skilled acting with believable emotions in the more intimate and emotional scenes. Even on the big screen, I thought the movie failed to deliver a noteworthy impact. Not a great Marvel movie."
2780,7,"This Film lasts for an Eternity Marvel's latest entry to the MCU feels very self contained, and allow for Chloe Zhao to work with a large budget using her beautiful affinity for landscapes and nature at a large scale. The films story, plot, characters, and performances are all phenomenal the only issue with it is there's too much, and it's our first time with any of these people. For a film like ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" which also contains a lot but we've seen them before and the stakes are quite low it's an easier ride. With this film, it's the first time many of these actors, characters, writers, and filmmakers have entered the MCU and while it's without a doubt thrilling and fun, the movie feels it's length and can leave some unfamiliar with the Eternals feeling bored (however I was ecstatic.) I'm excited to see where these characters go in the future and I hope Chloe Zhao is invited back to the table to tell another chapter, as I feel she has some ownership over these characters much like James Gunn to the Guardians. I almost wish the film were told in two parts as it is very similar to Dune in some ways, but take what we can get. Is this the worst of the MCU not by a long shot and it's crazy to see the Rotten score after viewing it, but I can't say I don't understand where some are coming from. If you're a fan of Marvel and are ready for some new characters, Shang-Chi might have been more your speed, but Eternals satisfies in ways that are very beautiful and deserve to be seen."
2781,8,"Something new, entertaining and refreshing Eternals was amazing. The visuals were beautiful, the costuming was beautiful, the soundtrack was great, the fighting was great. They did a good job at tying the past and present together. The comedy in it was also fantastic. It can be hard to understand what's going on in some bits but other than that it's defiantly worth a watch."
2782,10,Great movie Critics are full of it. Movie was fantastic. One of the best movies I have seen in years. Would watch it again. And again. Acting effects and cgi were increfible.
2783,6,"An overstuffed movie Eternals is an overstuffed movie that fails to thoroughly focus on any of its ideas. Recognition is deserved because it touches on some interesting themes and provides light twists that break the ironclad Marvel mold. However, these themes are diluted by a cluttered story, and the twists (though uncommon for Marvel) are fairly standard for films overall. So, while Eternals has some relatively ambitious attempts, it still falls into classic pitfalls of franchise movies.The most fundamental flaw of Eternals is its unclear intentions. Is it creating a cohesive experience, or is it merely a stepping stone to expand a franchise? When the main protagonist (Gemma Chan) has neither characteristics nor an arc, the narrative at hand feels like an afterthought. Meanwhile, side characters are superfluous, the villain lacks pay off, and the tone/pacing are erratic. Furthermore, the themes of Eternals aren't fully explored. Ideas of autonomy, utilitarianism, and consciousness are introduced but, disappointingly, go nowhere. This lack of follow through applies to the filmmaking as well. Eternals has occasional visuals but is bogged down by CGI barf and bloated action. Ultimately, the movie reaches for respectable goals but fails to commit to a specific direction.Writing: 5/10 Direction: 6/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Acting: 7/10 Editing: 4/10 Sound: 6/10 Score/Soundtrack: 6/10 Production Design: 7/10 Casting: 7/10 Effects: 7/10Overall Score: 6.1/10."
2784,8,"It's not rotten A visually stunning , technically brilliant and strongly written movie . Afcours it has its fair share of flaws but definitely better than the reviews .The director Chloe tried her best to develop the 10 eternals during the short span of the movie so it's a slow paced one and minimalistic stunts justify the whole nature of the film ' not an action packed super hero movie ' which might have disappointed the fans .As a conclusion it's a big scale drama and slightly phylosophical movie who's characters happens to be super heros...."
2785,8,"Story is a nice change for Marvel Marvel fan here but knew very little about this IP. Like every Marvel film the visuals were great. I loved learning about these new characters, I love the stakes in this film were greater than most Marvel films. If you want a popcorn film you will be disappointed as there are no faceless armies and the sky beams are minimal. This is a character driven movie and does the best it can to flesh out this large essemble. This makes me excited for whats next. I felt the jumping back and forth in the timeline of the movie (ie. 4000 bc, present day, 350 AD, present day, 2500 BC) was a bit too much but doesnt take away from my enjoyment."
2786,1,"2.5 hours i will never get back Terrible movie, first time I almost walked out of the cinema since ""Be Cool"" (the sequel to get shorty.) but my wife stopped me. No plot and awful script which made decent actors seem terrible. (With the exception of Salma Hayek, who was good) The characters were of no substance. Of course they whole movie was dictated by the current woke situation and meant that each token minority was crammed in there without a thought. Sad times indeed."
2787,5,"You cannot please everyone The franchise since endgame has stagnated or declined. It could be due to lack of movies being released because Covid might have slowed any momentum it had. It could be nothing feels very authentic anymore, just crowd pleasing or politically correct. I don't know for sure. All I know is, as of right now, the franchise feels more like Star Wars. The originals were great. Everything else either was lacking or just being put out to make money out of its relation to the universe. Not worth the expensive movie tickets to see. If you support Disney monthly/yearly then just wait to see it on the app."
2788,1,"Disgusting! Marvel must get rid off this lame formula: CHESSY JOKES EVERY 5 MINUTES in every freaking of their movies! I always heard/read craps like: ""Marvel is better than DC"" ""Marvel rules"" ""MCU is better than DCEU"" Ummmmm..better at what??? At making money from kids and silly adults, of course! The way Marvel is praised by so many people..make me lose the faith in humanity! 95% of Marvel movies are terrible, childish! And they say DC/DCEU suck? DCEU make one of the best superheroes movies, fact! I liked Logan so much, i liked old Hulks so much, but that's it! This new movie: Eternals is nothing new! The same crap, the same formula: Cringe jokes, cheesy and dumb jokes! The Deviants are not even closed to the ones we see in comics! The movie is a big pile of..... NOTHING! One star for some good special effects!! Don't spend your money and wait to see it online! Now, come one, marvel fan girls who praise everything from Marvel, give me ""thumbs down"" to my opinion, i don't give a spit!"
2789,8,"Doesn't deserve the bashing I'll be honest, I had alot of expectations built for this movie for quiet some time and once i saw it for myself i personally don't think it deserves all of the bashing its receiving. One of the most mentioned problems being the slow pacing is quiet justified though, but even in the endgame we received that pace until the moment started to build up after most of the movie. Although it's definitely not on the same wavelength as Endgame, its not half bad as well.Cinematically it felt surreal but simultaneously quiet real, wonderful job on that. More the reason why it should definitely be viewed on the big screen. However I personally think that the point where the movie lacked was in the last half hour. The whole stopping the emerging scene couldn't quiet live up to the hype it built for us but again I think it's just a mere part of the story that's going to continue in the upcoming phase.To conclude this, I liked the movie. It was like a refresher from the prior movies we've scene. Still I'd say this again, doesn't deserve the heavily negative reviews it's receiving but again it's just my opinion. Solid 8 from me, -2 for the let down regarding the ending scenes."
2790,5,"It felt like a summarized version of a TV series This movie has two main challenges that it needs to overcome: introducing a brand new cast of main characters and setting them within the context of the MCU's Post-Endgame era. The last MCU movie that had to deal with similar challenges was Guardians of The Galaxy. However, while GOTG only had to introduce 5 main characters, The Eternals has to introduce 6-10 (depending on how many of the Eternals you consider to be part of the central team). Moreover, while GOTG could avoid most of the existing MCU context (post Avengers 1) because its setting was in deep space, The Eternals takes place on Earth and must address the recent MCU events. Overcoming these two challenges in a satisfying way for the viewers is incredibly difficult, so I have some sympathy for director Chloe Zhao for how lackluster this movie felt. What annoys me is that The Eternals wants to do so much more while already having a pretty full plate.The first half felt like a collection of key scenes taken from a 10-episodes TV series. A TV episode can build a connected and complete mini-story in 45-60 minutes on 1 or 2 characters and their relationships with the world around them. This allows a TV show to flesh out more, if not all, of its main characters. A movie does not have such luxury, so the typical solution is to focus on only a few characters and leave the rest with some surface-level development. But this movie isn't willing to sacrifice, choosing instead to give each Eternal a personal conflict to overcome. This results in none of the characters having enough screentime to properly go through their arc and allowing viewers to be invested in them. Like watching only the introductions and highlights of a TV show, you may find the scenes interesting, but they don't deliver any major impacts. Combining this with the movie's frequent switching between past and present and you get a jarring, frustrating, and eventually boring experience. The second half does have some interesting revelations and resolutions, but by that point I'm only watching to see how the MCU will be expanded and not to see how the characters can overcome adversities anymore.I'm kinda sad about how this movie turns out, as I had hope that it wasn't as bad as critics have said. And to be fair, the movie tries to tackle many interesting ideas: dementia, sacrifice some for the sake of many, duty vs. Love, allowing people to make their own choices vs. Living their lives for them, and more. But it got too ambitious while disregarding its limitations and, like Icarus, fell into the ground. So in this one case, I agree with the critics--this movie is a 5 for me.On a side note, this movie has the best visual effects out of all MCU movies. From the technogies of the Eternals to the appearance of the Celestials, it all looks incredible and outer-worldly. With the MCU expanding to the realms of cosmic entities and the multiverse, I look forward to what spectaculars are awaiting (looking at you, Dr. Strange)."
2791,9,"Weaving a new story into MCU future I did not grow up reading Eternals so all that I have learned has been via looking them up online. Putting a new phase into an established MCU timeline is not easy yet this movie did quite a lot with the 2.5 hours we are given. New characters are introduced, fresh stories are put out there and the fans have something new to delve into.I enjoyed this movie and the direction we are now going. It is building new paths, giving us new adventures with amazing scenarios, stories and conflicts."
2792,2,"Not Your Normal Marvel Movie If you're looking for a BORING superhero movie with no real sense of danger and TO MANY main characters... this is for you!!You don't need to worry about story or substance because it's written in a way that allows each character to take turns either giving a ""1 liner gotcha comment"" or setting up the next character to have a quick ""1 liner"".Do you want to take a nap? Watch the first 15-20 minutes, and wake up for the last 15 minutes and you'll feel like it was money well spent."
2793,10,"OMG!!! Mind blowing Amazing Movie!!! May Be To Deep For The Average Marvel Movie Fan Who Never Followed The Comic Books & Lazy Thinkers. I must say I was extremely worried it wouldn't be good but BOOOOY!! Was I wrong, I put it like this if your a Die Heart marvel fan I mean comic books and movies you will LOOOOOOOOVE IT, will freak you out big time only if you follow the comic books, if your only into the marvel movies and not the comic books I would see how you wouldn't like it will come off everywhere understandably but I follow the comic books so I got everything I mean everything I love the mid credit and the end credit was amazing hearing the guy voice who will play the new blade asking him "" you sure you wanna do that and there was so many Easter eggs and settle parallels like Angelina Jolie The character she is playing standing next to the Statue of herself please forgive me I just got out the movie theater so my mind is extremely racing right now but the director of the movie Chloé Zhao I feel did a mind blowing crazy great job by staying true to the comic book adaptation and putting a more modern take on it but I also believe that also takes away from the movie as well because in today's modern society a lot of people ain't trying to really think during a movie they want boom pow right there in there face it had no dry part to me had the right amount of comedy not over bearing the only part that really was a lil risky to me was the pg13 love making scene and the dudes kissing not my thing in a marvel movie only because it wasn't in any other marvel movie the inner conflict within each character was amazingly executed and Chloé executed the whole family dynamic from love to sadness to hurt to betrayal to overcoming adversity to self awareness and freedom of one self and the most important part sacrifice in the consequences behind it and the power of human bonds through sample interactions. It will be a part 2 and I can't wait and fyi the way the commercials could trade the characters in the movie and then when you see the movie you would be like I didn't expect that I thought this person would be the one to turn but it was this person omg wow."
2794,9,"Blown away, (it's not what people say it is at all) I like movies that make me think, keep me guessing, have real stakes and suspense, and great characters. This had all of that. I don't know what the negative reciews are banging on about as a lot of the stuff they say is in there (a long passionate gay kiss? Nope, just a normal kiss like a spouse sending a husband off to war...no tongue, no head movement, no repositioning of the lips, no passion, just a kiss and it's done) and the film did change the formula up, but in really good ways that made me so excited because I couldn't guess what would happen. Definitely lots of jokes and action, too. It's in my Top 5 Marvel for sure. See it and make your own judgement."
2795,10,got me on the edge of my seat Loved the movie from start to end. Could feel with characters. Loved the action scenes. A big shoutout to the speedster.The devianst are cool made and offer challenge. Angelina jolie shines as always.The CGI was like i'm used to with marvel movies.For sure going to watch this movie again.
2796,8,"Why are the reviews so bad?! This was really good! Look, I know it's not perfect. There are some messy moments and plot points that don't quiet work... but I really liked this movie.I like that it takes its time to build up the characters and their relationship with each other. I love the more serious tone and and themes. I love how it's shot. For Marvel's lowest rated movie, I though it had a lot more good than bad in it.I surprisingly liked the characters a lot. I've seen some complain that there's too many of them, but I though it did a great job at balancing all of them. They were all memorable in their own way.I just don't see why THIS is the movie that made critic so disappointed. It's really not bad at all."
2797,1,"Completely forgettable An uninspired and completely forgettable movie that the MCU would be better without. Save your time and money. If this sorry cash grab didn't have the 'Marvel' tag on it, it would be gone in a week. Let's hope that the 'The Eternals will return...' banner at the end of this movie is just a sick joke and that the studio hires someone who can properly vet a screenplay."
2798,10,"Risk taken, but definitely a great addition to the MCU Before this movie was released, people were already slamming and critiquing Eternals, without any knowledge about this movie, its plot and the background of the characters played. The bad ratings came, not surprisingly, from people who thought characters with a diverse profile shouldn't be portraited as such. Which is a shame, cause I was really looking forward to this movie.After seeing it, I can say without a doubt that this is one of the best Phase 4 films so far. The dialogue between the actors was powerful and often times gave me a smile. Some people might say it was dragging, but hey, it's not an 'Avengers' film with non stop action. Chloé Zhao took a huge risk with the storytelling, different key elements, the intimate scenes and the different actors, but honestly, I loved every single minute of it.The two post credit scenes give the future of the MCU a lot of potential. Kit Harington as a potential Black Knight and, with Harry Styles playing Eros, a logical link to the next Thor or GOTG movie. Excited for what's coming next!"
2799,2,"MCU without its fundamental aspect When they said this movie is unlike any other Marvel movie, I was like ""Sure, I can accept different"", but after seeing the movie I understood what it actually meant. It lacked one fundamental thing that all other MCU movies (and even superhero movies in general) had in the past - ""Characterization"". It had the potential to truly break new grounds in comic book storytelling but instead got crushed under the weight of the inter connected nature of MCU. Should have been a dualogy or a Disney+ mini series. Apart from the spectacular visual presentation, this shockingly dull and uninspired tale of immortal beings coming together to save the world is a least interesting version of the Justice League and Avengers movies."
2800,6,"Its not bad but its not good I feel like it was way too long for what it's trying to be. Too much crammed into it, way too much exposition. The visuals and acting was good, the action was whatever. Celestials were cool though. Interested in seeing where these characters end up."
2801,8,"Solid start to a new title in the MCU I really enjoyed Eternals. Gorgeous cinematography, and a great ensemble cast. I look forward to seeing how they develop these characters and how they'll integrate into the wider MCU."
2802,8,"Different but good I really don't know why critics don't like this movie. OK, its not the classic Marvel movie but it adds depth to the whole marvel cinematic universe and its really enjoyable to watch. The visuals are really good, the jokes are fine but there are only 3 action scenes, which is no problem at all."
2803,10,"Marvel does it again! This was an amazing movie, it is defiantly more complex than previous Marvel movies, which I can sympathize with simple-minded critics rating the movie badly because their concept for the standard Marvel movie recipe was challenged. The movie was full of great comedy, heart-pounding action scenes, stunning visual effects, and most importantly, a lot of heart. To tackle 11 new heroes in one movie is an achievement in itself, let alone the character development and history in just a short period of time.Marvel once again achieved an incredible movie. They made me care about a group of heroes I knew little about and had me cheering them on with intense emotional energy at the final conflict of the movie."
2804,3,"I Really Wanted To Love It... I've had high hopes about this movie for years. While I was watching it I was trying to talk myself into enjoying it... but in the end I it felt like a HUGE swing and a miss. I felt like I didn't really know the characters, or care for them. The first two acts were choppy. The final act was (and what lead to the conclusion) was all just to convenient and felt un-earned. I really wanted to love this movie... but I didn't."
2805,5,"Slow, predictable and wooden acting Sorry.Such a disappointment.Nothing like the caliber of the other Marvel movies. Mot even in the same league.Slow, predictable plot with some seriously questionable casting.Special effects were, of course, great and the locations were awesome.Just didn't make up for the long, boring dialogues and lack of excitement."
2806,10,"Fantastic storytelling and a great sensory experience. Eternals was simply awesome. I left the theatre wanting more. It's a must-watch.Zhao's direction and Djawadi's music together created something magical, something unlike any Marvel movie before it.The representation, which I feared would be forced or flat, felt so natural and fitting for the story being told. It was refreshing. I'd honestly give it a 9.5/10. I wish we had a full-length 3 hour piece (like Endgame) which would have allowed the final third to play out at a better pace. I'd love to watch the developed director's cut if it ever came out.I'm glad I was excited and pumped for this movie and managed to ignore all the critics (most of which doesn't even make sense now) and the review-bombing."
2807,4,"Why not a miniseries?! Some of the themes here are great, inviting some grand philosophical questions. However, most of the running time get way to self-righteous and plodding, despite some great examples of filmmaking.Certain scenes are beautifully shot, the music is sometimes good and the actors are mostly fine.Ultimately, as a movie, it feels empty and vacuous. They would have done better making it a miniseries, exploring more questions and pumping up the entertainment value.The critics were spot on..."
2808,5,"Yeah ok Is it your normal marvel no..is that a bad thing no.I liked it to be fair..it's a bit long I agree.. The characters I liked. The action I liked.I think what was missing is some or any connection to the bigger MCU..not a dealbreaker though but beyond a few mentions of Thanos that's it...the Thanos issue is an issue as is some of the other villains in the MCU purely from the standpoint of the eternals apparently can't intervene though harp on about loving earth..it just makes no senseOverall I liked it though, good action, solid story."
2809,10,"One of the top three MCU movies ever. Can't wait for sequel. This movie had everything. The story telling, the action sequences, the comic relief, the character development, the bond between certain characters, the emotions, the twists. This and every other thing expected from a MCU movie. You could not have asked for a better way to begin phase 4.The acting was also great. Screenplay was almost perfect. The cinematography was amazing. I just didn't want the movie to end. Absolute gem of a movie. What I loved the most was that every character was given a fair amount of screen time to showcase their character development and abilities. The duels were top notch. First half was great and second half was even better. Hope we have a sequel and soon. ""Remember"""
2810,6,"One of the worst MCU instalments I start positive it looks phenomenal every visual detail is perfect. Humour was extremely good I laughed out loud on multiple occasions. Acting was very good no complaints there.Now here we go, please don't kill me marvel fans. I am one of you.I just think that the story telling was bad. I like the premise of the core storyline with emergence and the Ikaris turning out to be the cause of Ajaks death all that I enjoyed BUT the execution of everything else was bad.They tried to do way too much. Each character was treated like a main character which means they tried to develop 10 characters in a matter of 2.5 hours. It doesn't work, doing that doesn't allow for us to appreciate and become invested in the characters. Them not developing the characters enough made for emotional scenes that weren't actually emotional. It also made for weird executions of each characters storylines. For example Thena has roughly 15 min where she is the focus and then another 10 min to rap up her character plot line, that doesn't work we don't actually care because we only spent 20-30min with the character.Next up is the timeline. Whoever decided it would be a good idea to constantly change time periods shouldn't get another writing job. It was so bad. It was unbelievably confusing and gave us character information for characters we weren't even introduced to yet. It doesn't make sense.For the sake of length I won't say much more than that. I could pick each character apart but I don't think an IMDB review needs that.Eternals 6/10."
2811,7,"Great I was really confused by the bad reviews this film was getting. Now that I watched it I'm mad. I don't know what you guys saw, but for me it had it all. It was fun, it had great action sequences and really compelling characters.I'm not a marvel fan, but this one is different and I think that's why I liked it.Chloe Zhao left her mark, and it was phenomenal."
2812,7,"Great I was really confused with the bad reviews this film was getting. Now I'm mad because it is a great movie! I don't know what film you guys are watching because the one I saw has it all. It is fun, great action sequences and tense moments. I just couldn't stop watching.I'm not a marvel fan, but I can say this one is fantastic.Chloe Zhao left her mark, and it was phenomenal."
2813,8,"A cosmic superhero family! Eternals was a breath of fresh air in the MCU. There was a large ensemble cast so I never expected all of the characters to achieve the same amount of development but it was nice to see such an inclusive cast where gender, ethnicity and sexuality received representation without it being forced into the story.The time spent following the lives of the Eternals raises many philosophical and existential issues which shows the true colours of the protagonists. They are a family unit and it was interesting to watch the emotional weight behind their decision making. They all had their own views and motivations which made this more than just a good Vs evil movie.The movie features a lot of exposition which can take up too much screentime at moments. This, I think is where the movie suffers from a mixed pace. It's difficult to show alot of the information that is needed when this movie features a lot of cosmic lore. It tries its best to show visuals with exposition at least.The action and music was really exciting in this movie and it was fun to watch the Eternals use their powers in different ways. The conflict in the final act felt personal to each of them and so I was emotionally invested in how it would come to a conclusion.Overall, I think Eternals gave us an original story with the usual superhero tropes we've come to love making it new but familiar!"
2814,10,"One of the greatest MCU-Movies in my opinion Actors / Dialogues / Story / LogicBackground of the story and parts of the movie story (Attention: SPOILER!)The Eternals were created millions of years ago by the Celestials to help implement the Celestials' ""plan"" in the universe. Celestials are implanted into the planet's core as a symbiote when new planets are created. The Eternals are then given the task of protecting life on the planets from the Deviants. These were also created by the Celestials, but were a ""failure"". Life on the planets must thrive, and when life reaches its peak, the Celestial awakens and devours the life or the entire planet. But this new Celestial creates again new suns and galaxies and makes the emergence of new life possible again. An eternal cycle, which lets the universe grow and keeps it alive. So far so ""reasonable"", if one looks at it from cosmic view. But since the birth of a Celestial extinguishes also the life of a whole planet, it is equally morally questionable from view of the already existing life to exchange existing life against possible life in the future. The Eternals are always on these planets as a group. Only the leaders know about the annihilation, all others are kept in the dark about it. These think the life of the planet simply needs to be protected from the Deviants. Once the Celestial is born, the Eternals return to the highest and first Celestial. There their memories are reset and the cycle begins again on another planet.The fact that you finally learn more about the universe, the cosmos, and the Celestials and the Eternals here is something I like extremely well. I like this topic ""cosmos"" just totally and find that more interesting than always only the ""little"" people on Earth. Even Thor with Asgard and Norse mythology immediately captivated me back then, as did Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Marvel.The Eternals in this film arrived on Earth 7,000 years ago to awaken just such a Celestial on Earth as well. But the leader of these Eternals, Ajak (Selma Hayek), has moral qualms and loves humans so much that she wants to prevent the birth of the Celestial. She lets Ikaris (Richard Madden) in on her plan and her remorse. But then Deviants reappear in the present after centuries, and they seem to have become more dangerous and intelligent than ever before. And so Ajak is killed by a Deviant and Eternal Sersi (Gemma Chan) is appointed by the supreme Celestial as her successor. When she learns of the plans about the Celestial and the destruction of Earth, it is terrifying to her in the greatest degree, as she loves humans above all else. And so the Eternals on Earth, who separated centuries ago to live among the humans unrecognized, come together again to discuss what to do. Not everyone agrees, and each Eternal also has problems and concerns all their own.The plot is actually quite logical in itself and I didn't notice any major logic errors. The story takes place in the present, but there are always flashbacks to the time between the arrival on Earth and the present. In this way, the audience gradually learns more and more about the Eternals and their peculiarities, their powers and their problems and worries. I really like that about the film. Not every one of the ten Eternals is given equal screentime. The focus is clearly on Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), but Sprite (Lia McHugh), Thena (Angeline Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Ajak (Salma Hayek) also get enough attention for the audience to learn enough about all of them and get emotionally involved with them. The characters are the first major strength of the film for me, as they go through an interesting and exciting development. Each of them has their own problems to deal with. Of course, there would have been more if the film had been given an even longer running time. But Chloé Zhao really got the maximum out of the 150 minutes of running time (without credits). Emotionally, however, the film took me away completely.All the characters are well cast and I find that they all play their roles credibly and wonderfully. The interaction between the actors and the Eternals as a team also works wonderfully. Each Eternal has his own idiosyncrasies, but still they harmonize well as a team, even if there are some differences among them.I like the dialogues in the film very much, because they rarely seem forced or inappropriate. The film takes itself seriously (more like Captain Amercia: Winter Soldier or Civil War) and at no point degenerates into a silly comedy like Thor: Ragnarok, Ant-Man, Spider-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. I read and heard in some reviews that Eternals, like Thor: Ragnarok, often comes across as way too silly and gags were squeezed into the most inappropriate moments and scenes. This is definitely NOT the case. I wonder if we saw the same movie or if some critics were daddling along. Overall, the film is one of the more serious representatives of the MCU. The humor has been interspersed decently and mostly very appropriately. Most of the humor comes from Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and his butler Karun (Harish Patel), and the humor lightens the seriousness a bit, but never as intrusive as in Thor: Ragnarok, for example, where even sad scenes were ruined by inappropriate and silly gags and jokes.A few words about the Eternals' superpowers: to me, the powers and the Eternals themselves reminded me most of the mutants of the X-Universe. Each Eternal has a special power or powers of his own. Ikaris, for example, can fire laser beams from his eyes and fly, while Ajak, for example, can heal himself and others quickly.The Deviants as enemies remain relatively pale, but I like the basic idea that the Deviants have also undergone an evolution and feel betrayed by the Celestials. Unfortunately, not enough is made of this theme, which is why the Deviants never get beyond the usual Marvel enemy image. Unfortunately, some potential was wasted here.One could also question why, for example, Doctor Strange never appears on the scene and helps the Eternals, since he is also as powerful as they are and protects the Earth from cosmic forces. The fact that he doesn't notice anything that happens in the present is very questionable. The same goes for Captain Marvel. It's logical that Thor can't show up, because he flew off with the Guardians of the Galaxy.Setting / CostumesThe settings change between Orient, jungle, European forest, coasts, space, lowlands and cities and are very varied. Also time wise there are scenes between 5.000 BC and today.The costumes are not bad either. Each Eternal has its own style and I really like that.CGI animations / action scenesThe action scenes are relatively rare, but then they really have it going on. The CGI quality is on a high level and the overview in the action scenes is always given. There is no shaky camera and no extremely fast cuts. As a viewer, you always keep a good overview of the action. The final battle is fortunately also exuberantly long and sprawling CGI battle with an overkill of action fireworks, but it is short and crisp. That's the way I like it, because there's nothing more tiring for me than drawn-out action sequences with endless and fast cuts. This is where Eternals absolutely stands out in a positive way.Camera / Scenery / EditingI really liked the camera work. Often the viewer gets to see grandiose wide shots, which also always gives you a good overview of many scenes. There are also many landscape shots from the air and great panoramic images to see. The editing of the film did not strike me negatively, here everything fit well. Long scenes and quiet shots are normal here and I really like that.MusicThe music is rather subtle and the sounds have actually always pleased me quite well, even if here now also only little has stuck. Epochal pieces of music that stick with me as in ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""Interstellar"", you look here in vain. But I really liked that the music of the first trailer (""The End of the World"") also appeared in the film, even if unfortunately only once. That immediately gave me goose bumps. Great surprise!ConclusionEternals is in my eyes one of the best movies of the entire MCU so far. It offers an exciting story and finally puts the focus on the Celestials and the Eternals and explains a lot about the cosmic forces of the universe. The focus is clearly on the ten Eternals, their character development over 7,000 years and the dialogues. Almost every character gets enough screentime and room to develop. Eternals is also one of the more serious representatives of the MCU and the humor is discreetly and appropriately interspersed and silly jokes or sayings never come at an inappropriate time (casting evil glances at Thor: Ragnarok). The action scenes are short but crisply staged and the cuts and also the camera shots are really great and provide a good overview of the action. The central theme of the film is a lot of moral issues about ""right"" and ""wrong"" and that it is just not always so easy to draw a clear line between the boundaries.The running time of 157 minutes is not too long either, provided you can get used to the calmer style of the film and the focus on dialogues and character development and don't expect non-stop action. For me, at least, there were no tough stretches and boredom never set in. Eternals totally picked me up emotionally and took me on a great journey for 157 minutes. Even today, a day later, I'm still thinking a lot about the film, and in a positive way. I definitely want to see the movie a second time in the theater!Despite the minor weaknesses, however, I am so incredibly satisfied with the film that I award it the highest score. It's rare that films sweep me away with such extreme intensity.10/10 points - High rewatch value."
2815,3,"Spectacular but disappointing Eternal starts off with a really promising setting of events and characters with just the right degree mystery. But as Zhao tries to develop them it's soon falls short of expectations that it itself puts forward. The visuals of heroes and monsters but specially of the different locations, historic events and people are magnificently achieved and beautiful to behold. However there's not much more there and certainly not enough to save this delivery. The film soon gets too slow, too long, too filled, a little mixed up, and unbearably pretentious. Characters are just too many to convincingly develop but at trying, it sacrifices steady structure and splats the tone all over the place. As the final act approaches characters and plot go completely adrift with something of a childish randomness hurry feeling to it. At the end it shows that what felt like a thought-thru promise of epicness never really knew where it was headed."
2816,3,"Commits the greatest cinema sin of being outright boring! I ignored reviews, even when I heard it was nothing like other marvel movies I honestly became far more excited as the marvel tried and trusted formula has become a little tiresome to me.What I wasn't expecting tho is for it to be so unforgivably boring, somehow even the action scenes are dull. You get the odd bit of beautiful cinematography yet some shots even in the same scene are shot in imax where others aren't and it can be incredibly jarring. The acting is hit and miss but mostly miss, Angelina Jolie should have remained retired.Save your money and wait till it's released to stream."
2817,1,"Marvel Fail I went into this looking for the next great marvel movie. 10 minutes in and i was already disappointed. Almost three hours later i completed the worst comic book adaptation movie i have ever seen (and yes ive watched the travesty that DC has been putting out the last few years.) by the end of the movie there was not one character that i cared about. Kit, Angelina, and Richard gave the worst performances of their careers. The plot(s) were asinine. The only thing going for it was some great CGI Scenery. Remove the characters and add an epic soundtrack (also lacking) and just show scenery there might be something there."
2818,8,"Waited 2 years for this movie, and it did not disappoint Man, I've waited long enough to watch this movie, and all I can say is the critics can suck it. I was nervous as h*** before watching it after the reading the reviews, but from now on I will have to stop taking their opinion into account. There were maybe four scenes with a gay superhero and suddenly it's a movie that is all about LGTBQ??? It was a mature and realistic look at what superheroes would be in the current time. I left wanting more, and I'd love to see Zhao, and renowned directors like her continue creating superhero movies.. Even if the MCU hasn't had a movie better than the Dark Night, they are definitely going in the right direction. As kids that started the journey with the MCU back with Iron Man, we deserve the MCU to keep maturing along with us with more movies like this."
2819,8,"Don't listen to the haters This movie wasn't boring, it was fairly easy to follow if you're a marvel fan (maybe less so for casual fans), it was visually appealing, and had fun sci-fi elements. Maybe because I saw the bad reviews ahead of time I was ready to be let down and never was so I came out of it really enjoying it. Judge for yourself and ignore the haters."
2820,8,"Huge MCU fan Great Watch! My Dad was a huge comic book guy growing up, has a wide collection spanning the decades. He knows a great deal about the comics & the characters therein, he enjoys this universe of films as much as I & he is always able to explain certain characters & plot summaries to me in difference to their portrayal in the films. The negative reviews for this movie & others I've seen throughout the 13 year period of this MCU, are disheartening, to watch marvel entertainment is to appreciate it & at just 20 years young, I can't wait to see what the future holds! Excited to see the remaining Eternals in the future of the MCU, however & whenever that may be!"
2821,1,"Great CGI If this was a silent film maybe it would have been ok... No on second thought the plot points were asinine the characters were very one dimensional. There are a number of great actors that i think gave the worst performance of their careers (Angelina, Kit, and Richard) a week ago i would have said that Marvel cant make a bad movie. Now i have to say even the DC movies are better than this garbage."
2822,7,"Good but slow It's a different kind of Marvel movie to the ones we are used to, however, it is not one of the best but also not one of the worst.The special effects are great and the interpretations are good, but I think the story could have been told in less time, many scenes are just irrelevant to the plot and make the movie innecesarily longer.It is not a bad movie considering it as a new start, but if Marvel wants to keep their audience happy and satisfied they have a lot of work to do."
2823,1,"It's a mess Compiling bunch of name actors and throwing them into a movie with total mess, boring conversations and weak story, no the visuals won't help out. One of the worst marvel productions (join the DC bad movies)."
2824,8,Very good I loved this movie. The cinematography was brilliant and the action sequences.This is definitely worth a watch in imax like me and my friend didOverall: 9/10.
2825,4,A bit long and slow A ton of back story. Lots of flash backs in random spots. The eternals don't seem as powerful as they should be. End credits scenes were okay. Last one was my favorite part of the movie.Ends with a lot to be desired.There isn't really a clear villain in this movie. I guess that's what makes it different.Still has entertaining moments. Honestly you could wait for streaming to watch this.
2826,1,"De gustibus non est disputandum. For me, this movie made me cringe so often it felt like an attack of epilepsy.What I like about every other Marvel movie is the continuity and how well all the pieces add up to a bigger and better story. This festering turd has no internal logic and haphazardly introduces many truly elements that are supposed to ""play out"" through Phase 4 in perhaps the stupidest ways possible.There are two main themes you might find in this mess of a movie: ""Are we safer and/or happier remembering the past?"" and ""Is humanity worth saving"" The MCU answers to those questions would make for a far far better story if this movie could be completely forgotten."
2827,10,"A new era of the MCU It's a lovingly written divulgence from Marvels usual formula and is all the better for it. A great addition to this next, transformative stage of the MCU. It is a great step towards a true representation of today's world, and not one found in comics in the 70s."
2828,7,"Being introduced to a new step sibling I am hyped for this expansion into the Marvel universe!Eternals introduces us to a new world within the world of Marvel. At first, the number of characters left me disengaged because I didn't know who these characters were personally.I found myself fighting to like these new characters; it felt like I was being introduced to a step-sibling, unlike the previous Marvel installments where most of the characters are known and graciously established into my heart.Unfortunately, the film doesn't seem to differentiate the characters enough for me to find them too enjoyable. Although they are very diverse, I found them progressive and not forced in ethnicity, personality traits, and identities.I liked the comical relief. The action scenes were intentional, forceful, and amusing as each character has unique combat. I also felt like I had a keen sense of catching plenty of Easter eggs and references to other universes like Star Wars.The climax action scene intensified at the perfect time, fuelling my imagination toward the idea of what was to come next left. I am geeked for what is to come next.Verdict: Eternals is an enjoyable film. It is introducing us to a whole new aspect of Marvel. Compared to some of the other marvel films **cough, cough Black Widow lol ** this fairs well. Some comedy flirts at love and sets us up for so much more to come.Does it take me to paradise? Marvel fans, I say yes!"
2829,10,"Better than ShangChi and Black Widow. I don't understand, all the hate this movie is receiving. I didn't expect much while going to watch the movie after seeing all the reviews, but it turned to be a awesome movie."
2830,3,"DECEIVING REVIEWS After checking mixed IMDB user reviews some bad but majority good, I decided to give ""Eternals"" a chance and watched it last night.Bottom line: It was as boring as a movie can get, The CGI and cinematography is beautifully made, nevertheless Eternals fails terrible on the story department. It's shockingly slow, tons of unnecessary dialog, corny one liners and encounters that don't progress the story nor make you care about the movie itself, or any of the many characters in it.I love Marvel as much as anybody but just because it's a Marvel movie it deserves a blind 10 star review like so many have done in here, This is a terrible adaption that leaves you not wanting more."
2831,1,"Disappointed I saw this film on its release date knowing nothing about it, and filled with expectations based on previously enjoyed MCU films.Unfortunately I lost interest early on, the narrative is fragmented and weak. Storytelling is without structure and characters are two dimensional and have no motivation for their actions. The film is filled with plot holes that are never filled, and as a viewer I felt no concern for the protagonists, eventually being apathetic about the whole thing.I just wanted it to end, it felt like double it's actual running time and it is utterly boring.The fine cast do their best with the inferior script, but there's nothing there to work with. It looks beautiful in cinematic terms, especially if you value pretentious art house, desaturated chic. Whether or not that's a suitable pallet for a story based on comic book superheroes is debatable.Just boring."
2832,1,"So bad until I fell asleep in the cinema It is the worst marvel movie I've watched before.No direction, nothing exciting. I don't even know what's the storyline. No good ending. Even kids don't enjoy it. No wow factor."
2833,10,"Amazing if your are an eternal fan!! Ignore the bad reviews. Being an eternal comic fan, watching this movie was a great experience. Yes it's long, yes it has it's dull moments but it's a very important storyline that needs time to be told. Cramming it up in an action packed nonsense that some other marvel movies are will not be justice to the amazing characters that eternals are. It's just the beginning and sets a perfect stage for the future sequels. Not a Chloe Zhao masterpiece but definitely stays real and honest to the epic comics that eternals is."
2834,8,"I really loved this film! But I see it has problems Firstly I just want to say this film is really well shot, acted and directed. However the story is a bit messy the first act is too fast the seconds a bit slow but it all comes together for the third which i really enjoyed. Several times in this film I just thought wow that looks amazing. I've seen alot of critics saying this film has no heart or life, this film has a heart and it is very much alive in every way. All of the characters are really intresting and none feel under developed.This film is getting so much uneeded hate yes it has problems but it's not one star worthy. The critics have been so vague about why they hate it some just saying it's too woke. Any form of diversity in this film is natural and not forced.Overall, If you're a marvel fan and want to go to the cinema this is a must see. If you're indifferent about it can wait for dinsey plus I love this film and is one of my favourite marvel films but I can fully see why some dislike it.My personalfan rating 9.5/10 more critical rating 8/10."
2835,1,"Bad Idea, bad script, don't repeat this again When you decide to enjoy superhero movie, don't consider this one at all. Disgrace to the superheroes movies we all love.It's like Angelina Jolie is doing this movie unwillingly, worse performance ever."
2836,8,"8/10 - A middle-tier MCU movie with a lot going for it I'm hard-pressed to find anything I actively disliked about this movie, and I'm quite pleased by some risks they took.Most notably for me, they kept things on a cosmic scale for most of the story, and this was not put off-balance by the terrestrial encounters with Deviants or warring humans, nor by the development of the characters.Some viewers found the characters underdeveloped, and while I largely disagree, I also laud the film for staying more focused on ideals, cosmic themes and other abstract ideas, rather than getting bogged down by modern pressures to individualize. In terms of how much distance we feel from the characters as the overarching story is told, this feels more like The Odyssey than your typical Marvel movie, and I see that as a strength. And don't forget: this is part of a franchise; if you want more development of a particular character, remember that future films are coming. But also, why not try perceiving your own life from a grander perspective? I hope this movie stretches the viewers to rethink their own sense of their role in history.Some viewers also blasted the film for pushing the maturity level of the content, and even as a moral conservative, I have to defend the filmmakers for this choice. This movie is part of a franchise, and so it makes sense for its installments to mature as its viewers mature. The Harry Potter franchise did the same thing.One more thing I appreciated: the final film had so much less comedy than the previews led me to fear. Telling a story spanning 7000 years should have a gravitas and solemnity to it. I believe it patronizes the viewer, for a filmmaker to believe we need weighty matters broken up by laughs. We are growing up. Our movies should too."
2837,8,"Better as a Movie than as a Marvel Movie The story of immortal beings tasked with protecting humans for a great (or devious?) purpose!I really did enjoy this! The visuals are stunning, the characters are interesting, and there is a good story to tell.However, it does not mesh overlay well with the established MCU in terms of tone and scale. Of the most recent three MCU movies, this is the best movie, but Shang-Chi was a better Marvel movie. The Eternals are slow paced, deliberate, and somber - not what is normally found in an MCU movies nowadays."
2838,10,Amazing Eternals is a must see. Everything about it is Beautiful and the comedy is some of the best in the mcu. Each character has a great story line and humor overall each character has very interesting powers that keeps you hooked on there story and there character in general. Like I said externals is a must see.
2839,7,"Good enough Reviews complain boring not realizing what the film is trying to pull off. While the audience is waiting heroes fighting monster in the face, some fine tuned plot is actually happening. The plots could be better, but is much more in depth than most marvels standalones, a Cilvil War scale event without any buildup. Character drama is the lesser side of Marvel; glad they are trying something here."
2840,9,"Visually epic, different from other MCU movies, philosophical, doesn't deserve this much low rating Gods among humans. This is a fictional story of gods sent down to earth to protect humans from deviants but is it this simple? Or there is something more to it. This philosophical movie deals with this scenario where gods are living among humans and how they help humanity to grow and how humanity made them to grow. Altogether an exciting movie to watch."
2841,10,"Eternals the best movie for the phase 4! Ok right of the bat, when the first trailer came out on eternals i just watched all the breakdown videos of the trailer and everyone was predicting that what was gonna happen in the movie and mostly everyone was on the same page but when i saw the movie i was extremely shocked i was like: wait what?? I was shocked i mean i really didn't saw that coming thing but guys seriously the visuals were soo good i never seen visuals like this in any marvel movie! It was truly a worth experience i don't care about the reviews like it really doesn't matter you should yourself go and watch it i can assure you that you won't be disappointed and i honestly didn't even felt for a single second any part of the movie boring! Chloé Zhao did an amazing job and the post-credit scene jesus christ! Was mind-blowing!!"
2842,7,Must watch but... It's a very good movie with amazing visuals and feels very different from regular Marvel which is a great thing but the ending feels rushed which is the only negative point.
2843,6,"CGI vs. CGI - yawn This movie was the last straw for me when it comes to watching cgi humans battle cgi creatures in a cgi landscape. There is no realism to the action. No stakes to the drama. It's cheap plastic entertainment. Thankfully, there were some human moments that shined through. Gemma Chan is lovely. The gay was fun. Sprite too. Richard Madden was a bit joyless. Angelina was stiff. (It would have been amazing if they cast an older actress as Thena - especially since she seemed to have alzheimers. Imagine Sharon Stone in the role - would have worked on many levels). Overall - this was too cumbersome and turgid a movie to have fun with. Like an Avengers movie that skipped the phase one set up and had to cram it all in in one movie."
2844,3,"Don't waste your time!!! This is the worst Marvel film. Thought it would be with all the hype and names involved. There were some good bits, but the film just went on and on trying to be profound and clever. (see any positive review) Shame as I think phase 4 will fail."
2845,8,"8/10 People hate this movie because it's different, and thats sad. For the first time ever i feel like ""FINALLY!!!"" A mcu movie that dont look exactly the same as the others. The cinematography IS AMAZING. The story is good but not bad. The ending is scare with the selestial in the sky. I wish tho mutants where in it, like a easter egg or something.To those who hate it: you are like a fart in the universe. This movie is good and it's different. Different is good. Different is the future."
2846,10,"Exquisite concept, eye feast I just loved the film man. Its osumm chole has a dynamic vision. Not as a marvel fan but the film has that potential its simply superb. But unluckily they havent used angelina as the main cjaracter but she is the powerful one though ppl felt it bad amd there is a gay kiss and a sec scene on marvel movie so ppl might not find that 5 to 10 seconds bad but shouldn't comsider only that and rate. Screenplay stiry music are highlight. I watched thrice twice yesterday and one time today in theatre. Just go for it. Superb film......"
2847,8,"Go see it Admittedly long, and i see how people may have problems with its pacing, but it wasn't an issue for me. It was different, good acting, good unforced jokes, diverse, visually stunning, and so much more. When theres so many important characters, it kind of becomes necessary to develop them with a long run time and this movie does that well. Action sequences are very entertaining. An all around good movie going experience. I highly recommend."
2848,3,"Oh no.......*face palm* This is going to be a biased review, plain and simple. Firstly I don't care about these (MCU) films anymore whatsoever, thought it would be better after ""Endgame"" to just stop the franchise. Why do they need to keep making films..............oh yeah for money.........my bad I just remembered. If I'm being honest I have been in the minority for a long time, the MCU to me is very hit and miss............although I never thought they could miss this poorly.Lets try and talk about some positives first. Let me think here Mmmm.......... Gemma Chan was trying very hard to at least give some resemblance of a good performance however with this script its almost impossible. She carried the film well and did standout so congrats to her, its not her fault this film is bad. Also Angelina Jolie......*sigh*......for years there have been rumours that she had turned down offers to appear in ""comic book"" films. This is the one that she picked! For me she is the best part of the film, which isn't saying much, however her performance throughout is good and her character is slightly interesting. She deserved a better film!!!The rest of the cast, I cant really remember. A few of them were really annoying and bland. Not very memorable whatsoever.Sadly though there is going to be a certain section of society that will hate this film regardless of seeing it or for its actual issues. I do like the very bold attempt and showing probably the most diverse cast of characters in a film I think I've seen period. Chloe Zhao and Kevin Feige should be applauded for doing this and hopefully with some luck this will become so normal that we won't have to talk about it or bring it up. The diversity of the film is not its problem !! For me its issues are far far worse then that!!Story!!! My god is this story bland, boring, unoriginal, overly complicated, cliche, laughable and just all over the place. I don't think I've seen many films from Marvel, under the Disney umbrella, that have been as messy as this one. From my point of view this film has too many characters and plot points going on for its own good. Introducing a lot of brand new information to the audience for the first time...........its a lot to take in. Sadly the film does not pull it off whatsoever!!To me this film is a brand new modern state of the art skyscraper but with the foundations of three old wooden chair legs. The film may look good from the outside, have a good cast and decent special effects however its (foundation) story and place in this universe does not make one bit of sense.Its obvious to me that they rushed this into production, its even more surprising considering the fact this film was delayed a year for covid. ""Eternals"" should have been split up into multiple films, that way the story and characters could have had more time to be fleshed out. However with a 2hr 30 min runtime, this film feels like an eternity already.30% out 100 this film is bad at its core. Two decent performances, some ok character interaction. However its surrounded by a dull, boring and unoriginal rushed story that is all over the place. If you loved this film great, good for you.........this film have major issues for me, its sadly though in 2021 not the thing thats gonna be talked about."
2849,8,The MCU movie you didn't know you wanted. I must say that as even the MCU known for taking bold swings with genres within the superhero genre this one might have been the boldest one yet. I had high expectations for this film and even though I had assumptions for it that were not met Chloe Zhao still managed to craft something that exceeded those expectations. Almost from the beginning the story is engrossing and very expansive to a level that even the Avengers films never attempted. The characters are well crafted and treated deferentially from the outset. I am sure everyone will have their own favorites but mine was definitely Angelina Jolie as Thena.If you leave all expectations at the door and just let the story before you unfold I believe this film is one that will definitely command rewatching again and again. There are also two post credit scenes with clearly outline the future of the MCU so be sure to stay and see.
2850,6,"A Decent Watch Not the worst Marvel movie surely. A decent watch. There are a lot of Marvel movies way worse than this. I liked the fact, it had a bit mature tone to it. They tuned down the comedy a bit. I liked that. Marvel movies were leaning towards too much unnecessary comedy. Great visuals. Good introduction to the galactic level threats.But it's just too many characters they're asking you to care for, in a short period of time. So, you end up not caring for most of them.Still, pretty enjoyable."
2851,6,"Just okay. I wanted to love this movie, I love the director, I love the idea of going further into space, and exploring God's and celestials, but this movie really felt like 2.5 hour exposition dump to set up the next phase of the MCU. I feel like some good stuff is here, but it doesn't quite come together for me."
2852,9,"Ten Rings Success Beautiful direction, cinematography is amazing! I love the underlying emphasis on family loyalty though one character is definitely misguided.The colors in the movie are brilliant and the story line and touches of humor are fabulous. , Though the movie is a tab bit too mystical in parts for my taste, all in all it's a great film."
2853,5,"MCU's First Misstep Eternals is not a bad movie for taking risks and trying something new in the MCU. Eternals is a mediocre superhero epic because the film does not fully commit to those risks. The film never truly reaches its true potential, instead it remains stuck in neutral for a 2 1/2 hour runtime."
2854,9,"Eternals.....it's refreshingly different! What a movie! Who gives a squids bottom what the keyboard 'critics' or 'movie polls/scores' suggest...this had a great cast and superb visuals based on an unusual comic book that has translated well onto the big screen.At last we get to see the grand scale of the celestials, ominous and threatening and also a glimpse of the main characters who have lived many lives through the passage of time. Their hopes, ambitions, flaws makes for interesting developments in future instalments.Probably one of the most tricky of marvel adaptations to pull off, the direction is faultless and certainly captures that epic scope with both its big operatic action sequences and more intimate scenes.Only downsides was the deviant designs that are all too similar in modern science fiction fare but it's the grand celestial designers that more than make up for them.It also works well as a separate entity of the other marvel films and carries its own weight with heroism and grandeur that certainly opens the portals to the bigger marvel universe that fully embraces the heroes and legends of old as well as the future cosmic ensembles yet to come.I'm sure Jack Kirby will be puffing on his cosmic cigar with a wry smile."
2855,10,"Promising new Era!! What an excellent beginning for Eternals. I'm not sure why critics gave bad reviews, and Low rating in Rotten Tomato. Never trust those and go and watch it, you will enjoy your for sure."
2856,9,"An almost perfect movie Eternals is perfect and everything different from what I've seen at Marvel. A very long movie, but totally necessary to introduce the characters and tell their story, but, like every featuer film, Eternals has it's ups and downs.As much as many people have said that the film is very serious and that it loses the essence of Marvel, I disagree with that, but yes! The movie is more serious than others, but it still has good and well placed jokes like any other Marvel movie. One of the things I was most impressed with about this movie was the CGI, I've seen all the Marvel movies and none of them have I was so delighted with the special effects as in this one.However, in this film there are things that, at least for me, were not very good/very well explained, such as, a love relationship between two characters, I don't know if I interpreted it wrong, but I thought their relationship was too forced. Another thing that, at least for me, was not very well explained was about the Deviants and, specifically, which side they were on in the final battle (but I think I didn't understand it very well and not a scoop on the script).For me, Eternals isn't just any Marvel movie but perhaps one of the most important of the MCU phase 4, 'cause it presents a new group of superheroes very powerful. Now I just want a sequel to this movie and this wonderful cast.OBS.: The movie is amazing, the critics who are boring."

2858,3,"What a huge disappointment ""ETERNALS"" is a big fat mess, with many yawns and checking the time throughout, don't even bother paying your money for it. A fairly good cast wasted in mediocrity. The CGI is gorgeous, but that's all I can say positive for this movie.It's not even worth a review.But because it's ""MARVEL"", it will make money, unfortunately."
2859,7,"A disappointment, but still overall good I don't think this is the worst MCU movie like rotten tomatoes would suggest. But I do see why it doesn't work for a lot of ppl. When reading about Kevin Feige saying this is the best movie they've ever made. I feel like he was referring to the individual elements of the film but obviously couldn't take it back once seeing the full product.PROS:The characters are great and everyone get's at least their own little moment. The standouts to me were Druig and Kingo. Kingo brought the comedic energy the movie needed while Druig got the most substance behind his characterization.This is the BEST looking MCU movie. The cgi and cinematography were absolutely amazing. I really love how all of the eternals powers were portrayed, especially Makkari. To me this was the best display of super speed I've seen in any movie. Being rivaled only by the flash in ZS Justice League. With all the money marvel makes, they should definitely invest in shooting on location a lot more. It really does make a difference.CONS:CONCLUSION: I feel like this movie had the individual ingredients to be a masterpiece. But it's the sum of its masterful parts that disappoint."
2860,5,"Awesome visuals, but a long movie. I liked the visuals. I also liked the cast. You had a phenomenal cast of actors. Their acting was good. The plot for me was too complicated to follow. Not to mention, this movie could have been shortened just a tad if some of the scenes were omitted on the big screen."
2861,10,"Worst marvel film ever? You kiddin me? I had read soo many non spoiler reviews telling that this is the worst marvel film ever to have been made . Metacritics and rotten ratings were soo poor and I was just scared on how would the movie be as an ardent marvel fan .But to my surprise this one turned out to be soooo good , I loved everything in the movie the vfx , music , cinematography, actors and everything. It is very unique from the other marvel movies , you don't get the same old stuff what marvel has done before . I really don't know why people are hating this movie .Give this one a shot and watch it in IMAX 3D/2D for the best experience."
2862,9,Beautiful Movie! I've seen #Eternals today and it was great. I have no idea why some people hated it. I think the movie gave us what it was supposed to give. The cinematography and most of the acting were top-notch. Only issue was the pacing but it got better as the story progressed. 8/10 👏
2863,9,"Really enjoyed it Great acting from a star-studded cast. Despite the large number of characters, the writers managed to give everyone time to shine. The story was complex and a refreshing turn away from the standard 'good vs evil' you typically get from Marvel. That is not to say you'll get lost though - I completely disagree with the reviewers saying it was too 'dense' or 'confusing' or 'hard to follow'. My favorite part was Kumail Nanjiani's performance. Overall, I haven't enjoyed a Marvel movie this much since Thor Ragnarok. Definitely will be watching this one again."
2864,7,"Epic but unemotional EternalsSo there are Celestials, God-like beings. Arishem, one of them, allocates a bunch of Eternals (fairly God-like but not quite) to Earth, 7,000 years ago, to protect mankind from Deviants (unexplained monsters). This is their only job: they are not to interfere in human affairs. They wipe the Deviants out and then go their seperate ways, waiting to be recalled to their home planet. Then a Deviant appears...I enjoyed this and the eye candy is splendid, the action is beautifully choreographed. But it is one of the weaker offerings, and here is why.There are too many new characters and you don't get the chance to know them. This means you don't get emotionally invested in them. Yes, you care about whether xyz global crisis happens, but you don't really care about the relationships between the Eternals. A number of character-based subplots are introduced but never really go anywhere. The thing about the MCU is that you got to genuinely care about each character, which is why the deaths in Avengers 3 and 4 were so devastating. That is not the case here.Also, it is longer than it needs to be, to no purpose, and although the story is simple, it is unnecessarily complicated in the telling.Again, I enjoyed it, but it is probably 2nd or 3rd from the bottom of my list. It is competently - skilfully, even - assembled, but it has little heart."
2865,3,"It sucked Some believe you have to watch something twice to appreciate it.That is malarkey. The movie sucked and even all the henny on the rocks, the rum and sake I had couldn't make the experience enjoyable on either night. Eternals couldn't decide whether it wanted to adhere to the typical Marvel formula or be seen as high cinema. There are an excessive amount of characters on screen with little development if any development devoted to them or reason to care. The pacing is slow. By the time I reached the two hour point, I wanted the movie to end. And what's with the time-jumping?I enjoyed the production values on the ""historical scenes."" It makes you wonder how a modern sword and sandal movie would resemble but knowing the state of Hollywood, I doubt there would be much interest in one."
2866,9,"ITS AN ART My expectation was very low after reading the early critics review but after watching i was amazed, the movie was great overrall, asusual the same superhero movie story so i dont wanna talk about the story but it is better than the recent marvel movie shangchi, the pacing was fine, idk why every critic said the movie was too slow, visuals are spectacular especially the final makari shots, this movie have everything emotion, love and action. Overrall i enjoyed the movie lot and it is better than shangchi for me."
2867,6,"Wish it had been better I was surprised when all the mixed reviews for Eternals started coming in. It had a good cast, an interesting premise, and of course was directed by Chloe Zhao, so I (and presumably many others) had hopes it could be something really good, and a breath of fresh air in the MCU.Having now seen it, I think the somewhat unenthusiastic critical reception is less because the movie's terrible, but more because it's disappointing. It ends up less than the sum of its parts, because most of the cast is solid, some visuals are really good, Zhao's style does shine through on occasion, and the music is overall quite good. Humour is a mixed bag but a good deal does work.The only thing that's pretty bad is the action- it's either the Eternals fighting big CGI monsters, or magical beings throwing magic at each other. It's just not exciting, especially when that's all you get action-wise, and so many of those scenes are shot in dimly lit, murky environments.Pacing is a mixed bag. The slower rhythm of the film works for a good deal of its runtime, but the last 45-60 minute drags like crazy. And it's not helped by the climax being so boring- I didn't used to have a problem with the frequently criticised ""over the top MCU third act CGI-fest"", but it's been very noticeable in all of Marvel's 2021 theatrical releases so far. They need to start doing a better job at ending their films.Writing wise, it may have helped to have at least some slight introduction to some of the characters in this in an earlier movie, or else had one main character really focused on. Jumping into such a big ensemble and developing them all in just one movie doesn't really work, and neither do the villains either, in the end (what little antagonists we get).As a stand-alone movie, it's not great, but it's worth giving some benefit of the doubt that things introduced here will have satisfying pay-offs down the line. Phase 4 of the MCU needs a direction to go in, or to build to, and Eternals may have given us a hint of that.There are a number of parts of this film that work, and it's only the action and some of the pacing that I'd call actually bad. But it is a disappointment, for sure."
2868,5,"The storyline progresses too slowly For parents, I highly recommend reading a review or at least previewing the movie first to assess if this movie is appropriate for your kiddos.The movie itself has too many flashbacks... most/all are to help the viewer see the emotional development of the 'Eternals.' The movie itself starts as a flashback, goes to present day, Eternals realize there's a world threat, flashback, go visit other Eternals, flashback, go collect another Eternal, flashback, present day, flashback, world threat is getting worse, flashback, Eternals assembled, flashback, go fight big bad threat, end credit scenes. The movie feels slow, because the actual story line doesn't really progress... it should be summed up, 1. Here are the Eternals, 2. There's a world threat, assemble Eternals, 3. Fight world threat, 4. End credit scenes.Problems with the movie itself: 1. Too many holes in the story line... like, where were all the Eternals during Thanos's snap?2. End credits scene CGI was horrible.3. Many unnecessary things in the movie. Like a random sex sceneOtherwise, it's your typical Marvel superhero movie.End credits scenes are always interesting, but you can probably just go look those up online."
2869,6,"The movie was decent Due to traffic I missed the first 8-10 minutes of the film but I sorted picked up what happened, the story is decent, the visuals were great as always but I think the film was a bit slow at times, yes it was 2 and half hours but they also rushed through some plot lines that needed more time, overall this was an alright entry of new characters, I still think Shang Chi was better but that's my opinion. 6/10."
2870,10,"It's getting unnecessary hate First everyone says MCU movies are too much similar, and now when one is different they have problem with that? This is hypocrisy.Personally I liked it. I will any day choose this over Black Widow. All the MCU haters are just giving it negative reviews without even seeing the movie, because they know they don't get this opportunity too often."
2871,2,"Painful Felt like an old Toby Maguire Spider-Man.Lots of money spent.Lame plot.Winey character's.Kind of like watching ""Shield"" starts out decent and gets more bazaar as it progress.Seems to be the way of MCU."
2872,9,A Unique Visual Treat Eternals is very good and unique movie. It has got more human side than most superhero movies and that is beautifulPeople ask for something different and when they get it they start thrashing it. It doesn't feel like a mcu movie to people because it is different in an amazing wayDon't listen to the critics go watch it for yourself at the biggest screen it is a visual treat.it is a little slow but you will definitely not be disappointed.
2873,4,"Meh The most forgettable Marvel movie I've ever watched, didn't do anything outstandingly wrong, didn't do anything outstandingly right, lots of marvel diehards are disregarding negative reviews, saying the only reason people don't like it is because of their own prejudice; and while that does occur at a small scale, the movie as a whole is not being purposefully being dragged down by people who disagree with its decisions with the main characters, for people with those opinions do not make a large enough pool to majorly affect the movie rating wise compared to the amount of diehard marvel fans counteracting their gratuitus negative reviews, in terms of why I didn't give the movie a higher score, the pacing is bad and the movie itself was boring, it's something like 2 and a half hours long and it honestly feels like 3, furthermore the characters are forgettable, somehow the movie managed to be 2 and a half hours long and still give the feeling that it didn't elaborate on a characters enough. The movie isn't a 1/10, but it isn't a 10/10 either, it manages to leave a more negative, boring, why did I spend 2 hours and 36 minutes in a theater feeling than it does a satisfying, I enjoyed that meaningful non exposition dump of a movie feeling. Let's please accept that it's completely mediocre and movie on."
2874,7,"Worth to watch Well when I read the first reviews then I thought it will be terrible movie but it is not disappointed me it has enough entertainment. Movie has great visuals and cinematography, sounds are very good but it has some negative points like.movies entry scene is not good they described eternal very poorly by just writing some notes well that was very dull plus inspite of having long running time we cannot properly connect to the characters.and movies antagonist is a big problem well what would I say movie doesn't have one properly focused antagonist.but not just forget that Marvel's first characters movie were not much successful so we can better understand them in their next movie.you can watch this movie with your friends but if your family is not comfortable with just one or two intimation scenes in the movie then bringing them to watch is not a good idea movie has one scene but their is no nudity or serious violance so don't worry about that."
2875,8,"A breathtaking, immersive film... with a catch I am an avid MCU fan, and I went into this movie expecting a full blown sensual overload, and that is what I recieved, although to a slightly lower extent.We have to note the very essence of Chloe Zhao's direction. She is not your average action director. Zhao's perpetration in filmmaking is a journey through a medium of human empathy and emotion. Whilst this movie does not strive to be the next ""Endgame"", Zhao's employment of extended character responses, and thus the lack of any meaningful action act to challenge the essence of humanity within us.Yet at the same time, this challenges the foundations of the MCU.The positives... The visuals are INCREDIBLE. The continuous entanglement and subsequent evolvement of golden lines and formations are majestic visual features that have burned into my memory. The cast smashed it (what did you expect?) and Richard Madden & Gemma Chan outperformed their expectations.Also, the score was excellent, and seeing as Ramin Djawadi scored this film, I would have expected nothing less.However, the flip side in Zhao's direction is the very thing it aims to achieve. From a blanket point perspective, there are simply too many characters and too many threads of development. Therefore, the whole film can be very confusing if you lack the pre-reading.Furthermore, the film was 2hr 40min long. At times, it felt like a maddened rush to force the audience to accept every Eternal, despite many people not even knowing their names at the end.The ending was a tad underwhelming and I feel that with the emotive characterization Zhao employed, I feel that Ikaris should have carried his rage further before flying into exile, despite the comics.That being said, Eternals is a solid film, and with the excessive character introduction established, I am thoroughly looking forward to part two!"
2876,3,"The potential for greatness but held back by Marvel. This film had all the right ingredients for an absolutely groundbreaking and cinema changing experience, and yet it never quite put those ingredients together.I found myself with a constant feeling that something amazing was about to happen and yet towards the end of the movie I realised it would never come. The film would fall back into marval clichés after some original and incredible scenes, seemingly being moderated by Disney corporate commitiees.The ending is a perfect example of cookie cutter Disney and really highlighted how even the most original and ambitious Disney project likes to play things safe. It made me realise how almost every scene in this movie was a little muted and never really pushed too hard against the grain.This needs a re-edit and a Zach Snyder cut !"
2877,7,Appealing and Enjoyable but Execution is not worth the Plot build that is done throughout the film. Visuals are appealing.Storyline is build up well but the final execution didn't seem satisfactory enough considering this is a 160 min watch.Overall a good watch but don't expect too much.
2878,7,"A good movie, just not something i put into my favorites list While this is movie is severely flawed, and does get confusing, and might piss you off because of the run time, I won't say this movie is bad. In fact I really liked it. The story and writing isn't great. But what makes this a really enjoyable movie, is the acting, the visual effects, and the fact it dives deeper into long Marvel comic book lore. What's even more surprising I feel about this movie are the actors. I'd figure people like Angelina Jolie or Selma Hayek would play the characters to get the main focus, but I like how this movie gives them more a supporting role. Which I think is a good move, since as great as Selma and Angelina are as leading ladies, they still manage to still be great as supporting characters. What I really liked (also) is nothing in this movie felt phoned in or like the actors where sleep walking through a performance. Some might call the performances ""dull"" or ""boring"" or just flat out ""awful"", however i don't see that, i see exactally what i was expecting from a movie, about cosmic aliens, who obviously don't have the same emotional range like everyone else. But when any of the actors have to just act with their body language or facial expersions, it feels really honest and powerful. Everyone is honest and gives plenty of subtle passion and reserved energy, which is the sign of a good actor. But as I stated, the writing in this film isn't great. A lot of it involves non-leaner story elements having to do with big revelation (the kind you see in game of thrones). Basically its broken into two different movies, one that's backstory, and the other has to do with the main story. But I understand why Marvel did this. As it sets up the eventual introduction of the X-Men and mutants into the MCU, since the Eternals are a major part to the back story of the mutants origins. All in all this movie is good. And I believe all the problems in this movie will be redeemed in a potential sequel, because clearly this movie establishes plenty of great potential."
2879,5,2 Words to define it : Chaos and Boredom! What's good?+ 2 Stars : Visuals + 2 Stars : Locations and Production design + 1 Star : Potential (sadly lost)What's Bad?2 Stars : Screenplay (unnecessarily lengthy)1 Star : Mediocre acting1 Star : Mediocre Plot (chaotic)1 Star : Mediocre background score (doesn't even feel like Marvel Movie)This is easily a frontrunner to be the worst Marvel Movie.Recommendation : Save your time and money!
2880,7,"Visually Stunning I'm really not sure why there is so much hate for this film. Is Eternals Marvels worse film? No, that crown still belongs to Ironman 2. Visually stunning, Oscar winning Nomadland land director Chloé Zhao chooses epically beautiful worldly locations with added animated cgi to magnificent effect. With Marvels most diverse cast including an openly gay character and a story sweeping well an eternity there is a lot to take In here but these are characters that you actually care about. This is Marvel trying something new and I'm here for it."
2881,10,"A masterpiece, an incredible acting and visuals. Well after Shang-chi this is maybe the first time I've ever seen a movie like this .Incredible acting, visual-effects, a better way to introduce new characters, magical performances, and Eternal love for real and most importantly answers for some questions I've been asking myself about the whole time .Chloe Zhao did a great job with this movie, for me the most memorable acting is Lauren ridloff, Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan and Phastos of course .And exciting unbelievable 2 credit scenes great job Marvel for picking up Chloe Zhao for this one ."
2882,10,"Very different, yet one of the best. This film is not like the other Marvel movies, it's deep, it's not an ordinary fighting the bad guy, there are a lot of new characters and most of them have enough screen time. Finally something new, nice work to Chloe Zhao."
2883,5,"Too much going on I mean I enjoyed most of the film but when it came to the end it just became too ridiculous. Are we meant to believe that none of the avengers would notice a 2000 feet monster coming out of the earths core? Also the introduction of Eros(Mr Styles) seemed so forced and unnecessary. The MCU has always been calculated and well planned but the introduction of these Gods (Celestials) who have a power that cannot be matched creates so many problems for marvel and no one really wanted to see 2000 feet beings in the first place ? Also they are using the earth as some Matrix like thing!? So beyond stupid . The film itself was good but it's too much too soon especially after Kang, Multiverse the Dark Avengers there's already enough going on..."
2884,7,"Different And Interesting I don't know why, But critcs sucks. When I watch the movie I really liked it. The plot holes itself and the writing for the movie was good, All the star cast gave 100%. The vfx, Action sequence, Cinematography, directions was great.It's keep enjoying you while watching. And don't miss the credit scenes, I really love to watch what will happen next."
2885,8,"A different MCU take Eternals is a movie that will get more respect and appreciate over the time. Although I'd personal liked some parts of the movie, it still has some major flaws which pulled this film from being a masterpiece.I'll go through things that I liked and then move to ones I didn't care about.Okay, right from the beginning, this movie is just gorgeous. The cinematography is spectacular - every location is unique and unbelievable beautiful. The action scenes, though there were only three of major ones, were great, entertaining and kept me at the edge of seat.The characters were all amazing and the acting was absolutely fantastic across the board. My favourite character in this film was Thena played by Angelina Jolie. Once again Jolie proves that she always understands the assignment. She had the depth that her character needed. Thena's fight scene with Ikaris was just BOMBASTIC! Loved her and all that she did in this movie.My second favourite character is Makkari. Loved her CGI effects and her personality. My third and fourth favorite characters are Sersi and Phastos. Loved them both, especially Phastos at the end, we he was fight against Ikaris with Thena and Makkari.Sersi was great aswell, though I would've loved to see what she is capable of doing and maybe her powers should've been explored more. I also found Ajack to be pretty interesting, but I was disappointed that she died very early in the film. Ikaris was great both as a protagonist and antagonist. I think that he was just too overpowered. Kingo and Gilgamesh were both fine, didn't care about either of them. Sprite was the least character in my opinion. I tried to relate to her, but just couldn't do that, and her love-thing with Ikaris was just uncomfortable to watch.Now let's talk about things that I didn't care about. Sadly, the story is the first thing in this list. It was messy and had too many time jumps which were poorly made. Also it had too much exposition. Plus some of the plot details were just too confusing for a standard MCU viewer aka casual audience. The story also had too much drama and too much talking. The love triangle didn't work at all, because I couldn't see nor believe that there was something between Sersi and Ikaris or Sersi and Dane therefore it completely failed in delivering any emotional weight.The origin of eternals was just too confusing. The film didn't have enough action scenes to keep movie from being boring and tedious at the times.At the end, even with all its flaws, Eternals is a solid MCU film with gorgeous cinematography and great action scenes. Plus, it succeeded in making diversity a natural part of the movie - nothing was forced and none of the characters were special because of it.I'd say that the film is a 8/10 for me. It unfairly has the lowest RT score, but I hope that the audience will save this film from being a flop."
2886,9,"Awesome I know you wanted to make a different type of movie this time you were doing an experiment, I'm not saying that the movie was Worthless actually the actions was damn good but there was too much romance and drama you know but still I'm giving you 4.5/5 because you made 25 mind blowing movie out of 26, and yes obviously 26th is The Eternals and i can forgive your 1 mistake because you did lot to me. And your worst is still better than any other movie. And the Conclusion is movie was good no doubt but not better than any other MCU movie that's it."
2887,6,"Just whelming Joining the main critiques here. There was a lot of exposition going on despite being visually stunning.I went it not expecting much of it because I wasn't familiar with the source material, I believe you should be able to enjoy a movie as is without prior knowledge. But I did have some high hopes though, the casting was on point. Three Asian actors in the main cast of a superhero movie? It's like watching a unicorn give birth, it never happens.It felt like half of the movie (on a 157 runtime) was spent on the first act, it took that long for all the protagonists to fully assemble. I know that this is Marvel and they're setting up for future instalments, but I still think they could've cut some subplots and characters.Even the credits sequence was underwhelming to me, that's usually what I look forward to, and deal breaker for me. That being said, god bless Chloe Zhao for letting Richard Madden keep his Scottish accent. And points to Disney for finally following through with the ""first openly gay character""."
2888,8,"A fresh take on the MCU I had read some reviews, but went into this film with a completely open mind. Firstly, this does not feel like a Marvel film and honestly after the what feels like 50 or so films, this does not feel like a bad thing.Clearly the director was focusing on the more human element of the ironically non-human characters but for me this worked really well. The action was also well executed and stands up with the best of the super-hero movies.Few little gripes for me was that Angelina Jolie was massively underused, which is a shame as her character was arguably one of the most interesting. Secondly, the deviants didn't really make that much sense and didn't feel that threatening.However, overall I loved it; good comedy, great action and characters you actually care about. Make sure you stick around for the two post-credit scenes!"
2889,6,"Low Ranking Marvel Movie I think Eternals, while still a fairly decent movie, wasn't one of Marvel's best. This movie has an interesting storyline, but it doesn't really deliver it very well. I feel like it was a little stale at times, but also left so many unanswered questions. I feel like the end would have had catastrophic consequences, but everyone is walking around normally like nothing at all happened. Unless it somehow ties into Spider-Man: No Way Home at that same moment (but I don't think it can , given what we see on the news at the end), it just doesn't make sense.I did like that each member of the team offered something different. I could say more, but I feel like the more I think about it and come up with more confused questions, the less I would rate this movie. I will just leave it at that. It just doesn't REALLY fit, and I hope Eternals 2 will at least show how they fit into the Marvel universe.Good god, please do not start adding sex scenes to Marvel movies. It adds absolutely nothing and, honestly, left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie. Are people so dense that they cannot stop thinking about sex for one moment in every aspect of their life that they just need it be absolutely everywhere? I am not that person. While I do want my superheroes to grow and feel, it's easy to see people fall in love without the added awkward sex scene. Just...no."
2890,6,"Outstanding Visuals but lacks story.... Eternals are is quite different from any other marvel movie. From it's story to it's characterisation all are different from the other movies. Good points of this movie is it's OUTSTANDING VISUALS and the film looks very beautiful to watch from it's set designing to the eternal costumes all look fascinating. Then the mighty cast is so perfect to watch that it'll made your day. Then comes the action sequences which is good but it can be better. Bad points starts from it's Storyline, Director should've more focused on the storyline rather than the conversation and emotional connection of the characters. Screenplay is not so good because in the mid of the movie you feel bored with the conversations that the characters having in the movie. The movie is also slow paced which is good for the character building but not good for the mcu movie. Apart from this movie can definitely cut to 10-20 mins because so much conversation and group connection won't be required as much as in the movie. Rest of it all good you can definitely watch one time with it's beautiful vfx, star cast and the action sequences..."
2891,10,Stunning Zhao is a genius her care of Kirby's work is clear Amazing the representation of every demographic villains are a little under developed but I can't wait to see more.
2892,9,"Definitely MUST SEE Film This movie was paced well, with all the story packed into 2 1/2 hours I was not bored for 1 second of it! The characters are engaging, The direction was on point and cinematography was spectacularly beautiful, This is without doubt in my Top 10 MCU movies."
2893,10,"A new age of movies in the MCU I was actually very disappointed by the reviews I saw because it was a really great movie after Infinite War my favorite so far Maybe even better. Chloé Zhao One of the best directors I've ever seen in Marvel.I was a little worried that she may not be able to show the Eternals as they were In comics but she did well.Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden The very awesome Richard Madden played the role in the best possible way, the relationship between thena and Gilgamesh was so emotional. Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel were just was hilarious I loved their characters and the acting was very good too. The characterization was perfect visuals were extraordinary writing was good (turns and twists, cliffhangers, and... emotional but in the meantime hilarious) action sequences was one of the best in MCU kind that we have never seen anything like it. The comic references do not get me starting on that they were awesome you can't find any problems about this movie."
2894,10,"Makkari supermacy Best marvel movie yet; amaizing world and character building, natural character dynamics that work. Angelina Jolie and Gemma Chan ABSOLUTLY rocked it, and the plot was clever yet clear, with twists and turns that kept watchers invested, worrying for the fate of these seemingly outpowerd eternals. Filled with interesting Flash backs, realisti dialouge and stunning costuming, critics are really not giving eternals its moneys worth. Inclusive and diverse many many fans will feel recognised via. Marvels first gay couple, first mute hero, first asian Female lead and many more character deatails."
2895,8,"A slightly new flavour for Marvel, and a very tasty flavour indeed If I were to use one word to sum up Eternals it would be beautiful. Beautiful story, characters, score, visuals, themes. Everything in this film just felt like such a treat.What I loved most was how much there was to discover and learn. Eternals lifts the lid on a whole new world within the MCU and it was just a joy to get to know these new characters, who were all very different and exciting. I was concerned that introducing 10 characters would be a handful, but it was masterfully done. All of them felt well explored and developed and there were no weak links.As you'd expect from such a solid cast list the performances were great. Highlights were Gemma Chan, Richard Madden and Angelina Jolie, all of whom were so captivating, but really all of the cast nailed it.I thought the plot was very interesting. A few unexpected twists and turns, moral quandaries, compelling themes, exciting if a little repetitive at times action. A bit of a deviance from the usual MCU formula but a most welcome one indeed.As mentioned the visuals were stunning. Zhao's direction can't be faulted and was complimented perfectly by the epic score provided by Ramin Djawadi.As a final point, because I've seen other reviewers accuse the film of being slow, the pacing was absolutely spot on. It flowed so well, took its time but was never meandering or lost. For a film that is over two hours thirty it absolutely flew by.I got everything I wanted and more from this film. It was a visual feast and an engaging and compelling story with complex characters. Arguably a bit of a risk for the MCU but it has massively paid off."
2896,8,"Don't listen to the critics!! I went into the cinema with an open mind because of what critics were saying about this film. But Eternals was a really enjoyable film with great characters and special effects. It's not perfect, it has its flaws, but it was something new and different in the Marvel franchise. I don't know what film the critics saw, but it defiantly was not Eternals and doesn't deserve this much criticism. Solid 8/10 for me."
2897,8,"What's all the hate about? I still don't get why it's being set to be the worst MCU film... Far from it, I was personally pleased and surprised to find out they managed to work it out, despite having such a large cast and a setting as complex as Marvel Cosmic. I enjoyed each character's story line, I think they gave each a well deserved time on screen, and I even bought up their relationships and internal conflicts. It was very well structured. The visuals are gorgeous, the fights scenes are good and well distributed, there is a clear message... I mean, it is a story we have seen and read before, true, but it isn't poorly executed or acted or written. So I'd give it an overall positive review. Far better than Thor: The Dark World or Iron Man 3 or Black Widow. Quite frankly my only 2 issues were: (1) the trailers have major spoilers. (2) they say the Amazon is in Mexico (how did Salma Hayek not point this out?) and they have a Spaniard with a strong Spanish accent pretending to be from Latin America."
2898,6,"Eternals is so Fustrating Eternals is a painful movie for me. On one hand it's stunning visuals and incredible cast make me love it but the movie has too many problems for me to like it too much. Before it was released, the reviews started coming in from the critics giving it it's now infamous rotten tomatoes score. My statement on this is that I feel really bad for the movie and I still do. It had everything going for it from the cast, the teasing of there return and expansions on them with some cameos at the end (No I'm not talking about the main guy but the other guy who came with him, some sort of lilaputchian I think). But the movie tries to introduce 10 characters at once and only makes me care about maybe 5 at most. Although I thought that the deaths of some characters were sudden and took me off guard. The main problem really is that fact that I don't necessarily like the characters. I felt nothing for people like Ajax or Ikaris even though they were extremely crucial to the plot. These problems really stick out from me enjoying the movies visuals and scale (which is massive and does fit the movie even though some parts are a bit jarring). But the fact that I just don't care about most of the eternals really made me not care for the plot, such as how the world of captain marvel is great but Carol isn't (But better than most of these guys). The only thing I haven't really talked about the action sequences and I have only one thing to say, why Chloe Zhao to direct this. They're ok, just like Nomadland (On the same greatness level, don't think that Nomadland is an action packed thrill ride). This is a heavy superhero fighting movie that really doesn't fit the director, even though she is great and definitely deserves her two academy awards, it just shouldn't have been her movie. In conclusion, I do prefer Nomadland (for me low 7/10) to this but I don't think eternals too bad. But I think that the fact I liked the marvel studios titles (I love Pink Floyd's 'Time') more than almost all the scenes does say something. But I'd say if you're an avid MCU fan I would still go and see it, and stick around for the two post credit scenes for the cameos I mentioned earlier (just ignore the actor cameo in the first not the second(It is just a voice in the second though so don't get you're hopes up to much)). Overall it's a middle tier 6/10. Just a bit worse than Thor."
2899,9,"Amazing direction by Chloé Zhao Don't know why this film is defamed as worst mcu movie. Only thing in which movie lags behind is story , but chloé zhao's direction made this movie amazing special effects doesn't offers something new but they are pretty amazing. This movie tries to connect emotion between character and watchers ,but we are not able to connect with every character because of huge cast if we have got some kind of series about past of each eternals , that might have created a bridge of emotion between characters and watchers , and rating of this movie will definitely be over 9."
2900,8,"It should have been a Disney+ Series I think the only issue with this film is that it's a film.This should have been a series where each episode goes through the nuances of the Eternals, their relationships, and their journey over time. It does feel that when the scene was getting nice and powerful we have to cut to the next scene because it's a movie and we have limited run time.Considering it as a single movie, Chloe Zhao does a great job is clamoring the whole new lore into the MCU with perfect casting and unique characters. The Story was crisp and I never really felt bored. Yes these stories deserve time and they need to be developed and I feel a series would be great. A series would also help audience to watch at their own pace and actually enjoy these nuancesThe VFX was one of the best in the MCU and would love to see more of it! I am very excited about these stories!"
2901,10,Deserves a lot more credit I've just got home from seeing this movie. I honestly don't see why people rate it so low. It was definitely an opener for a much bigger story and hopefully the future of fade 4 will answer the questions left behind. The diversity and inclusivity was astonishing. I loved seeing myself represented. I've been slowly losing my hearing from the age of 5. Definitely going to watch it again tomorrow!
2902,10,"Amazing movie 10/10 This is the right movie for the marvel community. They will hate it from the start, but this movie will age like wine.I just don't understand the hate from all the BS critics."
2903,10,"A Love Letter To The Earth and Humanity If you are debating on whether to see this film, please do, you will not be disappointed.The Eternals has quickly become one of my favourite movies of the year. The storytelling is incredible and easy to follow between time periods. The cinematography was stunning and definitely should be experienced in IMAX if possible. The bigger message of this film is definitely to love and care for our planet while we can, because it and the people on it, are special. The film had highs, lows, shocks and laughs which is exactly what I look for in an MCU movie and with the cliffhangers at the end, I can't wait to see the Eternals again in future projects."
2904,4,"Marvel mediocre What a disappointment. Big cast, for whaf? Very poor script; they tried to put too much in, not much of a back story for the Eternals. No need to include so many characters (some were pointless), it's definitely the worst Marvel I have seen to date. The credits were just as bad and especially the guest appearance from a well know musician. I don't know how they will continue this story, it was so poorly written. Looking forward to watching Spiderman. This will be forgotten very quick."
2905,10,"Emotionally engaging and a breath of fresh air to the MCU The character development for an ensemble of characters this large was done so well! The effects and cinematography gave the film an ecclesiastical feel! Would definitely love to see how they fit into the MCU, especially Guardians of the Galaxy and Adam Warlock!"
2906,8,"Critics being totally unreasonable. It was a good movie. As Indian I don't mind lengthy movies. But it was not boring. It's very difficult to engage and connect with so many characters in one movie but they did a better job compared to many similar movies like suicide squad , X-Men movies , fantastic four movies. For an origin story it was one of the best. We can't expect origin stories to be extraordinary all the time. I thought they would make another movie like x-man where they don't introduced characters and jump into actions. I would prefer series for this kind of huge case and story line but nevertheless the movie was enjoyable."
2907,7,"In the grand scheme of MCU... where do Eternals exist? In the grand scheme of MCU... where do Eternals exist? I can't connect the dot... don't see how it move the current MCU timeline... felt very disconnected and separated.Eternals as the almighty demi gods are not that powerful actually... Thor can beat all of them easily. It took them thousands of years to eliminate the Deviants. Thor and Hulk can do same things in 5 years easily.Eternals should not exist in the MCU... but seeing it as a standalone movie without thinking how it relates to MCU... I really like the movie.It's a high concept movie similar to Dune where it centers around theologies... kinda biblical approach in telling the story of how the universe and human beings were created and evolve.I also believe the writers are afraid to delve deeper in the theologies aspect because they need to put this movie within the MCU and this made the movie feel uneven and all over the place.Overall I enjoy the movie... the fight scenes are amazing and THIS IS ANGELINA JOLIE movie... I don't care about other characters.. if Marvel decide to write off the movie from MCU because of the worst MCU reviewed movie status... I don't care BUT Thena should live on in the MCU... she have the best power set among the Eternals.If you approach this movie thru MCU thoughts, I don't think you gonna like the movie but it still a recommendation from me 7/10.Black Knight is a great Marvel character... can't wait to see Jon Snow become The Black Knight. In the comics he's also a member of The Avengers."
2908,8,"Eternals: Big Picture Thinking First thing first; this is NOT the worst MCU movie, not even close. There is a LOT to love about this movie; it looks amazing, balances a lot of characters well and is certainly the most epic film in terms of scale. It is not your typical MCU film but that's no bad thing. There a lot of weighty dialogue and some topics are quite earnest and philosophical, but I prefer that over the vacuous content of many other films. And, as origin stories go, at least this one tried to do something a little different, merging material from the comics, with some original ideas and content.There are flaws however. The action sequences aren't always as impactful as they could be and some of visual effects feel a little rushed. The scope of the story won't appeal to everyone and the ending may leave a lot of viewers scratching their heads.People have been drawing comparisons with Dune, saying that DV's film shows how to make sweeping large-scale with complex characters and gravitas. Dune is a technically superior film to the Eternals, but here's the thing; I appreciated the craft and diligence of Dune, but I enjoyed Eternals more. Dune is intellectual but quite cold, whereas Eternals has a lot more heart."
2909,8,A New Marvel Era Watched it yesterday and not dissapointed at all. It was a great start for a new era in MCU and I am so excited to see more of it. Eternals is different that is sure but has many potential to make another great franchise. Dane Whitman is the next main storyline that we need to see. With his 10 minutes of screentime Kit Harington stole the movie. I loved the twist in the film. There were boring parts but nowadays all movies have it weaknesses. After all Eternals worth to watch and it will be an amazing new journey.
2910,5,"Sure it's different but that's ok Some of the reviews here are just not fair at all... ""not enough humour"", ""too diverse"", ""too long""...so I'm gonna be genuine and fair hereThe plot of this film was one of the most interesting we've seen from the MCU. Two and a half hours isn't long for a movie. If you think it is then why did you go and watch it? One of the big controversies in Eternals was the diverse cast. I honestly thought when I saw the initial reviews it was gonna be really in your face but it wasn't. None of the cultures were main plot points of the film. Sure Kingo was a bollywood actor but that was only really the setup for a few pretty funny jokes. At no point did this film try to focus on the cultures of the actors as like an empowerment thing. It was normalised, not forced. The actors did a great job and their chemistry was fairly good.Eternals, I'd say, is the first MCU movie that pushes the boundaries a bit. The jurassic park-like violence, a few weak but still present jump scares and the less humouress, more serious tone - all factors not really present in the MCU until now. I would say it's like the DCEU but it's well better than those films. The constant only moderately funny jokes in marvel films get old after a while and I'm glad this one toned it down a bit in that department. And the jokes, when they were there, weren't actually too bad.The big thing this movie has really got going for it is the cinematography. Very well shot movie, however every reviewer has touched on this so I won't delve into it.I said I was going to be fair so here it is. I think Kro was a little underused. He's a pretty cool character and I would've liked to see more of him but there's always a chance he could come back. I mean it is marvel we're talking about. Same with a few of the Eternals but the feelings not as strong for me. I mean there's always gonna be more marvel movies right?Last but not least the post credit scenes were really good and set up some very epic story lines that I would love to see in a sequel or spin-off."
2911,4,"How weak. Incredibly disappointed with Zhao This whole film was a big piece of mediocrity with a splash of horrible writing from Oscar winning director Zhao.-Production, cinematography was top notch as always coming from Marvel.-The music score failed to connect with the audience in so many ways. Bad choices.-Salma Hayek is by far the worst actor 😆along with Gilgamesh, Don Lee.-One of the biggest problems with the script was the lack of a concerning antagonist. When presented, it absolutely lead to a dead end. No where in the film did i feel the ""eternals"" were ever in trouble. On the flip side these ""eternals"" didnt feel strong at all...mediocre. Zhaos attempt to bring a human connection to a super hero film was a hopeful but missed the mark. Wait for the stream...free one that is."
2912,1,"Great action, almost no character development The action sequences are really cool, but I wish they would have made this a show first and given each Eternal a full 1-hour episode so we would actually care about them as characters. There are also some really jarring tonal shifts and some aspects that make it impossible to take anything in this movie seriously. For one, there are a bunch of needlessly confusing flashbacks. Also, the Big Bad looks like a Bionicle with a LEGO face, which is just too goofy to be scary. There's a lot more I could say, but I don't want to include spoilers."
2913,10,"A movie worth watching! If you have ignored watching because of the low/bad review it has been given, you are soo wrong! Never decide a movie is good/bad based on the review that people post on here or anywhere else. Watch it yourself, first and then share your opinion.I was sad to see that this movie was review bombed but that didn't stop me from watching this movie. I loved it and it was worth the wait. Amazing storytelling, visuals and my favourite - the music! Everything was just right in this movie and I can't wait to see what future plan Marvel has for these characters.Do wait for the 2 end credit scenes. You're gonna love it!"
2914,8,"Why all the hate? This movie was a spectacle. While it is long, and not as witty as the other Marvel films, the characters are likeable and the effects are amazing. The plot also went in unexpected directions, and the ending set up a sequel that I for one am very excited to see."
2915,8,"Still good I don't know why y'all are so mad about this movie! I watched it today walking into it reading all the bad reviews and good ones, and when I sat down to watch it started off kinda slow and I was like ok that's why the reviews are not great. But then it got good!Everyone keeps walking into marvel movies thinking it's going to be a Thor Ragnarok, and that's why they get let down. Black widow was a great movie not as good as Thor Ragnarok but it was still a great movie, this is the same why!It is a Beautiful movie and the fight scenes are great, on top of that we got two credit scenes ( one mid credit and one end credit) that is really worth the wait and will probably lead up to an Eternals two!For whom even reads this review just give this movie a chance it's actually a really good one and you might like it!"
2916,9,One of the deepest Marvel movie This is one of the very few movies that actually gives me unexpected twists and turns and in a good way. The director has done an amazing job in depicting and developing the many characters and delivering a strong message in a great depth in a short time.
2917,5,"Just a Meh for Me Some good elements here and there: funny jokes, mildly entertaining fights, and some quality acting pieces.I personally found most of it pretty boring. I felt little investment in the characters (which is to be somewhat expected in new entries). While I really enjoyed Shang Chi and the energy it brought to the table, this one just fell flat for me.I also didn't care for the effects on this one, which feels unusual for a Marvel movie."
2918,7,"Enjoyable This was quite good, entertaining and also quite a bit of humour. The special effects are exceptional and definitely keep up with the other Marvel films for quality. I didn't feel like it was too long or that any scenes could have been cut. It all made sense and was a good popcorn flick best experienced at the movies."
2919,10,"Must see I went into this movie with low expectations because of some things I had heard but this movie deserved non of it, on top of being visually stunning and the cast being likable, this film went above and beyond in expanding the marvel universe to its next phase as it introduces an incredible new team for us to enjoy."
2920,10,"Loved it Seen this twice.I'm far from a movie reviewer but this is nowy favourite MCU movie. Looked beautiful, story was interesting. Characters were wonderful and the fight scenes were far more exciting than I expected. Wholeheartedly recommended."
2921,10,"Beautiful and much more than a superhero movie Eternals is not the same old superhero formula movie. This movie is beautiful in every aspect from character introduction their development, flaws, insecurities to visually stunning, amazing cinematography. It shows that even godlike beings can have flaws and insecurities and are also humane and this movie can connect to people in many different ways. I loved every second of this movie."
2922,9,"Ignore the negativity reviews - go watch it and form an opinion based on your personal experience. Eternals is a Marvel movie like no other but in a good way. Heading in a different direction from what we have seen previously, Eternals brings the MCU into a new realm of story-telling that breaks away from the typical Marvel formula.A standout aspect of this film is truly its diversity with Chloé Zhao and the rest of the team behind this film truly pulling together a truly beautiful and diverse narrative which speaks to the heart moreso than it does the mind.After years of formulaic movies, Eternals takes the MCU in a new, more mature direction and it is refreshing to see. Chloé Zhao definitely succeeded in bringing a fresh perspective into the MCU diverging from a story that is driven purely by the action and thrill of it all, to give us a story that has heart and love behind every aspect.As expected, this film was a visual masterpiece, where everything that we see manages to work alongside the story being told. The acting was amazing with Gemma Chan truly standing out and capturing the heartfelt essence that is driven by this film. Also, just to mention Angelina, a growing favourite of mine, who truly took the helm in each and every one of her scenes, bringing to life this strong and powerful warrior.The story itself definitely meets what it set out to achieve, however, it is also the key downfall point of the movie. Though it carries a lot of weight, the aspect where the movie fails is where they tried to incorporate maybe a bit too much story without truly figuring out how to go about making it fit into one cohesive puzzle.Overall, it was still an incredible watch and I cannot wait to watch it again. I would definitely go about saying that it makes it into my personal top 10 favourite Marvel movies!"
2923,10,Don't Judge Eternals Ratings. Don't Judge Eternals By Rating It is Worthy To Watch i in Theatres Marvel Fans Do not Disappointed After Watching This.All Action Scenes Are Awesome Must watch On Big Screen As Possible As Climax Is So Interesting and Two Post Credit Scenes Are Must To Watch.
2924,8,"Did what it had to do really well Considering how much Zhao had to fit into 2.5 hours, from many characters, constructing and developing them, introducing celestials/deviants/eternals, plot... she did a pretty good job. The characters felt distinct, plot relatively easy to follow, and it introduced new concepts without inducing a headache.Visuals were also stunning, and most humor felt natural to the dialogue and most landed with me, although they didn't make me laugh out loud, it made me smile and induced chuckles amongst my crowd.Biggest cons were pacing issues, mostly with repeated information and a bit too many flashback sequences that broke the flow at times. Another big con was that the two leads, sersi and ikaris, lacked chemistry. It didn't feel like they were in love for 5000 years, so the ending felt contrived and unnatural.Other than that though, I find this a solid addition to the mcu."
2925,10,Amazing movie😍😍 I really loved this movie and it has been my favorite. I liked how Thena was involved and she was one of the characters I was looking forward towards this film. She is strong and powerful too. She is like a goddess of warrior. But definitely reminds me of Wonder Woman.
2926,6,"The ""Meh-ternals"" This movie is not Marvels worst but definetely not the best. I get it. The story is meant to be a little more phylosophical and rhater more adult, so to so to speak, than other MCU films and there is nothing wrong with that, but my problem is that at least make that entertaining and this felt too slow.And despite having good themes and plots somehow the characters feel flat.Like Druig with the mind control of a a complete town, there was so much potential there and some moral dilema that could've been interesting exploring. Or also how the Sprite dilemma of wanting to grow up and her existential crisis was handled so bannaly.And don't let me rant about all the foreshadowing and exposition that was so lame and predictable. Yes this is an origin story and yes we do need the big reveal but come on, a big sentient voice just flat out telling it felt so boring for a superhero movie.And the ""tottaly unexpected"" reveal of a traitor among them all along is so painfully obviousI think with these movie they bit little too much more than what they could chew. This has a lot of potential that goes nowhere, to many characters that go nowhere and a very prefictable result.Is not unwatchable but definetely could've been better."
2927,9,"Don't listen to the critics and enjoy it for what it is! Who cares about what the critics say! It's different from other Marvels movies and it is not necessary a bad thing. I certainly did enjoy it.Perhaps Chloe Zhao, Kevin Feige and crew can release a ""shorter cut"" for those who only enjoy actions (rather than good story-telling)."
2928,2,"Just not very engaging The trailer had me really excited for the film but it the film was a huge disappointment. I usually don't mind films that are this long but this was quite hard to tolerate. The characters were too shallow. Adding to many main characters made me not care about them or develop a connection with them.Secondly the IMAX switching aspect ratio were a bit too much.However, apart from all the downs this film has it feels good to look at and the soundtrack is just beautiful."
2929,10,"Fanatics This was such a beautiful film with a wide diversity of what and who a superhero is.Most of all the story gives hope to humanity and reminds you of what is truly important in this world. Love, friendship, hope, family! <3.I can see why many ppl won't get this since they just want action action action. But c'mon guys dig a little deeper inside your souls don't be so colorless."
2930,10,"Why did they want to do this? I am very surprised I think the movie is a safe 8, I particularly loved it cos I already expect a linear 3 act structure with no surprises from any marvel movie that has ever existed. The Eternals in that matter is the first one I found somewhat hard to predict.It is easily one of the hardest movies to direct, is up there with Watchmen or the dissapointing Dune.I dont get who the target audience here is. Young adults that grew with Marvel but are done with the childish plots?The most important part for me is that it opened the door for a Lovecraft adaptation with an outer god, the window was already open, but now is a wide door. In my opinion, The Eternals: is a cosmic horror story thats almost impossible to tell juggling 10 characters in 2 and a half hours with massive representation that feels organic af."
2931,7,"As always Marvel seems to Amaze us in all possible manner! Hell with the critics over here! You all literally sock(if you what I mean)!This movie was really good and the visual effects was super stunning!As always Marvel always try to amaze us in all ways possible!Go watch it now!(yeah in between it was a bit like little stretchy, but it's because it's got more characters to show and 2 and half hours isn't enough so yeahhh, get it?)"
2932,10,"Amazing. Despite its share of issues, Eternals is by far the best mcu project to come out this year for me. It has compelling visuals, great characters, and a masterful music score by Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi. The plot is rather unpredictably unpredictable, and the final result is nothing more than an oxymoronically flawed masterpiece. The critics definitely failed their charge with this one."
2933,1,"Made an account just to say how bad this movie is. AWFUL. Marvel doesn't handle super powered heroes well. This felt like their inhumans endeavor and I am hoping that they write this out of canon too. Zero character development. They wanted to be Avengers and Justice League and all we got was like some Netflix B version of both combined.Totally disappointed because Loki and What If set this phase 4 up so well and somehow we got this mess. They spend too much time in the past. I'm still not sure who the villain was.Also a cataclysmic event like the end of the world would have surely got the attention of captain marvel or the Avengers. Not this b squad. They spent so much time trying to make it connect and the character name drops of the other movies were so misplaced and forced. Almost like it was a different movie and Marvel made them do reshoots to include them.I don't recommend that you see this. Shang Chi was great. This stunk so bad that they need to just cut their losses, leave it self contained and just pretend it never happened. Honestly this movie could sink the entire marvel universe."
2934,7,"Great movie, but short timed even with that much screen time It was a good movie, very different from what Marvel has done which is good because they're moving on another direction. More mature, dark, philosophical and with a serious tone on the most part. However, as the direction goes different the issue for people who aren't fans of marvel, haven't watched all the movies, and also have knowledge far away from the MCU, but comics is that the movie is way more complex than previous ones. So they start the movie expecting you to know at least the basics of each character, which for some people is not enjoyable. Maybe if they had more time to introduce all of the characters in a previous 10 chapter mini-series before the movie or something similar it would've been better, because it is impossible to present that many characters in one movie. Apart from that great visuals, good storyline, not perfect because some of the scenes are jumping in time but it still understandable. Such great acting as well. The only bad thing of this movie is that it left me needing more, I felt like the story was not completed for many characters and they were killed without letting us know about them and it's disappointing that we won't ever as well. 7, 000 thousand years of history that wants you to explore more. On the end, it was fast but enjoyable. P. S I really needed more of Salma in the MCU such a shame that an important character and actress as her got a weak storyline and we won't see her in the future."
2935,4,"Disappointed My whole family supports Marvel and we watch every movie since Captain American until we got to the Endgame, this movie was a mess, great bc ast but not enough relation to Avengers only a mention of Captain. And Iron man being gone? Sex scene and way too much for kids never thought that I'd seen such movies corrupted by the wokeness, I only hope Spiderman coming up in December doesn't include the mess this movie presented so so disappointed 😔"
2936,8,"WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT This movie was good, not great but still way better than what the critics say it was... not only that, I think this could be great for Marvel cuz ppl like me are going to watch this movie just to see what the whole criticism are about. And let me tell you, went in there with low expectations and came out satisfied, and the end credits were equally surprising (in a good way)"
2937,1,It's hard to overstate how unimportant this is Take away the monumental visual effects and what do you have? Boring inflated egos underscore this massive tedious try-hard of a movie. Do you really care about this movie? No. It's something to watch. Don't pay for it. Wait until it's at the library.
2938,10,Cinematic masterpiece The Eternals is a cinematic masterpiece. From start to end this movie is a hit. This is probably one of the best Marvel movies ever made in my opinion. The acting was spot on. The action was spot on. This was just a flawless movie. I highly recommend this movie. Also stay for the credits it's a must for sure.
2939,7,"Not as terrible, nor as amazing as critics say Given how diverse the world of the eternals is, I think this movie did perfectly at introducing us to it and giving us the background story to what lies ahead. But the diversity also caused a problem, there are ten different eternals and none of them really get that big a spotlight so we never get to feel attached to them, so when one of them are lost we don't feel the emotion as much.The dialogue, more especially in the beginning of the movie is so full of hackneyed phrases and concepts, which made the rest of the movie a bit predictable to me. As expected for Marvel movies, the visuals were stellar to look at but the fight scenes didn't leave me that impressed, heard someone say they resemble video games, I don't agree but get why. And as the recent trend in MCU, they tried adding some comedy to it, not as much as the other movies but it's there. My biggest problem was it all felt a bit anticlimactic, I don't think it was boring, just quite bathetic over the 2hrs. Maybe it's because I expected that Tiamut, the new born celestial was gonna put up more of a fight but it all ended relatively quick instead. I'm not really stuck on what happened in this movie, but more about what's gonna happen in the next, feels like that's where the action is going to be and it's sorta giving me guardians of the galaxy vibes.I think as a genesis to the next chapter of marvel films, this was a great movie especially if you haven't read through the comics. It does a lot of things right and there's nothing it actually does horribly wrong. I feel like the other reviews are judging it to the extremes were it's either really terrible and dull, or calling it absolutely exquisite. I think that it just deserves a watch and the sequel will be what's gonna be either really poor or really exquisite."
2940,7,"Mixed Bag I got back from seeing Eternals a couple hours ago, and I have praise and criticism towards this movie. I feel like it tried to do too much, so the emotional connection and payoff was a little lost on me. The pacing was a little off, but when it got closer to the end was when it started to get really good. I loved the LGBTQ+ representation as well as the score and action sequences. Nevertheless, go check it out if you're an MCU fan, especially considering how polarizing it is."
2941,9,"Wonderful Visual Movie Eternals is now in my top 10 Marvel movies. It's a new direction for the MCU and a new style, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The plot was easy to follow and the characters were easy to love and connect with. The style of the movie was clean and almost abstract which was interesting to experience. The fighting sequences and strengths of the characters were powerful and very entertaining to watch. I love the dynamics seen between the characters. My favorite thing about Eternals though, was the cinematography. The visuals and setting were insane, each shot being mesmerizing to look at. The storyline was interesting and had plot twists that left me shocked. I found myself getting emotional along with the characters. Overall the movie as a whole was well done, but it's not the best the MCU has created. Eternals makes me hopeful for the new phase of Marvel."
2942,10,"Great movie!!! I don't know why the critics hated this movie. Everything was fine except for a 10 second 18+ scene, rest everything is fine. Amazing cast, Great storytelling and amusing twists and turns. It's really different empowering every section of the society. For me it's a 10/10. Just an heartbreaking ending."
2943,8,"Pretty great movie Eternals is a pretty good movie. Don't go into it with the thought of the traditional fight the whole Marvel movie (which we all love). This was more story packed into the fun 2.5hrs with plenty of fight scenes. Sets up for more in the future with that of what you may be wanting with the ""joking one liner traditional style Marvel story and characters"". So sit back and enjoy something that sets up for the future of Marvel!"
2944,10,Cinematic masterpiece The Eternals is a cinematic masterpiece. On every level this movie was awesome. The acting was great the action scenes were some of the best action scenes I have seen in a Marvel. I highly recommend this movie it is a must see. Also stay for the end credits you won't want to miss it.
2945,8,"Good marvel movie - ignore the hate Before I saw the movie I looked at the reviews and obviously saw the rotten tomatoes score and I was disappointed. I was so excited for this movie and thought it was going to be great.My advice is, these ""critics"" stink. I enjoyed the movie and didn't feel it dragged at all. It was not the best marvel movie ever, but it is most definitely not the worst or even close.Eternals adds a new layer to the already stacked MCU and I'm excited for what the future holds. There's still a bunch of questions I have, but I'm sure they will be answered in the future."
2946,10,"Big things lie ahead I honestly have no idea why this film is being bashed. No clue. It has the action of course, comedy that works, character development that covers all characters, a LOT of emotions, and sets up so much to look forward to. The cast is phenomenal, they all work off of each other so well and that is good when it comes to a big cast. The stakes gradually rise as the true plot builds itself and all is revealed so by the time the 3rd act comes and all cards are on the table, you feel it all. The ending itself is something Marvel hasn't quite pulled before and it was quite nice, definitely sets up a huge plot element for the possible sequel.I won't say much about the end credit scenes, but I will say that they mean a lot in terms of expansion in the MCU and introduce key characters.You can tell that Marvel is changing its formula and it panned out very well here. This experience will definitely have audiences excited for No Way Home's experience."
2947,4,"Eternals has no soul It wasn't that ""Eternals"" was bad as much as we have come to expect so much more from Marvel. You never really care that much about any of the bland characters. The story gets pretty out there even for a Marvel movie but it's the erratic flow of the story telling that makes it fall flat. Additionally if the wokeness that we were subjected to in this movie is a sign of this to come, the MCU is headed down a dark road for which there is no redemption."
2948,2,High expectations High expectations with this movie since the director of this movie had won an oscar for an amazing movie and with the trailer it made me want to watch it as soon as it came out. When I watched this movie oh wow I had a lot of bad stuff to say. This movie had amazing visual effects but throughout the movie it was so boring also it had slow pacing and alot of characters who did not have space to develop.
2949,5,"I genuinely feel like I watched a different film than the critics I don't get how a film like Ant-Man & the Wasp can get the kind of reviews it did while this gets the kind it did. That movie was so bland and boring and forgettable. I think the same for the MCU Spider-Man films as well as Thor Ragnarok. I do not understand what makes those good films at all. I feel like such little imagination went into them. While I think representation is important, it doesn't resonate with me personally being a straight white male. So all that aside, I seriously thought this was a freaking awesome movie. I saw so many reviews saying it was the least fun MCU film or way too exposition heavy... and it was confusing how it jumped back and forth through time. I found it to be a pretty simple and straightforward story to follow. The only real exposition dump was when Ashirem or whatever the main celestial name is was explaining everything to Sersi. Otherwise I never felt overloaded with information. I thought the action scenes were insane! Makari has the best speedster special effects I've seen. So much fun to watch. The story had some solid twists, maybe nothing revolutionary, but very few MCU films have that... I don't know man. That ending battle was awesome, the deviants, while they looked like creatures from Pandora in Avatar, still had their own unique feel to them. No I didn't follow absolutely everything, it'll take another viewing for me to do that probably, but overall I thought this was a fantastic entry in the MCU. How in God's name this is the lowest scored film I have no idea. I absolutely loved Shang Chi and put that in my top 5 MCU films and after my first viewing of Eternals I genuinely feel like this is pretty high up in my ranking as well. I officially could not care less what critics say about movies anymore. They also said the post credit scenes were insane, which they weren't at all. I guess if you're a REAL die hard Marvel fan you'll like them. But if you are, you've already seen the movie so yeah. If a celebrity cameo is a reason to flip out than yikes."
2950,9,"Spectacular movie all around Honestly it soared pretty high at my list of my favorite marvel movies. To introduce an ensemble of 12ish characters is not easy, but somehow I left the movie understanding everyone's character, flaws, pros, and even their name! I usually struggle remembering everyone's name in big cast movies like this.The entire film was emotional, action packed, and gorgeous to look at. The creepy scenes were creepy. The emotional scenes were emotional. And the jokes were hilarious. Very good movie all the way around with albeit a couple weak spots. SPOILER: The mains deviant felt sort of useless in the grand scheme of things, but at least they kept the action going and gave the ending the surprise it was going for."
2951,8,"Fantastic and Beautiful Leave it to the critics fo drag a movie that features a diverse cast and LGBTQIA+ representation.This movie was beautiful. The characters were well developed and the movie poses a lot of philosophical questions. What is the greater good? What's truly evil and what's good?The cast and crew did a wonderful job. Yes, the movie is long and perhaps there are some pacing mishaps, but that's about it. It's worth a watch. These are fantastic characters to meet and enjoy. They have LAYERS!It's unique and worth watching."
2952,5,"So disappointing I have been waiting for this movie since I saw the trailer, I had so many expectations thinking it would be at the level of Avengers:Endgame, watching the movie it felt like the characters needed more development their dialogue was so bland, maybe a series would have been better, most of the times I thought that the characters were doing random things, like the Bollywood star who at the end of the movie randomly disappears or the little girl who stabs her friend and a day later they are like oh I will miss you so much, don't even mention Ikarus flying to the sun like what was that, the celestial emerging from the earth didn't cause any tsunami, no one came to look at what was happening, some marvel characters can teleport like dr strange but no one cared, the deviants were moving at the speed of light tracking all the Eternals, deviants felt like a filler wanna be villain I expected more from their leader he just appeared out of nowhere on the beach in the last fight scene and went into a cave, like why? I truly wanted to like the movie I bought the tickets a month ago, I had so many expectations, but the movie failed to deliver what it was promising. Easily the worst marvel movie of all. Shang Chi and the 10 rings is 10x better than this movie."
2953,8,"Beautiful scope and visuals leading Marvel to a new direction. 4 out of 5 stars.Eternals is beautifully stunning when it comes to a cinematic superhero film which director Chloe Zhao does well in capturing fantastic settings and scope. The film is way different comparing it to other marvel films. Zhao is aiming high for more of a compelling dramatic tension with the characters and great cinematography shots. And visual effects. The film does struggle with its pacing which can make it feel a little slow.What worked?The plot is great. The story gets bigger in the mcu. Showing Eternals which are immortal beings that have lived for 5000 years. Living among humans. While there agenda is protecting humans from deviants. There is more to the plot which gives it a twist about the Eternals hidden agenda. And a third act twist which a villain rises and divides and fights against the eternals. The idea of a celestial being born and needing to demolish worlds is an epic and thrilling direction.The cast ensemble is huge and all worked great with there characters. Gemma Chan did great as Sersei. Richard Madden is great. Along with Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, and Kit Harrington. In the movie, the Eternals did a great job working as a team. Every character stood out. Jolie and Ridloff were awesome. Kit Harrington has a small brief role. There is a seed planted for a much bigger part for him in the mcu world.The cinematography, music score, production settings, and visual effects are all great and worth watching. It does feel like watching a big budget artsy film with a superhero theme. The film does have a long epic run time which gives it enough time for it to develop the characters. Lots of flash backs through the centuries. While they try to find each other on Earth. The film spends most of the time with Ikaris and Sersei trying to locate the other Eternals on Earth. So they can preparing for an upcoming doom.The action sequences were good. Chloe Zhao played it too safe and avoided overdoing it which makes the movie feeling a little quieter compared to other mcu movies. A few good action scenes. And a climatic fight trying to slow the villain down to save the world.What did not work?Eternals is slow moving with its pacing. It does have a pacing issue which sets up for an exciting adventure and a epic showdown. It gets slowed down with too many expositions with the characters that the script slows down.Overall, Eternals is epic, it is beautifully shot and done with a great cast ensemble, and a story that is taking mcu to a direction that has yet to be explored. Even with the slow pacing, it is still one enjoyable ride.There are two credit scenes, one mid credit which introduces a new character, and a post credit scene which hints for a characters fate for future movies."
2954,9,"A better team than the Avengers? I don't understand the amount of hate this movie is getting... specially when I would consider it to be one of the best movies they've put out since Endgame. This movie feels different, yes, but is it a bad thing? It IS a superhero movie, with cool action and effects... but it also does something special by slowing the pace down a bit and focussing on the characters and their relationships. This is what I think the movie excels at, basically doing a beautiful job showcasing the humanity of each one of the characters. It is a movie about a family, something that the Avengers have been telling us they are for years, but unlike them, this group actually feels like they love each other; and so, when conflict arises between them, it feels complex and nuanced. Though the plot stakes are huge already, it's the emotional stakes that are given a chance to shine... and I was able to enjoy that a lot. The cast is large, and so it's unfortunate that a few characters didn't have a chance to be fully explored, but I wouldn't say it was a true downside. After all, the story is not about one character, but about them as a unit, and we do get to focus on those who drive the conflict.There are many aspects I loved about this film. For once, the humor was an other aspect I enjoyed, specially the character of Karun (who I believe stole the show). The way they play into that easy family banter was great, and I felt like all the characters had great chemistry in that aspect. What can I say other than, all the jokes landed and had the entire cinema laughing. Of course, I also grew to care for most of the characters as well... because dammit, most of them are just wholesome and lovable. The big dilema and existencial questions tackled were very interesting too. By the end, you can understand all sides, and I find that to be very cool (it's not just good vs evil, it's way more complex than that). Even the characters who are supposed to be seen as ""bad"", have motivations that make sense, and could be considered righteous.. It's great stuff.Overall, I am very disappointed to see all the hate directed towards this movie. Sadly, it was bound to happen that the most diverse movie marvel has ever put out would get the most backlash, but it's still hard to see. All I can do is wonder how anyone could look at a movie that celebrates humanity and think including as much humanity as posible is a downside.Maybe this movie will not be beloved by all, but I liked it and I'll shout it from the rooftops."
2955,5,"Enjoyable But Disappointing Great visuals, good acting, interesting ideas, and amazing cinematography. But a poor unorganized plot that is rather disjointed and confusing, and writing that feels like it is occasionally having an identity crisis hold this movie back from being something truly amazing. Chloe Zhao is a great director and the MCU has some great movies but this is neither of their finest work."
2956,7,"A good visual experience Cinematography & Visuals are very good. The pace of the story is also up to the mark (Such long runtime doesn't let you bore). But as an MCU movie there's less action scenes, less one liner jokes than as usual, more focus on story telling. The character development was not good (Some characters are fully ignored).Other than some limitations, the movie establishes the future of MCU, so must watch."
2957,10,"The lowest rated marvel movie ever, is actually the most ambitious, emotional, and epic movie! I know the critics and people have a problem with this movie. I see why. It was the same thing with black widow, and there were things in that movie that upset me too, but that didn't stop me from giving it a 10 out of 10 and neither does this. This movie was so raw and beautiful and cinematically as well as visually stunning. The emotionally textured scale of this film is astonishing. We go on this journey with these eternal's who have hearts! And they grow and learn just like real people do! They fight for what they love. It is no different from any other MCU film except for the obvious, New actors, a new adventure, more mysteries and, CELESTIALS! I am not saying that this is the best MCU film ever, but it is the most epic of all. The actors showed how these Eternals are real people and I thank Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, and the rest of them for giving us a beautiful Sci-fi Journey! And most of all, I want to thank Chloe Zhao! Not everything she did was up to peoples expectations ( including my own ), but her work brought tears to my eyes and I will forever remember this. I will never forget the shock, the twists, and the experience in the theaters!! WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
2958,9,"An epic movie! This movie sets a new trend basing it's story on real stories written by the Sumerian people who lived in mesopotamia some 7000 years ago! Their stories written in clay or stone tablet's speak of an alien people who where called the Anunnaki which means (those from the heavens came to earth.) They speak of them as powerful god's who taught made, and nurtured them.. I was totally immersed in the story and graphics in this movie and feel it was casted perfectly. Must watch!"
2959,10,"People love to hate. It's a 7.5 but ive given it 10 to offset the whiners. This isn't a regular marvel movie. It provides enriched cinematography and dutifully examines the emotional temperament of each eternal, along with the nature of their existence.Eternals is essentially Marvel lore, its religion, and is treated as such. It's a fundamental keystone to the evolution of Marvels universe and is regarded as such. As is the case with most religions, there can be some boring parts. But they're only boring if you're wanting something more than emotional character development.This is a regular marvel movie because it has the responsibility of being something more. They've introduced wonderful memorable characters, enhanced the depth of the universe, and invigorated interest in the stories to come.If you're a real marvel fan, you'll understand the necessity of this type of story and will be excited to see how it ties into the rest of the universe in the stories to come."
2960,3,"Eternally long! I love marvel films but just recently they have been a hit or a miss. Shang Chi was a hit, Black widow a miss, Eternals unfortunately a miss too.I had my doubts when it started with paragraphs of onscreen text. No film should explain the story with text, the film should do this. Which it did a few minutes later anyway.It's so long for no reason, they could have easily lost an hour without loosing content or story. Some of the acting was great and others poor like the child Eternal. The writing/ directing was just lifeless and just not compelling in anyway.The editing seemed poor as well. I am sitting in a dark cinema and one scene will be so dark I can just about see what's happening. Then it will just cut to an outside shot with the sun glaring in from behind a character. Not just once but constantly throughout the film, just dark then overly bright then dark again.Effects were good but why should they not be in this day and age. Apart from the end credit scene with the dwarf guy, his cgi was some student quality stuff.To sum it up it was just quite dull and some what uneventful for all the potential it had. The bad evolving alien could have been so good but was just passed off like nothing and forgotten about."
2961,2,"Not only predictable.. Also nonsense What happens when you get a bunch of people trying to perform multiple narrative threads that you indicate happen over 7,000 years? A mess. I can't fault the actors but you absolutely can fault the writers.A summary of this film is hard to even make due to the stacked on top of each other events that all are supposed to culminate in a more emotional climax than physical one. But end up leaving you only half knowing half of the characters.Marvel continues to aim at larger threats, but use retcon methods to get there."
2962,10,"An intriguing surprise! I went in thinking I knew what I was getting, as the film has been reviewed and discussed so much. I thought I understood the film and what it did right (and possibly wrong) for various folks. I also thought I knew ""how"" it deviated from fhe Marvel formula, and what it would keep. I was wrong in so many ways, sometimes completely, and that was an intriguing feeling for a Marvel film.Because of some things I won't share here to avoid spoilers, there are very real stales in this film there aren't in many of the other Marvel ones. By the last third, I felt I had zero ability to predict what would happen with and to our heroes and villains and that was kind of awesome. I found myself invested in ways I am not in the standard Marvel film.I also thought, for some reason, that it wouldn't be funny. I had it my head it would be a serious drama, devoid of Marvel joy. That wasn't the case, at all. It was plenty funny (not a comedy, by any means, but it had a lot of lightness) and the vistas and action looked and felt so different from other films. It was clear they shot on real locations without as many worlds ""created"" with CGI and I really found that really enhanced my enjoyment.I also worried it would feel too crowded with that many movie stars needing to serviced with screentime and big moments. But that wasn't an issue. Some spend whole stretches completely off camera and that lets other parts of the story breathe without having to play everyone in every scene.I will say this is the kind of film you might need a few hours or a day to fully process. It asks big questions, zigs when you expected it to zag, and makes some choices that are story service more than fan service, and we aren't always used to not getting what we expect. And there are a lot of new characters to experience and think about. I almost wish reviewers didn't have to write their articles right afterward, because I wonder if some would have had more nuanced take after having some time. But either way this is definitely a film to see yourself and form your own opinion on, as it may very well feel as brilliant to you as it did to me.Oh, and I am looking forward to seeing where Kit Harrington's Dane Whitman goes next."
2963,9,"Visual Spectacular The Very First Lovable Aspect of the Movie is definitely gonna be Visuals. Every Charcter is Explored in a Dramatic Way and we will own the characters. Ofcourse the slow paced narration lead to some lags but it's definitely worth it. Unlike other Marvel Films, Eternals surely had different approach but the signature of Marvel Studios didn't scatter away...It had all elements that every marvel movie has. And the Performances are Strong and Astonishing. The Twists and Turns are the amazing parts in the film as they push the movie further. Finally it's a Landmark Marvel Film which has a great affect in Marvel Cinematic Universe."
2964,10,"Excellent movie - enjoyment I don't know why this movie gets hate or bad review. Excellent movie, and visual effects.The story is fantastic and the acting is on point. Top 3 Marvel movies from me. I don't know why people appreciate more Spiderman movies where the main character is a high school student who is more and more childish from film to film."
2965,7,"I wanted to like it more than I did I really wanted to like this film, and whilst I did think it was ""good"" (or ""okay""), it should have been ""great"". For a start, the film felt way too long, some parts dragged and there was just so much going on. It felt non-stop yet still managed to feel slow in parts. There were also so many plots constantly evolving that it made it difficult to fully appreciate any one given moment.The first half of the film was definitely more enjoyable for me than the latter half, though I do massively respect that they have at least tried to do something different here and not follow the MCU formula that so many follow.Pros: The Cast were awesome and all round i'd say the acting was pretty good.Plenty of likeable characters.Fight scenes were enjoyable.Some beautiful shots throughout.Cons: No real solid villain.Pacing was up & down and tbh... kinda off.Kind of killed off some of the more likeable characters? Felt like they shot themselves in the foot a bit for future installments.Kit harringtons character, whilst completely fine, kind of just felt shoehorned in.Wasted some of the ""bigger"" actors in my opinion."
2966,8,Well done Marvel! I'm excited for what's next (again) After the news building up to this film I was apprehensive to see whether the criticisms I was hearing were true and I am pleased to say I enjoyed the film more than I was expecting. This is a great MCU film.It was always going to be hard to introduce 10 new characters and give them all sufficient time to develop but I think the film managed it well enough with many of the key players in the story being given good development and I cared for many of the team by the end. My rating is as high as it is because I think Chloe Zhao does a great job at piecing the overflowing epic story together in a neat easy to follow (after the first 15 minutes) way which managed to surprise me in good ways as the story progressed.This is one of the most epic yet personal marvel stories out there with action scenes shot perfectly while also giving each character (except a couple) conflict and emotional drive.Please stay for the 2 end credit scenes which tease ever so slightly some future projects which I cannot wait to see.I will happily watch this movie again and I'm pleased to see representation of all types included in a film without it being made a thing. I hope this continues as part of the new normal of cinema.
2967,8,"Enjoyable But Not The Greatest I saw ""Eternals"", starring Gemma Chan-Captain Marvel, Crazy Rich Asians; Richard Madden-Rocketman, Game of Thrones_tv; Kumail Nanjiani-Stuber, Central Intelligence; Angelina Jolie-the Maleficent movies, Wanted and Salma Hayek-Like A Boss, Everly.This is a super hero movie that is based on some comic books created by Jack Kirby. It's been a while since I have read the original books but the premise goes something like this; The Celestials are space gods that are responsible for creating universes. The Eternals are super powered protectors of the Earth-sent by the Celestials-that fight the evil creatures called Deviants. Each Eternal has a different power and they are immortal. Salma/Ajak is their leader and other members include Gemma/Sersi, Richard/Ikaris, Kumail/Kingo and Angelina/Thena. The Eternals and the Deviants had a big battle some 7,000 years ago and the Eternals were victorious. The weary warriors went their separate ways and lived among the humans, gently influencing the humans' progress in technology-remember, being immortal, they don't age. In the present, the Deviants pop up again and the battles are once more joined. There are secrets that are uncovered-mostly about the Eternals real mission-and there is a tease of a future hero. There are 2 scenes at the end; just as the credits start-a relative of Thanos shows up-and after the end credits is the tease of a future hero in the next Eternals movie.It's rated ""PG-13"" for fantasy violence, action, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 37 minutes.It's not the greatest super hero movie-they are laying the ground work for future movies-but it was enjoyable. I would buy it on DVD."
2968,9,"Watch it for yourself The only thing ""bad"" about this movie is that they allowed people who claim to ""love the MCU"" watch it. Too many people are coming on here and acting like they know how to write a movie, the characters, their stories, and how to direct and make a movie. Watching a lot of movies doesn't make you an expert. This movie was great, was it different from other Marvel movies? Absolutely, but in a good way! I loved it, and so did my kids. It was a great cast of characters, and I feel like it's purpose in the MCU isn't late, like others have claimed. One thing about Marvel is they always make sure everything ties in together, they did it for 10yrs leading up to Endgame, I'm pretty sure they'll do it again. Honestly, don't bother with reading the reviews that are below an 8 because I guarantee they were either written before it came out, or it's just people trolling because they have nothing else better to do with their time."
2969,7,"Different Marvel movie Some elements make this movie unique in the MCU. The characters and their motivations are different from the traditional Marvel heroes and their stories are complicated, enormous and magnificent. The end opens a lot of new pathways for the Marvel Universe but the fact is that you understand that you are watching a MCU movie only when you see the post-credit scenes... I think that Eternals is much bigger and deeper than many other products of this Universe and it wants to tell us so many things. This is the kind of movie that you either love or hate."
2970,8,"Lengthy but wouldn't say Boring Yes! The movie is quite lengthy but also there are a lot of characters to explore. Would complain a bit about flashbacks, because I think it has too many of them. The movie is visually amazing as are all the actors. I think Marvel has taken an unconventional method to tell a story than just a usual origin story pattern."
2971,7,"Different from other MCU movies. Good movie. Has a very different vibe to other MCU movies and people looking for another End Game or Black Panther movie might not find it as ""entertaining"". However, I thought it was very good in its own right. Great visual, good and likeable characters and decent storyline."
2972,10,"It's not the BEST but it definitely doesn't deserve these horrible reviews, especially the 1 stars. I liked it and it's a refreshing experiment especially from Chloe Zhou and Marvel. The characters and visuals/designs were top notch. Pacing and overall storytelling could've been better, but I really really enjoyed it. It's just different. It's especially different from Marvel's usual. I like different, in fact, this is probably in the top 10 Marvel movies for me and I love Marvel. The cinematography is just really stunning throughout the movie and the characters were lovable, interesting, and made up most of the movie.Go watch it for yourself and make up your own mind though. Some people will enjoy it, some people won't like it. The few that hate it because of diversity and the people they chose to represent in it are childish and pathetic. It's honestly not bad and I would rate it at the top for people like me who likes visuals and characters and longer movies!!!"
2973,8,"Does it match the ambition of its title? Opening up with a Blade Runner-esque text prologue, Chloé Zhao's benefaction to the (quite eternally at this point) Marvel Cinematic Universe immediately pulls us into a beachside action set piece that establishes our colorful cast of heroes. This prologue segways into Time by Pink Floyd, the second time time the band has been utilized in the Marvel canon; and while the usage of popular classics has grown to cringe-inducing levels in the past several years, this fits both thematically and somewhat ironically. You truly feel that Time passes throughout the story as we follow ten cosmic beings who must face their destiny in saving Earth from their dastardly counterparts that resemble the aliens from A Quiet Place.It's suffice to say that the premise and first few minutes can immediately engage our audience even if the rest of the film isn't the sum of its parts. It's already apparent that Eternals may just be the most divisive MCU installment since Thor: The Dark World, but no need to worry: Eternals eclipses the latter in just about every sense. It isn't just that it brings sections of the universe full circle, it's that it utilizes Zhao's direction in its near three-hour runtime, and we can make even more sense of her overnight success from Nomadland. I was quite surprised by how much maturity has been brought to the universe, coming off the heels of Avengers: Endgame. In some ways this is a return to form to the early days of Iron Man when the creative forces that be were still trying to find their identity in the grand scheme of things, and Eternals on its own succeeded in many ways.Zhao bridges the B-movie allure of many modern super efforts (especially in its costumes) with her prestigious background- and its crowning achievement to be sung in many reviews will be Ben Davis's cinematography. What many will tell you about some of the genre hall-of fame films is where they illuminate the brightest is their ability to make you forget you're watching a superhero film, whether it'd be in writing or aesthetics. Eternals most certainly wins in the latter with its naturalistic locations, sightful evocations of isolation, storm clouds, you name it. One can most certainly believe the press notes of her influence from Terrence Malick. The battle sequences and effects are as appealing as some of Marvel's best films, and in some cases even more brutal.The Marvel Cinematic Universe may be diverse in characters and varying genres throughout the years; but none have transcended the supercapes genre like only a select few have. Sadly, even Eternals' geek roots are too obvious, and much of that comes from Marvel's usual brand of hit-and miss humor. It's understandable that in a generation of irony, many fans will want these movies breaded and buttered in self-deprecation and ""I know I'm watching a blockbuster"" mechanics; but here the results are uneven though thankfully not to Thor: The Dark World status eye-brow raising. One moment that comes close to that is during the climax and a decision with a character arc that partly amounts to a punchline.Despite some tonal deficiencies, one issue that certain critics have brought up, the runtime, is thankfully not much to differ. Instead of a breakneck speed, Zhao's direction takes its time to make every one of us care about the Eternals. So much so that a character tragedy is carefully concealed and makes way for much needed third-act tension.Like many other TV stars, Gemma Chan is one who had trouble translating her small-screen bed of roses to a silver one. Now she's played not one but two MCU characters (double-dipping in the comic book field is quite the trend amongst popular actors these days), and her turn as Sersi should be proof that she can lend herself to dramatic leads in the future. Her chemistry with Richard Madden's Ikaris is part of what makes them the ones who carry the cast on their shoulders; Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Kumail Nanjiani are all engaging and funny to varying results. Let's also not forget seasoned actresses Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie. The former makes the most of her limited screentime, and Mrs. Jolie is up there with our two leads as Thena. Fans will await for her return in a future installment.Eternals is at least half a leap forward for its respective universe in terms of maturity; a giant one in aesthetic, craftsmanship and representation; and a lateral move for Chloé Zhao's career. In a world of apples and oranges, prestigious films and blockbusters, she's another example of that you can commit to both. And let's also lay to rest the rumors of Disney bribing critics; recent Rotten Tomatoes history has showcased Dumbo, The Rise of Skywalker and Eternals- I can name more.RATING: 3 out of 4 stars."
2974,8,"Eternals review There was Amazing visuals and some good characters , however not much depth to the characters and was very slow paced. Although I enjoyed it and was very surprised with the end credits, I hope to see more development of characters in the future Eternal movies."
2975,4,"Pretty, but disappointing. This movie wasn't good, and that's not terribly surprising. The movie struggles with being part of a much larger universe, at times feeling like it should be just a stand alone, but with jarring references to the universe that feel out of place, forced, and often make little sense to that universe. There's no real, central villain, which makes it feel like several little movies that got mashed together. The visuals are as impressive as always, but the fights are boring, the plot is muddled, and by the last 30 minutes I just felt like it should have been over already. None of the characters are particularly interesting either, which is disappointing given the diversity of the powers, personalities, and even actors.I did think the internal reflection of one of the eternals at seeing the consequences of his own meddling in human affairs was really interesting, and provided at least some explanation for the Eternals choice to remain adherent to their non-intervention rule, but it is brief, left unexplored, and frankly feels like it was an after thought.The comedy doesn't land well either.Frankly, this is surprising given director Chloé Zhao's otherwise phenomenal quality of work. If her name weren't in the credits, I'd never have believed this mess was her work."
2976,7,"Originally a 7 but dropped it to a 6 Good movie did not care at all for the ridiculous post credit scene. You'll have to watch die yourself. Is this what Hollywood has come to?? I mean seriously.Other than that, the movie was not nearly as bad as critics were making it seem. The visuals were excellent, acting was good, action was well done and different. The story was a little over complicated, even though it was pretty simple. They made it more complicated than it had to be. It also was unpredictable for me for the most part. Definitely recommend for any marvel fan."
2977,7,Good solid story just needed more action Definitely worth a watch and would recommend it i think the movie will probably need a second watch to solidify my rating.I thought most of the eternals powers were mediocre and thought due to them being made by celestials they would be more durable in certain scenes. The movie done a good job to keep me interested till the end with a few surprises.
2978,5,"Could have been more interesting but it was visually appealing I think this film was way more hyped than it supposed to be, during the entire film I wasn't able to decide wether this film was a real time origin story and renunion or a normal action movie and I thing the love line was way too much for this. There could have been more action in it. The film brought more questions than answers and the answers were not statisfying for a fan. I know that this is the starter film for the 4th sequal but still.Overall it was long but an interesting film that made me think a bit but somehow it still attracted my interest to want to see the next movie about them."
2979,7,"Better than most are giving it credit Has a rough start, poor handling of exposition and some forced comedy but over all is really enjoyable. Refreshingly diverse in a very casual way that is going to get overlooked due to the mainly negative reaction. One of the best looking mcu features to date. It's not 'bad' it's just different!"
2980,10,"Do Not Listen to the Critic Reviews. Have an opinion by yourself EXTREME EXTREME EXTREME SPOILERSI loved the Film so much. The Acting from all of the cast is amazing. The cinematography and directing was fenomenal.Sersi, Druig, Makkari, Phastos, Thena, Gilgamesh, Dane Whitman, Kingo & Karun are stand out characters for me and I loved every moment with them in it. Sprite was a good character too but some of her actions made me not like her as much. I was so annoyed with Ikaris but for good reason, We were meant to. It is what the Director wanted. Salma Hayek's Ajak was killed off pretty quickly but was shown in several flashbacks which I liked. One death I was really upset with was Gilgamesh although I understand why this choice was made. One character who I think could have a bit more screentime was Bill Skarsgård's Kro, Kro was on screen a lot but not with Skarsgård's voice.One thing that is extremely sad is seeing this movie getting nuked with bad reviews because it features a Gay Couple, Several Characters of Ethnic Minority and a Deaf Actress. The Cast aren't just diverse for the sake of being diverse, They all act brilliantly and hope to see some of them again in the future.The film ends on a cliffhanger with Arishem stealing Sersi, Phastos and Kingo from earth.The two end credits are both very important for the future of the MCU. One of them shows Harry Styles as Eros/Star Fox/Thanos' Brother meeting the remaining Eternals who left earth (Thena, Druig and Makkari) And the other shows Dane Whitman opening a box with a sword in which obviously hints towards him becoming Black Knight, A voice can be heard off screen in this scene and it is Mahershala Ali as Blade.Overall I was extremely happy when leaving the cinema because this was a different kind of MCU, And definitely a good kind of different. I highly recommend watching this movie. BUT REMEMBER This is only my opinion of the movie, Make sure to watch it yourself and have your own opinions on it."
2981,8,Visually amazing As expected from Marvels. I love the diverse cast and the fact that they show more cultural awareness instead of going for same old safe action movie formula.
2982,8,"Brilliant film Don't listen to the bad reviews, was a very good watch and something very different from what the MCU has done. Showed great character development considering it was the first time we've seen them and the visuals of the movie were incredible."
2983,2,"Why change the canon of Eternals? Why? I did a bit of reading about the Eternals in the comics. Canonically, Sersi (Gemma Chan's character) has the on/off relationship with Makkari, not Ikaris. Ikaris is played by a white male in the movie. In the movie, Makkari is now a black woman with a hearing disability. In summary, Chloe Zhao literally rewrote canon so she could watch her white male and asian woman sex scene fantasies come true.The Latino leader was always hinted as being very close with the Asian character, and Zhou could have easily put in whatever romantic stuff she wanted there, but instead, both were killed off fairly early instead. Literally sounds like to me that Zhou had a diverse cast put so she can scream about how progressive she is, and then immediately has them killed off or emasculated so she can dominate the movie with her white male/asian female sex scene. Chloe Zang went out of her way to change the comics to push her white male fantasies. Diversity just for the sake of diversity. Typical Hollywood."
2984,10,"Great underrated movie A Refreshing diverse cast. A lot of fun to watch. Absolutely not the worst MCU movie like some seem to say, probably also not the best, but absolutely worth a watch."
2985,8,"Love it or hate it The reaction to this movie has been a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" outcry. I think the dividing line of responses is whether or not it fits the Marvel mega-action template and if that is okay or not. Just to deal with that question out of the gate, this does not fit the Marvel cookie cutter. There are a variety of differences. It is diverse in both casting and subject matter. The cast is international, multinational and multi-ethnic. We have our first openly gay superhero. We have our first hero who is deaf. We have our first hero to struggles with their mental health. All artfully and beautifully presented, in my opinion. This is not a single character's origin story. It is 10 characters' origin story spanning over 7,000 years, plus the introduction of 3 distinct and new species: Celestials, Eternals and Deviants. It also acknowledges superheroes from other universes, like the potshots at DC's Superman. There are also some Marvel staple components, humour, brilliant CGI, fight scenes and world weaving. This film is also beautiful, in its casting, cinematography, graphics and music. The story is rich and the immense timeline is artfully woven into small bites. There is also a deeper treatment of relationships and some mature but tasteful scenes. The draw for me was Marvel and the stellar cast, especially Gemma Chan, whose career I've been following for a long time, now (do yourself a favour and binge her filmography). I have to confess that when I left the theatre I wasn't sure how I felt about the movie. Then, I heard Rotten Tomatoes gave it the lowest of all ratings for a Marvel movie (49%) and the critics who saw early releases were brutal. But, I also read the positive reviews by ordinary theatre goers and in writing this, I've decided to give this film an 8 (great) out of 10 and, personally, I look forward to seeing it again. {Superhero Action Adventure}"
2986,9,"Amezing Movie It is a great movie, is different but in a good way. The problem isn't the typicall, and the problem isn't just a generall villian who just want to destroy the heroes. The moral question they have about their purpose is great. The only think that did not like me is that with that amount of characters are some who do not have enough time in the screen. Druig, Makkari, Phastos and Thena were my favorites."
2987,8,"I love having a COMPLETE understanding.. I know this movie got a lot of bad reviews but I actually enjoyed it. All too often, with lengthy films, you end up asking why or what or when or how. Everything was answered in this movie. I think the critics were looking for the typical Avengers movie what action about 10 minutes after it starts and just not ending. This movie took the time to explain the Eternals origin and why whoever did what they did. I was kind of sad about one character dying. I'm hoping since they were created, and had the ability to be created again and again, that he will come back with a fresh new memory. With all that being said, I loved the movie. I can't wait for the sequel because I think all the action that many are looking for will be in that one."
2988,8,"How Eternals Should Be I'm not gonna comment or review the complete movie here but I'm what I'm going to say is this is a refreshing add-on to Phase 4 of Avengers.Apart from a very well executed saga I had to say I was getting somewhat used to the repeating theme in most of the Marvel movies being fun, action, and lightweight - it's not a bad thing, but occasionally you need to deliver the story and the depth. Infinity war, End game and a few other movies in the previous series certainly delivered a lot of stories and emotions. There are one or two things Marvel can learn from DC as much there is a lot that DC movies can learn from Marvel. Comics do time to time require more depth, emotion and elaborated stories than just pure action and adventure.Eternals can't be Iron man style - let's agree on that point. Anyone, who has read some of the Eternals comics series would know this... it has more story and history than just pure action fun.Eternal is not without its faults but we need more of these in Marvel !!! Well done."
2989,8,"An immersive movie and a visual masterpiece! The movie was well-paced throughout its 157 min runtime. Visuals were just absolutely stunning and the cinematography felt fresh; but most importantly, the character build-ups were excellent along with a decent plot. I was looking forward to see how Chloé Zhao would handle the introduction of so many new characters in a single movie and I must say, she did a brilliant job. The movie, in its core, had a grand scale but still managed to keep the characters so grounded and emotionally relatable. It had everything from emotional and moral conflicts, to breathtaking visuals, humor, pleasant surprises, and strong antagonists. Without giving too much away, let's just say that the antagonists in this movie had compelling reasons for what they were doing. They had a grey moral compass (something a little bit similar to what made people love the character of ""Thanos"") and this is what made the plot so strong and emotionally engaging.Let's wrap up by saying that it is one of those movies where the critic scores mean absolutely nothing! (I could go on and keep asking questions about the credibility of these ""so-called critics"" but frankly, I don't care and neither should you.)Go watch the movie (preferably in IMAX 3D) and make your own opinion out of it. This is a good, if not the best, movie in the MCU franchise. It is a MARVEL movie; but it's so much more than that. :)"
2990,9,"Much better than what the critics are saying I never normally write reviews on here though after watching Eternals last night, and really enjoying it, believe it deserves a lot more praise than what the critics have been saying. Please go in there and make up your own minds. Thank you."
2991,5,"Lower the Expectations, Better the Movie!! For regular audience it would be an average watch.And for Marvel fans it's a bit disappointment .!!Quite a poor script with weak narration... but entire visuals, editing and detailing stood upto the Marvel's mark.!!And again movie proceeds with gripping screenplay till the end.Made sure audience are well aware of every detail.But still could be a bit better in cinematography, context of the scene doesn't fit the framing of the shots.Action episodes are excellent, and BGM was passable.Even with the entire star casting they couldn't bring Max. Potential out of them.First 40-50 mins of the film is just engaging and after the twist whole plot turns around, and proceeds on a predictable pace.It's would be a worthy watch if your expectations are set low.Definitely can't recommend you not to watch the movie, but just keep the bar low.Post & end credits brought much more excitement on their next project, hope this time everything goes well.Overall below average: 2.25/5."
2992,7,"Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest. Chloe Zhao is an amazing director but she wasn't the right fit for this movie. Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest.Clearly this film is taking a different approach than what we normally see in a MCU film.It seems out of place almost because of how different this story is delivered. The story was also a bit messy I thought, with the time jumps going back and forward making it confusing to tie loose ends. And it was also a weak story might I add, because I felt that there wasn't much excitement happening in the film, especially during the second act. There wasn't much development with many of the eternals, as it's too hard for a 2 hour 30min film to develop 10+ characters deep enough for audiences to feel some sort of emotion towards them.Yeah, there are scenes that just must be seen on the big screen, and the fact that it was shot in real locations says enough about the size of the film. The big cosmic scenes will make you feel small. It's shot with a massive scope, looking visually different and intimate. Chloé Zhao has a really unique visual stamp. The cinematography is georgeous!Personal favourites are Thena and Gilgamesh.I still recommend people to watch it, but don't go in with high expectations."
2993,7,"I loved it, but not without its flaws For a Marvel film, it's below the bar having a similar style to most others, being a comedic romp. Despite them, it manages to stand on its own in many other aspects and I throughly enjoyed it, for its weaknesses and all."
2994,5,"Another So-So Entry for Marvel First, to those who complained about the acting/cast, I guess we weren't watching the same movie, because that's the highlight of this film. Everyone put in a good performance. BUT... as I said, that's the highlight.The story... well, The Eternals, created by Kirby or not, never were a big draw in the marvel universe. So why choose them for a movie? They're really just a sideshow. They never lasted long. At least not as long as this movie felt. The director did a good job, but the pacing was horrible and the movie felt like it was five hours long. Especially the middle where things just go sooooooo sloooow. Another major problem is Kit Harrington is wasted. He's in the movie for maybe ten minutes. And they never really make clear that he is supposed to be/become the Black Knight. This main celestial, if he's so powerful, why can't he just create other celestials rather than drop them on planets that are then destroyed? Are we now going to see the island celestial in every single marvel movie? Or have it mentioned? Nice bit of diversity, but why would an alien being create a deaf Eternal? They don't even have ESP, so that was kind of a drop in logic. So far this year, marvel is 0-4 with me. Eternals, Shang-Chi, Venom, Black Widow. All movies I don't care if I never see again (and in Venom's case, won't see again.) Are they a victim of their own success? I notice from the below 7 rating on IMDB, that not even the Marvel Drones are saving this one."
2995,10,a literal masterpiece Angelina Jolie is the one and only true goddess of this planet and this move just prove how talented this woman is. I really loved Eternals from the first second i saw it in the theater. I'm really amazed by all of the details and the level of acting skills the cast has. I will definitely recommend this movie to my family and friends. I hope that I'll get the opportunity to see this move once again in the theater soon.
2996,10,"Phase 4 winning Felt a bit nervous waiting for this they are a part of MCU I didn't look into, I know I had long enough.It was blooming good, twist and turns, ups and down, easy to follow plot. Everything you need in a Marvel film.Each actor complimented each other, and the balance of comedy and action is there it's a new take on Avengers. There is a mid and end credit scene , no spoilers from me, but Enternal 2 looks a good cast .Don't read what the critics write they are paid to hate these films, but fans and fans who write about them love them for what they are a good film a few hours of escaping every day life."
2997,6,"Its okay Being a Marvel film, it doesn't stands out at all Infact in many moments the movie is gng ti dissappoint you... Cons: 1)Very pedictable- almost everything was predictable...If you watched the trailer more than once than you will get an idea about the meeting of Ajack and Ikaris.2) Why was Angelina Jolie's chracter inserted in the movie nd why was it given to Angelina. She is such a big actor then her chracter should have meant something. I honestly thought she would have a significant role in the end but I was dissappointed.3) Almost everyone predicted the Faith of Gilagamesh.4) Why was just Kingo missing from the final act. It made no sense.5) movie was slightly boring 6) No clear motives It is a One time watch."
2998,2,"A Disappointment Had high expectations I guess based from the past Marvel movies. It lacked the excitement compared to others and it made the movie feel long. It couldn't be saved by even it's well known cast. Shang-chi was a pleasant surprise even with a lesser known actor as lead I think Marvel should not be complacent that people will eat up their future Phase 4 movies after this just because it carries ""Marvel"" in it. They even included Starfox who by the way was acted so dull."
2999,1,"Not at the same level of MCU movies we used to see Visuals are great, the cast is also great and that's it for me.Eternals is a new addition to the MCU and especially after getting great movies in the last couple of years such as endgame, far from home and the newly-released chang-chi, we as fans were overhyped to see new heroes joining the MCU but the results were underwhelming ( at least for me ), why ?1. It has so many characters to be introduced in one movie which is quite complex for us to understand each one and the relationship between them.2. It's sooooo long and boring as we're watching these new characters that we're not used to3. It should've had more of that ""superhero"" feeling of other movies, this movie is different but not in a good way .. it has more focus on drama than action, the story is not that enjoyable, there are many scenes that had more time than it deserved which makes it quite boring and dull.Overall, any superhero movie should always focus on what it really matters for being a superhero movie, not so many characters, clear ambitions for every character that really make sense, more action and intense, interesting story that fits the longevity of the movie, not focusing too much on drama, romance, politics, adult contents ( whether it's LGBTQ or not, sex scenes ) or any other aspect that is not a main aspect of superhero movies ( not only for eternals or mcu films but for all superhero movies )."
3000,8,Something new for Marvel fans! So I went to see the movie having mix expectations given the mixed reviews and the now famous rotten tomato score but I am a marvel fan and I was hopefull that maybe it was not that bad. And oh my god it wasnt bad at all!So the best parts of the movie:amazing visual effectsinteresting characterscelestials verry well doneI liked the plot twist didn't see that comingWorst parts:Overall it is worth the time and I am glad we saw this new characters introduced but the next movie should do much better than this one to keep them going in the mcu.
3001,7,"An ""okay"" movie If I could, I would give it a 6,5, not a 7, but it wasn't that bad, it was just... Okay.Let me explain.I feel like this movie should have been a series, because - as many people have already said before me - it focuses not on the story, but on the characters. This movie is a character drama, which is nice and interesting - IF you 1. Know and 2. Like the characters. That's not the case here. The movie is reeally long, but at the same time, too short: too long, because there are empty, boring parts, too-long expositions, and short, because we don't have time to get to know these characters. It caused a lot of uncomfortable moments for me, because there were a few emotionally heavy scenes, where I felt basically nothing, thinking ""jeesh, that happened, I should be upset"".The story is quite simple, and honestly, kinda boring. I understand that the MCU wants us to love Earth and People in general, but it's getting increasingly difficult to stomach the ""oh, I must save the planet because I love it"" explanation for everything. It can't be the real motivation behind every single character. There was a nice twist towards the end of the movie, which I didn't expect, so that was at least worth it.The music is forgettable and bland, and the actors? Guys, we have some really BIG names here, but I swear, it looked like they either decided to pretend to not know how to act, or to overdo it to a ridiculous level. It just wasn't believable or authentic at all.Some people say that this is the most beautiful MCU movie - well, in my personal opinion, it's not. It has some nice and inspiring CGI moments, but also some embarrassingly bad ones, too.One last thing: the movie jumps between action sequences (which are OK) and weird, boring parts with my personal (not) favourites: flat jokes, long ""we're standing in a line to pose as superheroes"" expositions, and rom-com-like, (not) romantic moments between actors who don't have any chemistry (or facial expressions!) at all.So. I understand that the director wanted to do something different, and it's different, all right, but it could have been so, so much better."
3002,9,"Don't listen to critics reviews Is the film endgame no it's not and it's not trying to be! The actors fit the roles, there's a good amount of humour and emotion and the celestial part of the MCU has been expanded.I really enjoyed the film and hope the eternals carry on with sequels or mix in with the avengers or other superheroes within the universe."
3003,8,"Epic, philosophical and compelling. Unfair reviews won't stop Oscar winning Chloé Zhao in this powerful and diverse work. This movie definitely doesn't deserve all the hate it is receiving. I get that some people are used to fast paced superhero movies and have no patience for dialogues and slow script build ups; but I can't agree with them. Clhoé Zhao is magnificent here; all the ten characters evolve well and we attach to them and understand their motivations, the twists and turns the movie throws at us using the epic concepts are incredible and everything is visually convincing. Moreover, this is a breaking point for Marvel's formula; Eternals stretches the old recipe and, although it still has past elements, it focuses on telling the story in a more mature way. This is a philosophical movie and it goes beyond Marvel's lore to deal with humanity's unanswered questions and create a cosmic ecosystem; it deals with life and death, explores worlds and creation and uses a huge scale to infer its grandiosity. Don't listen to the bad reviews and go watch Eternals with an open mind, be ready to embark on an epic long story that requires attention and patience, just like great deep movies/series always did; Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones, etc. Beyond the amazing script and directing, Eternals is a mark for cinema diversity and inclusion; we finally have real people leading a Marvel blockbuster and minorities being respectfully represented; black, Indian, Korean, deaf, gay, immigrants with real immigrant accents. The importance of ethnic and cultural representation is enormous and it is already resulting in the banning of the movie in many countries; and don't get me wrong, but this is great! Marvel is affronting prejudice all over the globe. Although all the actors are incredible and everyone will have their favorites, I have to highlight mine; Brian Tyree Henry and Kumail Nanjiani are brilliant here and I want to see more of them. Overall Eternals is a great movie, very well structured with an ambitious script and a huge importance for Hollywood's scenario today."
3004,9,"A Breath of Fresh Air for the MCU I loved Eternals. Holy crap the critics REALLY got this one wrong. It's a solid masterpiece of a movie and one of the most beautiful, unique and innovative films that Marvel has ever produced, thanks to Chloe Zhao's visionary talent. It isn't your average Marvel movie, hell it doesn't even feel like one. And that's why I love it! It's a breath of fresh air and shows the MCU taking bold, new risks, instead of just using the same type of storytelling. I love the creative choices that were made and how they all make it stand out in such a special way from the rest of the MCU, from the dense mythology, gorgeous visuals and more emotional, character driven storyline. It really taps in to the work of Jack Kirby, from a story and even visual perspective. This movie is still blowing my mind, its one that is getting better and better the more I think about, process and digest it, and I'm sure it will only get better with more viewings! (And god I cannot wait to see it again!) The film is ambitious, but handles everything so perfectly, which Chloe Zhao deserves every praise for! Her direction is stunningly beautiful, incredibly strong and she brings her very nuanced style to the MCU. I love how she puts story and character above the action, and while not one of the action is as big as some sequences from other films, what we get really works for the story! The film has a scope that is so ambitious and epic, feeling a lot like Zack Snyder's Justice League, which for me is a great thing. Zhao's script is also really well done, the mythology is rich and complex, the story is emotional, pure and heartfelt with so much humanity imbued into the characters. The characters were really fantastic and I fell in love with all of them very quickly. I really liked how the movie made every character feel important and valued, and with a cast of 10 main characters I found Zhao balanced their screen time and actions/conflicts really well. One of the best parts of the film is the dynamics and interplay between the characters. The Eternals are all essentially gods, but Zhao, alongside her stunning cast, did such a good job at bringing the humanity to each of their personalities and stories. It's a complex story with differing character motivations and ideologies, and I loved how the end battle was essentially a battle of ideologies as the Eternals sought to develop their own sense of autonomy from the Celestials. I also thought some of the dialogue at the start was a little iffy, but as the movie got going it got better. I loved the humour throughout, there were many really funny moments for sure! And like I said, the cast was perfect, each of the actors brought a warmth and sense of life to their roles. I especially loved Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Madden and Brian Tyree Henry, but it was clearly Gemma Chan's movie. Barry Keoghan was also such a surprise! Kit Harington had a smaller role than expected but I am so excited to see where his character goes moving forward! And that's another thing I loved about the movie; it reinvigorated my excitement for the future of the MCU and showed me how different and new it could get! The world building in the film is excellent, it really fleshes out the cosmic side of the MCU in such a rich and intricate way, making the MCU feel much more grand and complex. The movie essentially is what Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" wishes it was, and tells that sort of story but from the perspective of the engineers, which in this movie were the Celestials. I loved how they handled the Celestial scenes, especially in how they showed the physical scale and massiveness of Arishem compared to Ajax and Sersi. The visuals themselves, throughout the entire movie, are absolutely stunning and gorgeous. Chloe Zhao is truly gifted with a sense to capture the perfect shot, with stunning lighting and colour. Its easily the best looking MCU film, and I loved the natural feel that the on-location shooting did for the film. Its truly a feast for the eyes and felt so visually rich because it wasn't all CGI environments and was so brightly lit. I really admire the effort put into the cinematography for this film, and even the CGI looked stunning! The costumes also looked excellent and were nicely colourful! The design of the deviants was really cool, but unfortunately the characters themselves are somewhat wasted and served as better plot devices than villains, but luckily the story has a clever twist later on in the film. The overall villains of the movie are a lot more ambiguous than in a usual comic book movie, and that really worked for me. I really enjoyed the hell out of this movie, and I have to say it is definitely one of the best films that Marvel has ever produced. It doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, it is very much a Chloe Zhao film and that is easily its biggest strength! Please go see it and form your own opinions, I can see how some may see it as divisive, but I was completely swept away by it! It's a triumph; a slow burning story that is epic in nature, beautiful in character development, and has gorgeous visuals. It's something the MCU hasn't seen yet, and has major implications for the future. I respect it alone for the bold creative risks Marvel took in making this film, and hope we see more experimentation from them like this! Not only that, but wow Chloe Zhao is truly a force of nature and proves she can handle a blockbuster! I loved it, its so fresh and really something truly special and transformative for Marvel, and wow it only gets better with time! (And woah, those end credit scenes were pretty exciting!)"
3005,8,"So much deeper than other marvel projects. This movie is a bit different than other marvel projects that we use to see. The plot is deep and includes the same ""moral problems"" that Loki show had (Free will, purpose of existence, doing bad things for ""greater good"").Its not esthetically the best movie but cgi was good. Some characters and scenes were unnecessary, the movie would still make sense without some of them.It was a great movie, its just not every marvel fan's cup of tea due to lack of action and the plot continuing a bit slow. Still I like the movie a lot."
3006,6,"Another cog in the Marvel machine How is it that Chloé Zhao's previous film ""Nomadland,"" about a woman wandering the Midwest in a van, is more interesting and full of life than a $200 million blockbuster filled with literal gods?Both a coincidence and not a coincidence, ""Eternals"" and ""Dune"" share the same release window and many of the same elements. Both are technically well-crafted and beautiful films done on an epic scale featuring diversely interesting casts. Both cover vast amounts of space and time in attempts at worldbuilding for future sequels. And both share an emptiness on the page that keeps them from surviving anywhere past their runtimes. It's a shame that prestigious filmmakers like Chloé Zhao and Denis Villeneuve chose to make their least interesting films at the same time.But before I reveal my hand too early, let's back things up to the beginning of time, literally. ""In the beginning...,"" reads the opening crawl, a Celestial by the name of Arishem created the universe and all living things that inhabit it. Like the story in the Bible, this god was not perfect, as he created a monstrous race known as the ""Deviants"" that threatened the natural order of life. To right his wrong, Arishem created the ""Eternals"" to wipe out the Deviants and bring peace. For 7,000 years the Eternals have been Earth's watchful protectors, subtly guiding humanity to what it is today.But Arishem's imperfection begins to sow seeds of doubt within the Eternals. That doubt leads them to discover the real reason they have been dispatched to this planet, which is to prepare it for the ""emergence"" that would bring about the end of humanity. Do the Eternals go against their maker by preventing his grand plan, or do they sacrifice billions for the idea of the greater good?Just on paper, ""Eternals"" is Marvel's biggest feature to date in terms of scope and possibility. About a dozen new characters are introduced, all with unique powers. There's one with super speed, one that can control minds, and another that flies around and shoots laser beams out of his eyes like Superman (a reference made more times than you would think within the film).Marvel has always had a gift when it comes to casting their famed superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. Being cast as Iron Man was seen as an unnecessary gamble, and more eyebrows were raised when unknowns Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were cast as Thor and Loki, respectively. Just two months ago, Simu Liu proved all the doubters wrong with his terrific turn as Shang-Chi.But while all those risks have paid off, this large bet doesn't bring back the expected return on investment. A few names, like Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and Angelina Jolie are either miscast or not good enough for their roles. And for those that are good, such as Gemma Chan as Sersi and Richard Madden as Ikaris, their characters are too flat to inspire anything memorable about them except their names and what powers they have.But there are a few wins within this cast that should be championed, such as the first hearing-impaired superhero in Makkari, and the first openly gay couple in Phastos and Ben. There's also the first Marvel sex scene, lasting all of eight seconds. While celebration should be in order, these inclusionary acts are still baby steps for the Mouse House, who have always embodied the urban dictionary term of ""passive progressive.""""Eternals"" is also the most interesting Marvel movie on a purely technical level. That's not to say it's the best, but that it's different in a refreshing way. Zhao, newly armed with Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, makes the most radical departure from the plastic formula that has engulfed this franchise for the better part of its life. Along with DP Ben Davis (who also shot the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" as well as ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Captain Marvel"") Zhao leans for a desaturated, naturalistic look, similar to that of her previous features. The plains of South Dakota and the jungles of the Amazon are filled with beauty as she always seems to find and harness the magic hourBut those moments of visual originality are brief and sporadic. Once the special effects and action set pieces inevitably barge their back way in, it's back to business as usual.This bait-and-switch act begs the question: If even the most independent-minded filmmaker like Zhao can't break free from the corporate chains, who can? It's a question that I don't want to think about, as the answer is the one I fear the most: nobody can. That gloominess I feel may not be shared by those that have stayed loyal to this rewarding franchise. For those that came into this clinging on to the last bits of hope that someone could shake things up, this movie may very well be the death knell to that. But at the end of the day, did I truly expect anything different in Marvel's 26th entry?"
3007,6,"Should have been a streaming show Eternals should have been a streaming show. They could have slowed it down and took their time with all the people and it would have been way better. They could have intro everyone instead of just bunching them together and then ""here! Here! Here!"" But if you are not a comic book fan and you don't like knowing everything about what the MCU has connected to it. Then don't see Eternals. Its not the worst but nothing i would show someone to draw them into my comic movies."
3008,8,"It was just beginning.. Since 2019 SDCC, i had big hopes about Eternals. I didn't failure but I expected much more galactic scenes and historical events. But i can feel, we will see much more in the sequel.My favorite eternal always been Ikaris and he always will be. Watching Richard Madden's emotions, movements, actually just himself was amazing. But i think he deserved much better. It can't be real end for him. So, I believe he will return much stronger.Last action scenes with Ikaris, I got Omni-man hype and I loved it.. His fight with Eternals was so sick, especially with Thena and Makkari..Damn..I never supported Sersi-lkaris relationship since i learned they will be together. Im glad to I didn't. Cuz they don't have any common..Sprite's unrequited love for Ikaris made me sad. And with that The Tinkerbell reference was so meaningful for me as a peter pan fan. :)In the after credits, Harry Styles's Starfox was looking amazing and his energy already made me love him. Can't wait to see him in the future.. And of course Kit Harington's Black Knight too.."
3009,7,"Not an Avengers movie, but most people expect it to be First of all, the movie is good. All those low ratings because it is slow paced, only shows that people who like superhero movies have forgotten how it is at the beginning after watching known characters for so long. They were expeting another Avengers movie. The slower rythm is necessary to let us know the characters/heroes that we are meeting for the first time.Zhao's style is much different than the Russo's brothers, it is somber but still beautiful. The characters are great, it has some humor, like any other Marvel movie.But, I strongly believe that the Eternals movie should have been divided into 2. The first one to introduce the characters and their internal struggles through out time, making us relate more to them and care about their fate. The second one beginning the moment that they separate until today with all the action and etc... Go watch with an open mind and heart."
3010,9,"Will be remembered as a masterpiece After seeing it twice, I can't think of another MCU film that crossed off this many boxes. The characters were fully fleshed and I became connected with them. There was real consequence and gamble. Something Shan-Chi fell very short of.This movie was a film. A beautiful, deep, well told film.Super excited what is to come in the MCU and hope they're able to expand in what has been established in this film."
3011,8,"Stunning Visual Art Film Eternals is a Stunning Colourful Visual Art Film, Lovable characters and a very diverse cast.An entertaining Film, Really Enjoyed it, But I don't think it for everyone.It open's up more of the Marvel Universe. Learn about past and a vision into future events."
3012,9,"Astonishing work of art Where do I even begin?Never have I been so perplexed by a movie's critic score.The visuals were breathtaking, and the action set pieces were glorious. It's the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, period.The score...my oh my...Ramin Djawadi's done it again. Brilliant. And the pacing is much better than I'd feared, considering the movie is 2.5hours long. Big plus for the diverse cast as well.The movie masterfully portrays its central themes of Purpose, Fate and Freewill, which are aided by the exceptional acting of the stars. It's definitely the most philosophical Marvel has ever dared to get.By the time the credits rolled, I was dawned by the satisfying epiphany that I was enthralled throughout the film, and not distracted by the sometimes forced comedy and prolonged action scenes that we've come to expect from some Marvel movies. Heck, it's not _just_ a marvel movie, it's a grand sci-fi epic, that's meant to be enjoyed on the biggest screen possible. Which is why it's probably my favorite one yet. It's Big, Bold, and emotionally resonant. I cannot wait to see what the Director Chloé Zhao does with the characters next.I can see why some people might not Love it, but I can vehemently proclaim that the low ratings are unwarranted! It definitely feels targeted.Ultimately, this is just my opinion, don't take it as gospel. Go watch it and form your own opinion."
3013,8,"Eternal surprise I went to this movie not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. Good storytelling and skillful direction kept my interest throughout. It referenced a number of other movies like LOTR and Highlander with a hint American Gods that took it beyond some of the more mundane themes of other Marvel movies. Also cleverly laid a lot of false trails as to who the baddy was. Visually quite beautiful in many aspects and a strong tight cast really made it work for me. Came out with a definite ""Yes"" on my lips."
3014,10,Have no idea how this is getting bad reviews Went into this movie very worried from reading the reviews beforehand. I was waiting for the entire move for something to go wrong with it and nothing did. Easily in my top 5 MCU movies and Chloe Zhao did a terrific job.Only gripe I had with the film is Sprite's ending. It makes sense they had to do that to explain the actress aging for future projects but the way they did it was sub par.
3015,7,"A new direction for Marvel It's a lot of mystical fun on an extremely large scale. The cast is absolutely top-notch and what the story sets up had me on the edge of my seat. Although, Eternals does get bogged down by some big ideas that weren't quite executed well. The Deviants are the villain and it felt like they're only purpose was to provide action scenes. Which granted, we're a lot of fun. Eternals is must-see Marvel movie, whether it's in theaters or wait a couple months for Disney+"
3016,8,"Splendid and DEFINITELY worth a watch Star Packed, Vivid, Diverse, Emotional and Plot HeavyThe movie is pretty great, beautiful visuals on point acting and a diverse cast, Manages to capture the agony and problems faced by the eternals and I think the casting team should definitely be given a raise considering how great the ensemble they have put together. Richard Madden's flying scenes seem so natural and I don't think anyone could play ikarus better he is probably a plus point of the movie. AJ is just beautiful and Thena is probably the most badass eternal. End credits set up the future of the MCU pretty well though I am not a fan of him (trying to keep it spoiler free) most would be pretty pleased with his casting. But it does feel a little slow at times and the repeated flashbacks don't help it but it does not hurt to watch and at no point do you feel that it's too long. Review bombing (due to LGBTQ rep) even before it's release has made every one lose interest from it and yes its not the conventional marvel movie with intense action but Chloe Zhao s vision can be seen through this film she has prefered to keep the movie more focused on the plot instead of the action not that the movie has bad action scenes. She has shown characters with more emotional depth and a plot that focuses on the human nature of the eternals rather than only action and comedic one liners in between fights. Another problem that some might feel with the movie is the lack of character development, well somewhat true because you don't feel the connect you should have felt with Ajak and Gilgamesh but I think that's because we have become accustomed to marvel series but in let's say Avengers (2012) we didn't know much about all the members of the the team until much later when they got their solo movies. We didn't know anything about black widow until this year. So I think we will get to know more about character s like Thena and Druig atleast in the next part (hopefully)."
3017,10,"Loved every second of it Movie was pretty great. What do you expect from Disney/Marvel. I can see this movie getting hate from the straight marvel guys lol women director, gay love, romance. You know everything they will hate on lol."
3018,8,"What a wonderful epic! After living for a very long time on earth, each eternal is going through their own emotions and its directed very well. Beautiful visuals and heartbreaking scenes takes the movie closer to the heart."
3019,7,"Not bad Not the best MCU movie nor the worst. I definitely expect more with such a great cast and approach to a new set of characters to the MCU. The cast was great. Great performance, but I can definitely agree with some of y'all that the story line was missing. It didn't keep me excited and anxious to what was going to happen like the other movies. The characters and the movie had so much potential to develop into something but it didn't. Definitely worth a watch. Maybe part 2 will be better. Definitely opens the doors to the new phase of MSU."
3020,8,"A stepping stone.. Welcome to Phase 4 The movie has some great visuals and fights to offer. It's quite diverse and has an own taste to it. It's true it feels a bit paced but it can't be helped...afterall introducing 10 new heroes and bunch of ther super characters like deviants and celestials all in 156 min is no joke. I really hope you view this movie not just because of its solo entertainment but as foundation for the entire phase 4 and once you realise it, it all comes to play. Finally the plot is very wide so I'm really excited to see what all the eternals have to offer in future. Hey, they are returning afterall😎"
3021,9,Soul of Marvel Cinematic Universe Managed to see #Eternals and I must say it is the best Marvel movie.It might lack the usual tropes and humour but it makes that up by being soul of Marvel universe. The movie questions morality and puts humanity under microscope.It is a brilliant cinema experience. Great cinematography and you can see Chloe Zhao's touch in the movie. An artistic direction with a brilliant human element. Great acting and what a wonderful diverse cast bringing individuality in the Marvel universe.
3022,10,"Beautiful cinematography Sure it has it flaws, but it's far from the worse MCU movie or a 'disaster'. Cinematography and action are definitely some of the best in MCU. I really enjoyed the movie and i don't find the flashback scenes confusing. The story of each characters are also very interesting to me. Really nice to see the MCU expands in this direction. So many stories going forward on a different scale. I hope they get to explore this side of the universe more in the future!"
3023,9,"A new world of Marvel A very enjoyable movie. There are many characters to introduce for the first time on screen but this is handled surprisingly well. This is a very character-driven movie and the cast enable this movie to thrive. Despite there being a lot information thrown at you throughout, before too much complexity in the plot is revealed, the movie allows viewers to get used to all of the characters and their relationships with one another. On top of all of this the movie is absolutely beautiful. On another note, It is very interesting to have a movie stray from the ""Marvel formula"" but it works well and I look forward to seeing where they take these characters in the future."
3024,7,"Overall pretty good It was good, not great. The first two acts were very entertaining and kept me on my toes as to what was coming next. The relationships and group dynamic was refreshing and very nice. In the third act the plot gets messy. Too many bad guys aid plot point they were trying to hit. It would have benefited from another half hour. Over all, very entertaining but in no way my favorite Marvel movie."
3025,1,"Boring, all over the place, and the good guys may really be the bad guys The diversity isn't the problem, but diversity alone, does not a movie make.It's 2 hours and 45 minutes of extremely low energy and boring emoting, un-engaging CGI action, and the plot is all over the place.A waste of the cumulative talent pooled, that could have made 5 separate good movies, instead of this one jumbled mess."
3026,7,"A Imperfect, Solid MCU Film After over a decade of movies and the beginning of television wiggling its way into this universe as well, The Marvel Cinematic Universe is simply one of the most impressive franchises of all time. That's not to say it's the best franchise of all time, just incredibly ambitious without stumbling very often. Eternals is the first film in a very long time, to be this ambitious in introducing this many characters at once. Yes, this is a downside to the film overall, but I really enjoyed watching it. From the terrific direction to the beautiful look and feel, here's why I think Eternals is worth your time, even if you might be someone who won't like it as much as I did.To put it as simply as possible, there are beings known as Celestials. The Celestials are responsible for the creation of all living things in the Universe. Using these powers thousands of years ago, they created a small race known as Eternals. They were placed in our Universe to oversee human existence and only interfere with any conflicts if creatures known as Deviants ever were to arise. Thousands of years later, in the present day, something has awoken them. Needing to get the band back together, this film is purely about the reassemblance of the Eternals in order to stop this looming threat.That description may seem like it makes for a super exciting time at the movies, but please don't go into the film expecting non-stop action like Avengers: Infinity War. This is a film that takes its time, flashing back and forth, teaching you the backstory of these characters so that you care about the consequences moving forward. Chloe Zhao's direction here is very much her style and it's very apparent that she was given the freedom of bringing her tone to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The strongest point of this film is the fact that everyone is likeable. Everyone is given just enough time to make an impact, even though I think more time with each of these characters would've helped it a lot more.Leading up to The Avengers back in 2012, we had films that developed each of the core characters first. This is a film that was trying to bring a team together with far less time and far more characters to boot. It's nearly three hours long, but there are times when it honestly feels like a couple more hours could've helped it. I'm starting to think this story would've worked much better as a Disney+ series that's still connected to this world, but I understand that the ideas presented here were necessary to be seen by a larger audience. This was a huge problem I had with the film, but that aside, I still really liked it.My issue with the characters would've been a lot greater, however, if it wasn't for all of the performers making me care about them. Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan were probably the biggest standouts to me, all providing a bit more depth than the rest of the cast, but everyone brought their A-Game here and it showed on-screen. On top of the great cast, there are spectacular visuals that are unlike those from other Marvel films. Yes, the CGI creatures and things of that nature are all still present here, but the CGI backgrounds and landscapes all felt very real this time. I really enjoyed the attention to detail when it came to that.In the end, Eternals both feels like a traditional Marvel Cinematic Universe film while also doing things that this franchise hasn't done before. The drab tone, slow pacing, and overall ""Epic"" feel (especially with its runtime) all worked incredibly well for me. I just wish this story had more time to breathe, even with being nearly three hours. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a necessary watch, given the ramifications, this will likely have on the franchise as a whole. As big as this movie feels, I think it only scratched the surface. It's far from perfect, but even with its flaws, this movie really worked for me. Eternals is now playing in theatres and I think it's worth seeing."
3027,6,"Eternals could be less complicated if it wasn't part of Marvel I can understand why critics are treating Eternals a bit too harshly. Eternals is very different from all the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, at the same time, it attempts to maintain the basic structure of its other recent films. The critics expected to see a basic Marvel movie, but they did not meet their full expectations. That makes Eternals difficult to please most Marvel fans. However, I can praise the film for a couple of things. The acting is good and I'm proud of Marvel for having diversity in its cast. The film score is gorgeous and doesn't sound like any other Marvel scores. The cinematography is excellent in many shots; however, a few shots in the movie involved using a green screen, and the cinematography didn't blend well with it. Another problem with the film is that most of the characterization is weak. Kit Harington's character is the most pointless of all characters in the film as he only appears for a few minutes at the beginning of the film and isn't seen again until the end. The post-credits scene showcases some information about his character that will be explored at some point in the MCU, but it felt like something that could've been saved for another movie. Despite being the biggest celebrity in the film, Angelina Jolie also didn't get enough screen time or character development. The screenplay is probably the most flawed screenplay of all MCU movies. It has too much exposition; the characters explain too much information instead of letting the movie show. I get that the film needed some explanations since many people are unfamiliar with the Eternals, but it could've been executed much better. There's also a lot of flashbacks in the film, most parts of which serve as filler. While it does help us learn more about the characters, there were still some bits that could've been cut. In fact, most of this film seems like it tried to cram so much about the Eternals into one movie instead of giving it all to us by dividing it into thirds like most Marvel trilogies. If that doesn't make sense to you, imagine for a minute that Marvel never existed, but suddenly a movie called Avengers: Infinity War comes out. That's exactly what Eternals feels like. I know Tony Stark once said, ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk,"" but that does not apply to the process of creating a movie franchise. With that said, Eternals is going to be challenging to build a trilogy upon. The end of this film does tease a sequel, but I can picture this planned series going down the path of the Divergent films. In other words, I find it hard to imagine the sequel(s) maintaining its audience. I would like to see the Eternals as a team appear in future Marvel movies, but if we're giving them their own movies, they'll have to take a different direction to stay consistent."
3028,8,"Brilliantly Different Film for the MCU A vastly different entry into the MCU but one that took me for a ride. It's impressive feat to take on a 10 lead character based film, it's another thing to make you care about every single one of them. Chloe Zhao has already shown us her talent with smaller films, and it's even more telling on a massive MCU scale that she's here to stay. It's hard to say what the best 2021 MCU film is at this point but Eternals has certainly made it's stamp on me. I had a blast.8.8/10."
3029,9,"An isolated, A bit flawed but heartfelt entry into mcu This movie is visually stunning, well put together ( for it's own story and scope size ) with surprisingly heartfelt, real emotional moments. Only shortcoming is this movie tackles too much of a story in one swoop and it felt a little bit out of blue ( the cosmic side of mcu ). It is more layered story and it will come into picture in future. I saw the low critical score this movie got across all the flatforms and I thought may be this movie is bad but I'm wrong. It just tackles a different variety of story and didn't succeed all the way. It is an experiment and be patient with it to bare the fruits."
3030,8,"Scope, Scale, and 4 Huge Character Reveals... The supposed hate for this film has to be chalked up to a whole lot of ""special interest"" twits who hadn't even seen it yet. This was a beautiful epic from the Celestial opening, to the closing, off-screen dialogue.This. Film. Is. Grand! Any doubt as to whether the scale would feel enormous enough was crushed in moments and rode through the entire movie. You're faced with the very human flaws of godlike characters, that don't stray from being fragile, even while leveling landscapes. Power resonates in every aspect, but it's the nuanced performances that standout (huge props to Don Lee and Bryan Tyree Henry, specifically who supply steadfast heart throughout). Two and a half hours went by like a blip, with only minor notes given for a couple pacing issues, but pushing an ensemble cast that large has its hurdles. For the first time in a while the injection of humour doesn't seem forced, or childlike, in an MCU film, which rests squarely of the jacked shoulders of Kumail Nanjiani and the brilliantly human Harish Patel!Eternals hits like new mythology, and doesn't back off with gigantic reveals for the MCU, as well as offhanded resettings of the status quo. Put simply: Chloé Zhao gave you an epic, minus a few minor stumbles, that is undeniably beautiful, and will remind you what it means to feel small."
3031,10,Not as bad as people make it out to be. Overall the movie was not that bad compared to how bad Shang Chi. The story could've been better not trying to spoil anything but the deviants seemed like a side story the whole time. The movie had multiple additions to new characters to the MCU. It didn't play by the typical marvel rules and was definitely something different. Worth the watch and is definitely is over hated.
3032,10,"Entertaining and visually stunning I dont know what you maniancs are talking about! This movie has everything, a great story (each of the characters has its own personality, development and motives), great visuals, amazing fighting scenes, good sex scenes, diversity, jokes (are kinda meh?) and last but not least it opens up alot of posibilities for the future of Eternals in the MCU."
3033,8,"Pretty darn good, some issues but overall good Some reviewers are saying the stakes are too small. I guess they missed the part where the Earth would literally blow up and everyone on the planet will die in order for a Celestial to be born. Guess that isn't big enough. Some are saying the characters are confusing when they literally spell out why they did the things they did. Some of the editing and pacing is a little off, they definitely could have done better in that regard, but overall the story is straightforward and easy to follow. Genuinely curious if people payed attention to the movie, or if their attention span is too small to comprehend what is going on. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of explaining in this movie, but I feel they do a good job telling the story. To me this movie doesn't deserve the hate it is getting."
3034,7,"Would've been better as a duology The film is good. The visuals are stunning, the storylline is okay and continues the trend of expanding the Marvel universe. However, it does feel like a duology crammed into one film with a LOT of exposition. The trailer gave the impression of doing a good job balancing the past of the eternals and the present but the execution lacked soul. It lacked the energy of an avengers level, star studded, big budget CGI type movie, however the third act did a good job with that. While the threat seemed very real and magnanimous, it lacked in engaging the audience as much as i had hoped. The biggest let down is the underutilisation of the use of powers. It really feels like even the Avengers could defeat them whereas in reality they are far more powerful. Here's a quick spoiler-free rundown of the plus points and down points of the characters: Madden's Ikaris is powerful and it shows, however his full potential is not really explored. And yes, Superman from DC would easily defeat him, no cap.Jolie's Thena and Dong-Seok's Gilgamesh have really engaging action sequences but lacks the soul of an Eternal.Chan's Sersei has been executed really well where her true potential is explored throughout the film.Henry's Phastos' real potential is explored and is a treat to watch.Hayek's Ajak is a let down.McHugh's Sprite takes you through an emotional journey and has been executed pretty well.Ridloff's Marraki steals the show when she appears and is really powerful.Nanjiani's Kingo is a well executed character who also serves as a comic relief along with Patel's Karun but is a let down in the third act.Keoghan's Druig is by far my favourite character in the movie. Although he is no match for most of the characters in combat scenario, he is a really well executed character and will make you root for him."
3035,10,Well done marvel! The best marvel movie so far! The story is amazing and it just took marvel to a new higher level and I look forward to seeing where it's headed. The diversity is amazing and it's exactly what we needed! It's so diverse and makes Marvel univers now more interesting !
3036,8,"I need an explanation... After seeing the critic reviews, I was expecting a mixed bag from the movie when I walked in. Though, I'd still give it a chance as I'm a big fan of the MCU. If it's bad, whatever, I didn't care for the Eternals in the comics anyway.So the movie starts off and during the first 30 minutes or so, I thought there was some pacing issues and I got a little worried that the critics were right, but once the movie settled, I was locked in. I found myself really enjoying the movie. I was then anticipating this moment where the movie falls off the rails to explain the reviews...but that moment never came for me. Actually, I found the movie continuing to get better. The story was growing on me, the characters were growing on me, the action was growing on me. Then the movie ended. I was completely confused what was wrong with the movie. I remember seeing some reviews saying they were bored. So knowing Chloe Zhao as a director, I thought maybe there wasn't much action or humor, but there was plenty of action and humor. The message and stakes of the movie was nice, and I thought it had good emotion to it. Now, I don't think it's a masterpiece, and there was a lot to take in, but I never found myself confused or uninterested. Maybe for the casual movie goer, it's a little too much superhero for them, but so are other MCU movies. I think Eternals might even be more Sci-Fi than most Marvel movies. Either way, the movie is a good time regardless of what critics say.I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact this movie is currently in the 50s on Rotten Tomatoes. To put it in perspective, Venom: Let There be Carnage has a 60%...I really just feel bad for the people that worked on this movie...they should be proud of it instead of seeing so many negative reviews."
3037,8,"Don't listen to ""critics"" I went into it not knowing much about Eternals other than it ranked close to Thor 2. I highly disagree. It entertained and satisfied. Judge for yourself."
3038,4,"Honestly... It was mediocre at best, I wouldn not watch it again but the cinematography was great. It just took its too seriously for a superhero movie & was boring at times."
3039,9,"I need 7-10 business days at least to recover This film is genuinely so incredible, I don't really know how best to describe it. The plot is so well written and the film is brilliantly directed. The cast were all fantastic and the characters were also brilliantly written.I adore the diversity of this film, not only as a Marvel film but comparatively to most blockbuster films, Eternals is incredible. The inclusion of so many different people was so beautiful to watch and it makes me so appreciative of the direction Phase 4 is heading towards.I don't know what else to say except OMG THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE!"
3040,1,"Looks like a bad DC movie, like BvS Eternals make reality what seemed impossible:That a superheroes film, in addition to being boring, can be tremendously pedantic.Also has awkward series of murky flashbacks, that provides a disjointed Eternals origin story while attempting to build to the obligatory Armageddon-like battle at the end.Besides, The depth of character too is slight, and the CGI effects don't really break any ground -- and occasionally look Sharknado cheesy."
3041,10,"Bold, Brilliant, and Beautiful addition to the MCU! We absolutely loved Eternals! The character building was in depth and so much more than expected for such a new, large cast. The script was beautifully written. The cinematography was mind blowing. I loved the complex relationships between the characters. What a beautiful addition to the MCU!!!! I cannot wait to go again and also to see what comes next! Bravo! Chloe, thank you for introducing us to this gorgeous Eternals MCU family!"
3042,7,"At long last, ETERNALLY boring The very first time I've watched a Marvel film and thought, 'These are actors, in costumes, doing pretty silly stuff.', the entire movie. IMAX added very little to this culturally ambitious, but seemingly rushed, and oddly amateurish, production. Jack 'The King' Kirby received proper accreditation for the creation of these characters, however, I did not find Eternals to be a fitting tribute to this seminal Marvel creator."
3043,8,"Critics didn't do justice to this Masterpiece by Zhao Just came out of the theater, I feel the critics haven't done justice to the film, Yes, the first 45 minutes or so of the film are a little slow-paced and could have been done faster, however, the remaining portion of the film definitely redeems it for me, Kumail Nanjiani absolutely stole the show, despite having a single film to develop 10 characters, Chloe Zhao has pulled off a breathtaking film, the film's ending is poetic and works for me on many levels, a solid 7.5/10 from my side for the film, also, a sequel for this is inevitable, given how the film ends. Can't wait for the sequel!"
3044,7,"Eternals is different and unique like how it was quoted, but it had some issues. The 25th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a very different movie than what marvel has been doing for over a decade, and I liked the concept. Its a two and half hour film but doesn't seem to be boring. Yeah it's a slow movie as compared to other MCU films but that's what makes it unique. The slow parts are also very interesting as the conversation between the Eternals makes us understand a lot of stuff which is quite important in the story. The movie was shot and edited beautifully, the Deviants had flawless designs as well as when you see the celestials you know how giant and powerful they are. Cloe Zhao's direction was pretty good.Still having so many positive points, it's not the best Marvel movie. It felt sometimes very predictable, I missed a proper ending, it was like too smooth and when it ended I was like ""Okay, that's it?"" . Also one other problem is that they are completely different from other Marvel stuff. We haven't seen a single character once and we don't relate to them as much as we relate to Thor, Spiderman etc. And then Introducing not one but TEN Eternals at time, it didn't allow me to make them emotionally attached to me as much as it needed to be. But I can't think of a better way to do it. It was just a very little time to introduce that many characters. Also some decisions they made were like WHY? To me and also in my opinion it failed to show us how powerful the eternals are. On the other hand I feel Shang Chi did a pretty good job for it.I like Marvel doing other things than usual and taking risks, I would not call it an overall bad movie, it's pretty good but it has potential to get even better. I loved the fact that its not a superhero movie filled with action scenes but also focused on the drama part, where Marvel lacked in some previous films. As a Marvel fan I have my hope that Marvel will do it better next time but it's a pretty good job overall."
3045,7,"Epic, Dence, Visually spectacular Brilliantly executed by Chloe Zhao. This movie expanded the scope of MCU, there are a lot of subjectivity to unpack.This movie is not just about action, it requires complete involvement throughout the movie.The visual effects were spectacular, for sure one of the top 10 MCU movies."
3046,10,"Beautiful and Amazing! Love the visuals ,emotions, diversity in cast and personality ,Very Entertaining . No frame is without imagery, and the action scenes, especially the opening montage, are stunningly choreographed. That said, when it comes to building up characters that hold interest and subplots that you can actually invest into, the film falters., Loved it."
3047,10,"Am I the only who doesnt understand why everyone is critisizing the movie?? The movie is greattt.. Its honestly amazing. Not just the visuals, but the story was really great and yes it will completely change the history of the entire MCU. So for people who are weeping over against homosexuals just piss off. We live in a world whr representation matters and is necessary and if u dont care about it then alright ill watch the movie as much as possible for disney to consider the movie a hit."
3048,7,"Great Visuals & Action Director Chloé Zhao did an amazing job but did gave more DRAMA & ACTION. The best part of the movie was its GRAND VISUALS it was an awesome experience. All Actors performance was amazing, Harish Patel was also great."
3049,1,"The Same formulaic garbage as before Listen, this movie is fine, and it definitely deserves its 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, that is for certain. However what it doesn't deserve is audience praise, that I know. It's the same exact thing that marvel serves up in half of its films, suffers from the same villain problems, and doesn't develop its large ensemble cast enough to make any of them really sympathetic. It wasn't an awful movie, however after movies like Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy, Endgame, Civil War, Winter Solider, and Infinity War, I'd expect more from marvel than another Thor The Dark World or Age of Ultron. That's why I gave it a 1/10, cause I expect more from Marvel."
3050,7,"A REALLY GOOD MOVIE AND THE REALLY BIASED AND PROBLEMATIC CRITICS This movie is heavily bombarded by biased critics and people who are used to watching marvel movies as kids' movies. Eternals was a grown movie with a very serious tone to it and all I can say is finally. Chloe Zhao really took some Marvel aspects and gave them a clear natural look, going away from the formula of every MCU film. I loved the extensive use of on-location shoots and the very well-done VFX that blended with their natural surroundings. The plot, like in EVERY MOVIE, had its problems but the twists and the grand plan made up for every mistake. A visually stunning film with a great music score that is meant to be seen on the biggest screen."
3051,7,"It is a satisfying movie. I am still waiting for that X-Men movie man.Not too familiar with the Eternals, which is why going into this I was thinking they were like mutants, the same way the Inhumans are like humans. With that said, like the Inhumans, the Eternals cannot beat what Charles Xavier and his misfit crew put together.The Eternals do try too hard to stand-alone. I am looking for a lot of references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I did not get enough for my taste at all. Realistically, this is why I go to the theatre to see these movies.As a standalone, movie it was not half bad. It had a fantasy like story with many cool characters played by good actors. I did like how complex a lot of the characters were. I felt that the Eternals moved away a lot from the superhero genre, nothing in the movie is as cut and dry as most of these Superhero movies are when it comes to the main characters being heroes.Because of this, once again a marvel movie is missing a good villain. They could have used one. As cool, as the characters are they did a lot of talking. Some of the characters like Kingo and Phastos were interesting enough to want to hear their story. I wish this held true for everyone, but it did not. Plus, all the talking made for too many moments where I forgot what the purpose of their mission is.I am impressed with the visuals, especially the Celestials (who keep changing with every movie they appear in, right?). They were impressively big seeing them on the big screen. I do not know if this was Chole Zhao's first rodeo when it comes to special effects but she definitely did not fall intio the same mistakes that the Russo brothers and Ryan Coolger mad on their first marvel movie outing.That is about it, however. It was not enough of a marvel movie to watch it on the big screen like the others with other people as into it as I am (cause no one else seem to be). I'm glad I saw it on the big screen cause the visuals were impressive but we are getting to the point in which I don't know who these marvel superheroes are and its changing my interest (Although in fairness I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy where before seeing the movie and they won me over far better)."
3052,9,"Spectacular Action Screnes I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. The action sequences stood out and was thrilling. The story was also good. The acting was top notch. Don't listen to critics, see the movie and judge for yourself."
3053,8,"Intriguing film but think about it this way... As I have read the reviews posted, I'm a little confused as to some of the lower ratings. To begin, this is NOT your MCU/Avengers movie that you're used to. We know through the first 3 phases that there are cosmic influences and powers beyond our imagination but we've been experiencing these stories mainly on Earth with characters that everyone has known, in reality, for decades growing up. Now Disney/MCU is going where no man, except Captain Marvel, has gone before.There are some pros and cons to this film, which I will say is the most visually stunning MCU picture yet. So I am going to try to use generalities instead of movie specifics so not to spoil.Pros: As I said above, incredibly striking cinematography, this film was built for large home theaters and IMAX to fully engulf your experience. Larger than life! The cast was excellent... anytime you can pull favorites like Hayek and Jolie and they are fine with taking more of a backseat to the rest of the younger cast... I always appreciate that. As a history buff I appreciate the walkthrough of the ETERNALS life here on Earth and how it interwove with history... there's a lot of story to unpack, could've easily made this 3 movies and character built more effectively but I think the MCUniverse is fixing to explode with heroes and villains and Disney just couldn't spend that kind of time on each character within. Also want to give a big shout out to the levity in this film, mild but well timed!Cons: the story is choppy at times so you really have to pay attention to what era you are in. Really would like to have seen expansion toward the beginning and focused on the Deviants a little more but again, time to build characters is never easy and this could've been a 6 hour film. I do NOT appreciate a sex scene in my superhero movies, do NOT! It was mild in comparison to other PG-13 and R movies but be mindful bringing younger kids to the cinema. I understand that love is a central theme but I don't have to physically see it manifest to know that. There is a gay couple with an adopted child in the film so parents do with that information what you will. I wanted more story from the mains but I think some of that will come with time, and seeing it again.All in all, really enjoyed it. The movie doesn't follow the story line from the comics at all but it's like book adaptations, it's just impossible to navigate books effectively to movies and you feel you get the same experience. Don't listen to the negative reviews on here, go make your own opinion of this next phase... it's not Shang-Chi but thank God it's not Brie Larson as Captain Marvel either... horrible casting on that one, Disney!"
3054,10,"A different and risky movie. Because of that - a masterpiece. The movie Eternals takes time. It has nothing to do with the other MCU movies. It's much more poetic. There are those who say it is slow, I don't agree, I think there was a great concern to introduce the context well, to make sure that cliché situations were not created just so that they could use easy solutions. Eternals are neither heroes, nor villains, nor anti-heroes. They are purposeful beings, and they don't all have the same purpose. There is an enormous respect for each character, there are well-defined power levels, but all characters are carefully developed, which creates a complex and unpredictable plot. The film ventures into some more controversial sequences, but does it with such smoothness and mastery that the scene just flows naturally.It's far from the typical superhero movie, there's no fuss going on 100% of the time, there's no excess of lines, no senseless fights. There are, however, pauses, moments of introspection from the audience, which intensify the characters' pain and make us understand the side of both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"". And all the jokes and fight scenes are epic and hit the timing on point.(Next paragraph may contain a really really vage spoiler, no names and no specific details mentioned, but it's just a warning)I just thought that it failed to develop a certain aspect that was crucial to the outcome. Something in the film has a lot more impact on a certain character, so much so that it makes her commit the unpredictable, not having as much impact on the audience, perhaps making them doubt why this character made that decision."
3055,8,Good Movie for any Debut characters!!! It's a good movie..I was able to connect with all the characters throughout the movie.. But one thing that Marvel should reduce the runtime of the movie. 2:30 hrs for a this type of story is not that profitable.
3056,5,"Disappointed, Just average I had high expectations for this movie even though critics rating was low so booked first show today but i was disappointed. It was a dull movie nothing great and not too bad but i think its now worth watching in theatres. There are only 3 movies i regret watching in theater Captain Marvel ,Antman 2, spiderman homecoming and now this. By far phase 4 of marvel movie doesn't have a good start black widow was just average and this but shang chi was good, i think they shouldn't have made this movie too long."
3057,7,New experience If it go to the way that could me cry maybe I will give it 10/10. This movie try to make us feel human stuffs. So I feel like I need more dramatic emotional scene. However it is the new experience in the MCU movie. PS I didn't expect Kit Harrington to be this charming and cute.
3058,3,"Mediocre at best, last Marvel I have seen in a cinema! Yesterday, I went to go and see the latest Marvel flix, Eternals. And again I went home with a sensation that ""This will be the last Marvel I want in the cinemas."" A quarter of the audience did not stay till the end. For me, it was not that bad to walk out. But OMG that movie is tiresome. I really good not to make heads or tails of it. The story was all over the place. The acting was not of the level you expect of those Marvel actors. The music, the visual designs of the and costumes... mediocre at best.But I think perhaps I was very spoiled by the last movie I saw, Dune. Dune is in a league of its own, on all levels. Perhaps if I did not see Dune, Eternals would not have been such a big disappointment."
3059,2,"They have to make something bad to get better stuff As boring as captain marvel and thor 1 This movie is that.It's so slow with lion king music and the characters are so rare, not in good way like the guardians of the galaxy Let's wait for Spider-Man!! And skip this."
3060,8,"Very different from the Marvel formula I loved Eternals. I understand why many people did not like it, since it is very different from the Marvel formula. Great story, cinematography, and character development. The only negative aspect is that the movie expands the MCU universe a lot and now I have many doubts and hunger for more!"
3061,9,"Undisturbed viewing must It's a wow movie which requires only undisturbed focused movie . Less on action and more on story building . Having said this , the action sequences are great with the cleanest of CGI I've ever seen . The overall plot maybe be simple but certain characters offer complex tales. I am glad that movie had lot to offer than the trailer itself. This is a matured superhero movie with a tint of DC style storytelling."
3062,1,"Don't waste your time on this garbage! Don't get fooled by audience reviews, they are just fanboys trying to find a comeback against critics who have given this flick a generous score. This is an unwatchable exposition dump with the usual Marvel humour and CGI, with a supposedly talented director and a star-studded cast, who can't act. Funny thing is, the best actor in this ""flick"" is a comedian!"
3063,1,"I did not like Eternals POSITIVE:Cinematography is dopeSpecial effects are dopeKumail Nanjiani's character is charismaticI love the way they show Ikaris, Sprite, Gilgamesh and Makari use their powers.NEGATIVES:I cannot relate to any of the charactersPlot is a mess and sometimes does not make any senseSersi, Ikarus, Druig and Makari are so one dimensional.It's full of talking in the 2nd act. And I can't even hear them fully talk because the background music was distracting.I feel like Phastos being LGBTQ and Makari being handicapped is just there for the sake of being there. There are just your typical token black people, especially Makari. Like, ""Hey look I'm black and LGBTQ and hey look! I'm back and deaf! I'm in this movie but nothing is done with me, I'm just here because of representation."" There is potential in her to make a good compelling story but Marvel missed the mark.Sersi and Ikarus' storyline is very uninteresting. Like,if you take out their romance storyline it will not affect the main plot in any way.There is this storyline with Thena and Gilgamesh but it is cut off quickly and the payoff was meh. Gilgamesh is like Makari, he has a potential to tell a good story but his character was just wasted.I hate the way they show Sersi, Phastos and druig use their powers. So lame.Deviants are just disposableMarvel stepped up before giving us empathic villains such as Killmonger, Thanos, Vulture, Mysterio and Wen Wu, but unfortunately in Eternals you don't know the villain's perspective of why he is doing the things he is doing, of why he is evil.I don't feel like they re authentically a team. I mean compared to Guardians of the Galaxy, in their first movie,we know and is convinced that the Guardians are now a team,a family. In the Eternals I don't get that.CHARACTER RATING FROM BEST TO WORSE:Kingo - 5 starsGilgamesh - 4.2 starsSprite - 3.9 starsMakari - 3.2 starsThena - 3 starsPhastos - 3 starsAjak - 2.9 starsDruig - 2.5 starsIkaris - 2.2 starsSersi - 2.1 starsWHAT I WISH ETERNALS COULD HAVE BEEN:I wished it could have been more like Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians Of the GalaxyEternals feels more like Josh Trank's Fantastic Four or X-men :Dark PhoenixLast note:""Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it's decoration.""I feel like Eternals is all decoration."
3064,7,"Solid Addition The film is definitely worth the watch. There is a lot to unpack in the film. Not your traditional Marvel film and that is good. Sometimes changing things up is a good thing. Visually, this is a very beautiful film that met expectations."
3065,7,"No Avengers, but a great lead up Spanning all of time, flashing on booming empires of most eras, this epic Marvel blockbuster is no joking matter! Containing at least three full comic books of origin stories for the ten main eternals, this film should be watched like it were an appetiser. The main meal will be tremendous, judging by this pre-emptive smorgasbord of powers!Not Gods, yet named as some. Not universally renowned, yet they had been there done that. Not evil, yet not good, either. These new kind of heroes only fight one kind of enemy and avoid interfering in human conflict, even though their touch can be traced throughout written history (their names a big clue).Their battle is akin to humans' plight with religion. And metaphors aplenty can be gleaned from a view!I, personally, cannot wait until I own it on a disc to re-watch as many times I need to discover the many levels of comprehension doted within! It's not your normal Superhero film, because the Eternals are not your known superhero type! Watch with an open mind and your eyes will open wide in awe!"
3066,7,"Overall a good movie Different than other marvel movies, just a bit lengthy. The connection between the celestials and the eternals is described a lot of times which I think is useless. But the direction, actions and lightings are exceptionally well. There are many twists in the movie.. :)"
3067,1,"Boring, long, empty This is by far the wrost mcu movie I've seen. In fact i walked out furing the movie due to the lack of a good plot. All this movies has is cgi and Angelina Jolie. Everything else is a mess."
3068,8,"A dense meta look at gods living amongst humans that sets itself apart from other Marvel films Eternals is a dense and majestic Marvel film that deconstructs the Marvel Cinematic Universe superheroes as Greek Pantheon-like gods living amongst humans in a sprawling narrative that spans through human history. It's tonally different from any Marvel film we've gotten and takes one further step into reflecting upon what ""super"" and ""hero"" in ""superhero"" means. The closest comparison would be Zack Snyder's Justice League.Nomadland director Chloe Zhao brings a freshness that diverts from the usual Marvel formula, though its arthouse sensibilities may turn others away. The film takes its sweet time introducing ten characters of the Eternals ensemble and cross-sections through each of their respective backstories.The story explores what god-like powers mean towards helping mankind, similar to Star Trek's Prime Directive. What is the right amount of help for mankind? Does helping mankind alter their destiny? Is humankind even worth helping?There is a tinge of Terrence Malick's sensibility where the camera stares blankly into nature's void, looking for life's answers watching waves crash on the beach.It is essential to see Eternals in IMAX. Ben Davis' cinematography is breathtaking but more importantly, it is the sheer scale of the frame that lets the nature shots overwhelm and engulf the audience. The IMAX shows what it is like seeing Earth from God's point of view.This poetic search for grandeur is what I enjoyed most about Chloe Zhao's vision. Eternals takes itself more seriously than other Marvel films and seeks gravitas. There's less of that trademark Marvel ""buh dum tss"" humour, which I deeply appreciated.All the time devoted towards its grand mythic storytelling comes at the cost of developing its core love story. The relationships between the Eternals members are told more than shown and are only skin deep. This unfortunately lessens the dramatic impact that it so needs at the end.I enjoyed Chloe Zhao's ambition and appreciated the breath of fresh air. Eternals is my favourite out of the Marvel Phase 4 thus far, including the recent Disney Plus shows. It's not for everybody and commercially-minded audiences may lose patience with it and it will most likely fly over kids' heads.Usually at the end of every Marvel film, I am long accustomed to feeling, ""That was fun but didn't really hang together. I guess they'll fix it in the sequel."" With Eternals, I wanted something more from it. It was so close to sticking that landing. So close."
3069,3,"Watching was like a bad date; just waiting for end The scenery was very pretty but the color palate was very very drab.Unfortunately, it was very boring and a Marvel movie should never be boring. I never cared about any of the characters even though all the dialogue was written to make you care. Parts of the movie felt like some of the extended melancholy moments of a Lord of the Rings movie, but without the wordless action to move the plot along. It was LONG, by the end it felt like a bad date you just wanted to end."
3070,2,"Another below average movie Watch dune again, instead of watching this peace of sh*t. Nothing new in story and no character development no charecter depth just CGI action sense and visuals Apart from that there is nothing in this movie. And the end I would say Don't Watch total time and money waste."
3071,9,"It's so different,and that's why is amazing and great By far, the best looking MCU movie yet. The landscapes, the use of natural light, even the aesthetic of everything Eternals-related is simply mesmerizing. The fight scenes are actually cohesive, so you can fully comprehend what you are seeing, and it shows clearly how strong the characters are, how they individually fight with their own styles, and how tough their enemies are.Eventhough the movie is very long and it has some slow paced moments, it is introducing at least 7 new characters that are going to be in the MCU for a while, so it is not an easy accomplishment - and it does it very graciously. The team is formed by different people, with different powers, points of view, motivations, and you have enough time to understand what makes them individuals.Ironic that a film about humanoid-deluxe-robot-aliens can show so much humanity and love for mankind. And for that, I have to say that it trully has a much better subtext than any other MCU movie, because it found it's own way to tell this story, and now I'm glad it did."
3072,9,Mcu redefined I love the movie. Before watching the movie I was wondering how a director would tell a story of 7000 thousand years but the director did a good job.the movie being slow paced is the fact that made me love because the story has to cover 7000 years and 10 eternals. The visuals are outstanding. The movie has redefined the future possibilities of the MCU and has awesome post credit scenes.
3073,5,"Another dud from Marvel It's even worse than Shang Chi, and trust me, even I can't believe that's possible.Marvel needs to stop being complacent after making records with Endgame. Can't take fans for granted with boring movies."
3074,10,Marvellous Guys please don't trust anyone's review this movie is best marvel movie of the year and the VFX and story line is awesome and then the action sequences is also best .I hope everyone will enjoy this film Some of the toxic fans are hating it because of this movie is having a superhero based on superman and flash .Horst opinion is 8.5/10.
3075,10,"A Really Different Marvel's Film The pace of the film didn't bother me at all, similar to ""Infinity War"" in that sense, they are long films, but it doesn't feel time passing, the only ""defect"" of the film is, the extremely monochromatic Color Palette and definitely breaks the expectation of having some psychedelic and colorful looks like in Kirby's comics, but due to the Zhao's background and photography style this was already expected, but this manages to bring more drama to the film. Because of these and several other factors such as the film's editing, ""Eternals"" ends up in fact out of line with all the MCU films and takes it to a new era, with more seriousness, drama, unforced representation and less humor, in addition to working very well what it proposes, which is expansion and detailing of the Cosmic side of Marvel universe."
3076,9,"Haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna po tate MCU fans that aren't invested in the comics are the likely haters on all threads, and maybe those trolling about a homosexual kiss. Get over yourselves. Go pick up some Jack Kirby books.The Eternals (both in comic and movie) is a tale of the many differences in life and choices we make.This movie is about life, family, and a sense of purpose- with the very real struggles of everyday man represented via deus ex machina.I went to see this with my father, and he's a very smart man; Well educated, but he's of a generation that goes to the movies to be entertained and not to be provoking any thought. His favorite marvel movie is Iron Man.Was that a good movie? Yes. Do we need 1000 Iron Man cookie cutter movies? Heck No!We have been spoiled by the MCU providing the best in super hero cinema and visual effects.This movie is no different than that except... the pacing is a little slower to flesh out a larger cast of characters (of whom we've never seen before) and so that we really feel for these ETERNALS.If anything, I'd say the pace of this movie is about the same as Saving Private Ryan.Everyone played their part very well.Chloe Zhao could not have done better. This was truly a magnificent look at humanity. (I can't wait for the longer cut to come out. I'm sure this could've been a 4 hour movie and I would've loved it just the same!)For all the haters: Maybe you just need to process a bit and then see it again, or read a comic, or just think of this movie outside of your perspective on what the MCU is or isn't."
3077,10,"It was fantastic in many places, but there were some flaws I think if you want to enjoy this film you need to know history and comics about eternals and I have that, the film was for the most part very clear . There are some mistakes like not telling the story chronologically, but I could deal with it."
3078,10,SPOILERS FREE REVIEW Totally different mcu movie and the deviants are very scary to watch . A bit slow in the middle when explaining about their past but it was superb in overall with all sides being covered in the movie . And the mcu will totally change after this movie.
3079,10,Grand Movie Eternals is very huge and beautiful movie. Despit the reviews the movies is very very good. Great Action scenes and the celestials is just wow. Don't listen to negative reviews. A must watch movie.
3080,4,"A nonsensical comical (not in a good way) travesty MCU has created such a great universe and produced a plethora of outstanding and immersive movies, but Eternals is a joke for a superhero movie and doesn't deserve to be called an MCU movie or in fact a superhero movie.Director tried to infuse heaps of different themes and concepts into this movie but they just made it worse and at times it just feels like watching few different movie clips of disparate genres. They included elements related to a various cultures and nations to lure people into the cinemas, and it didn't work at all for the movie. The story is so incoherent that it just keep on switching from one direction to another.Especially scenes of Kumail Nanjiani are so laughable, I felt like I am watching a B grade inane comedy movie rather than a superhero movie. Sometimes these scenes were so cringeworthy and stupid, I just wanted to leave the theatre in the middle.Overall, I would rate this movie between 4-5 only because I like the spectacular sceneries and CGI in the film, the way Ikaris shoots pure laser beam from his eyes, and of course because of Angelina Jolie."
3081,10,"One of the BEST MCU movie ever! It's garenteed the most stunning yet meaningful movie that Marvel has ever made. It's a piece of art, so that it might not be suitable for everyone. But Chloé Zhao was able to bring this story into another level.Even these Eternals are god like creatures and so powerful, but mentally, they just like us.Finally, bringing up the question, ""Are humanity worth saving?"" Chloé's answer is ""Yes""."
3082,9,"If you listen to the critics, you'll miss out on an incredible movie I cannot for the life of me understand the poor reviews from the critics. I was lucky enough to see Eternals on the 3rd of November, and it very quickly became one of my all-time favourite Marvel movies. For years, people have been crying out for Marvel to move away from the typical superhero 'formula' and Zhao definitely delivers. Eternals is a superhero movie that feels bigger than just a film. It has a depth that is missing in previous Marvel films and every aspect of the film is beautiful. The visuals are stunning, the cast is incredible and the chemistry between the main group of ten is obvious. The storyline is engaging and includes twists and turns that the audience won't see coming. Sure, it isn't as fast-moving as other superhero movies, but there are ten Eternals that need to be introduced enough for the audience to care about them and so that takes some time. However, it never feels boring and it never drags. The entire cast is incredible, but Barry Keoghan as Druig, Lia McHugh as Sprite and Lauren Ridloff as Mikkari deliver standout performances. Eternals is a breath of fresh air as it's different to your regular superhero movie, but still adds so much to the MCU and is so enjoyable. It is definitely not a movie to miss."
3083,10,"Doesn't deserve the negative reviews & firmly in the middle, among all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Eternals is based on the Jack Kirby comic book of the same name. It tells the story of the Eternals who are extremely powerful & immortal entities. The Eternals have lived on Earth for thousands of years & have been present for many of its historic moments.Eternals is a mind-blowing film. Director Chloe Zhao has brought her flair for breathtaking visuals, to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cinematography by Ben Davis is absolutely gorgeous. What's super impressive is that all the locations in the movie are real & not green/blue screen, which is usually Marvel's modus operandi. The action set pieces are excellent. The visual effects are superb. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The camerawork in some scenes are a bit too dark for my liking. The Deviants are quite unremarkable as villains. Also, there are some minor inconsistencies in the storyline, and there is not too much humor compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, this film doesn't deserve to be the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first rotten-rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes. Zhao has also done a phenomenal job, giving each main role to such a diverse cast. Gemma Chan is spectacular as Sersi. Richard Madden is amazing as Ikaris. Chan & Madden share electrifying chemistry together. Angelina Jolie is outstanding as Thena. Kumail Nanjiani is the star of the show as Kingo. Lia McHugh is awesome as Sprite. Brian Tyree Henry is brilliant as Phastos. Lauren Ridloff is awe-inspiring as Makkari. Barry Keoghan is great as Druig. Don Lee is unforgettable as Gilgamesh. Salma Hayek is impressive as Ajak. Harish Patel & Kit Harington are memorable as Karun & Dane Whitman, respectively. The supporting cast is good. Eternals is a must watch for all Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. I promise you won't be disappointed but, expect a one of a kind Marvel film. Can't wait for Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021)!"
3084,8,"First half... The first half could have been shortened. The emotional story was a bit spilled. I could doze off a bit. The second half was better, more actions and twists. Overall good plot but some minor plot holes did make me feel not entirely convinced."
3085,7,"The best looking movie of 2021 Eternals really is stunning from the first scene all the way up to the end credits. The story, as we have unfortunately have come to expect from recent MCU entries, is sacrificed in order to fit as many heroic team-up shots and action scenes in as possible. However, the fantastic concept still makes for an enjoyable, although rough around the edges, plot. The acting really manages to elevate the story though, the entire cast is amazing."
3086,10,"Absolutely incredible is how I'd describe it Honestly I'm a hardcore mcu fan but this exceeded my expectations. It had something unique to it and guess what it was, the dark gritty tone the jokes were there alright but a short amount of them. The visuals were absolutely incredible. The lore is just amazing. It had good plot twists as well. Plus the action scenes were top notch. Overall I'd say it's a must watch however there are certain things that might upset a few viewers like a little bit of lgbtq+ scene and a few adult scenes."
3087,3,Boring. Packed cinema but there seemed to be a lot of people who just looked bored.If I wasn't with a group then I most likely would have got up and left.It all seemed very slow and boring. I don't really have anything good to say. Didn't enjoy it at all.
3088,8,"I loved! I left the cinema with my eyes shining! Starting with the most notable: Photography. It's beautiful! It's like every frame of the movie is a painting! Every design of the characters, creatures, environments and the entire movie is beautiful!The feeling is that we are seeing an epic and unforgettable film, supported by the excellent soundtrack. In addition to editing, making the film flow very well, even making some temporal frills, as they lived many of our stories from the past.Chloé Zhao's direction is off the curve, but it becomes subjective, because there will be a lot of people who won't like it because it's not like other Marvel movies, but it has all the little points that Marvel has: lightness, great action, great special effects and good comedy.Ah! I would like to leave my satisfaction with the script. For those who know the Eternals comics, they will see some differences and this can affect their experiences. But I loved it! I really enjoyed the unfolding of the story, I really liked the outlines of each character, their personalities and attitudes.Briefly, I loved it! I left the cinema super thoughtful and excited to see them again! Really enjoyed! It's in my Top5 for sure! By the way, the movie has two scenes after credits! Extremely curious for the future of Marvel movies!"
3089,4,"More like eternally long, amirite? By casting an actress that has already played a major part in one of the films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has run into a problem it frankly should've run into sooner, given the sheer size of it (just look at how quickly it happened with the poor saps at DC, casting Djimon Hounsou in two separate roles in films released not four months apart). We now have Gemma Chan, who played a Kree in Captain Marvel, in the role of a peaceful Eternal.The most important question on your mind right now is probably: Wait, what's an Eternal? And how have I missed that there's a new Marvel Studios movie out?Indeed, Eternals seems to have the Marvel geeks mildly enthused at best (I'll include myself here if ""pretty decent knowledge"" counts as being a Marvel geek, even if I've had mixed reactions towards the MCU). This may be because this feels like a more generic MCU prequel, focusing squarely on a particular character or group. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the MCU, we have the aftermath of Thanos' ""snap"" and boy is sh-t getting freaky!We've had Wanda Maximoff creating a pocket dimension wherein other universes appeared to ""bleed through"", which, even though it was a fake-out, led to exploring different timelines within the MCU we all know and then seemingly getting into PREVIOUS big-screen Marvel universes, judging from what we know of the next Spider-Man movie -- which, yes, is set to star both the Maguire and Garfield versions of the web-slinger (don't get me started on the Morbius trailer). Eternals? Yawn.Okay, on to some actual new review content: From what I've understood of Marvel Comics lore, the Eternals are the people of Thanos (who's also a ""Titan"" but I guess that's more to do with migration) and since that villain needs to be upstaged, the only possibility is Galactus, but we don't even get a tease for him here. Another thing that would make sense, now that we're getting real cosmic, is a follow-up on Guardians of the Galaxy's tease for Adam Warlock but no cigar. The Eternals themselves don't have much marquee value and the trailers have done little to make anyone but the hardcore Marvel simps especially hopeful.What this means, as I'm sure you've noticed, is that the Usual Journalists have had to bend over even further backwards than normal to make this film seem remotely exciting. I've seen reviews that grasp at all the straws they can find to paint this bland, bloated video game-looking garbage as great filmmaking (even when the reviews praise nothing in particular), and writers of the same ilk have had to REALLY doll out the ""firsts"" -- first gay superhero, first deaf superhero, first *insert race* superhero, first MCU sex scene (the first Iron Man begs to differ), and so on. Did you think all those sexist Black Widow haters were bad? Well, just you wait. You're all kinds of -phobe if you don't like this one!We learn that these Eternals have watched over humankind for thousands of years, including years where they definitely could've lent a hand in defeating the likes of Hitler, Mussolini, or indeed Thanos. We do learn that they were instructed by the all-powerful Celestials to only interfere if ""Deviants"" are involved. We learn all kinds of things, but don't really wind up liking anyone, nor do we get to see anything that sets these powerful, humanoid aliens apart from most of the other powerful, humanoid aliens we've seen in the MCU -- apart from when they generate swirly gold that looks kind of cool. One of them even borrows a trick from Loki.The cast is rich, to be sure, featuring Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani (whose ""Bollywood"" scenes constitute a highlight), Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, and Harry Styles as Thanos' brother Starfox (and yes, the Mad Titan's sibling looked like a boyband twink in the comics too). These actors do fine, but their assignment is to play generic comic-book characters in a generic MCU film that I'm forgetting more and more as I'm writing this -- aside from a few truly cringeworthy jokes and bizarre references to DC Comics.At least we're getting Blade soon, apparently."
3090,7,"It was good. Could've been better It was enjoyable. Really liked the concept. Vfx are great. Fight scenes are good. Cast is good. The costume designs are good. Has some flaws. Acting could have been better. Most of the jokes didn't work. Some scenes felt disjointed. The villain deviant was bad, his arc was poorly handled. Pacing was a bit slow. Still a good movie. One time watchable. 7/10."
3091,7,"Decent A bit Vague movie , but that doesn't means it's bad one . This movie is bit different from usual Marvel movies as expected . Story was good and clear , Storytelling was also good but they failed in clear characterisation for the characters . Main reason for unclear characterisation may be the number of characters , there are 10 Eternals in the movie , so there may be lack of time for the character establishment . Sometimes I felt , flash back scenes were affecting the flow of movie , but they were important for explaining the origin of Eternals . This time Marvel humor bit failed in some places . Movie also had some plotholes . Marvel is famous for surprising elements , this movie didn't had that as expected . Cast done their job well . Asusual visuals were stunning and Marvelous , cinematography and Vfx were topnotch . Music was good . We should really appreciate the Marvel for LGBTQ ( Gay ) reference in the movie . I really liked the making style of Chloe Zhao . Overall a decent Marvel film to watch . Eventhough movie has some flaws , according to my opinion it's worthy one to watch it on Big screen ."
3092,8,"Eternally good Eternals gives a new diverse and unique angle to the mcu. The story is a deeper one than most mcu films and as an 1st (in what will presumably be a trilogy) it sets the stage nicely with strong themes of family, some excellent children fight scenes and a different type of action movie. With some surprising groundwork for future eternals projects and massive potential for some long awaited fan favourite crossovers. Critics will dislike this film because marvel has used one type of theme/angle previously, but this breaks the norms and didn't dissappoint."
3093,7,"Different but interesting... ""Eternals"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch the start of a new saga of Marvel. The Eternals are a group of immortal beings living on Earth, helping people throughout its whole history and through all civilizations.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie since I have watched all the previous Marvel movies. A new era starts with this movie and we all have to be patient about it because time is needed for it to grow. Plenty of information came up and answered some of our questions regarding the Eternals and their purpose. ""Eternals"" surprised me since it was very different from what I expected but it was also interesting so, I am expecting the way that will continue it and what else it's going to present to us. The direction which was made by Chloé Zhao was good and she presented very well the main story behind Eternals but of course there is more information that needs to be presented. The interpretations of Gemma Chan who played as Sersi, Barry Keoghan who played as Druig, Lauren Ridloff who played as Makkari and Richard Madden who played as Icarus were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Eternals"" is a nice movie as a start of a new era but we expect more from it in the future."
3094,7,"A great and worthy watch! For people who are worried about the film. I watched it and it was AMAZING!! I am NOT a crazy marvel consumer who loves everything marvel releases. I didn't particularly likef Black Widow and Thor, and LOATHED Thor the dark world. Half the bad raitings are homophobic and Quirky people. Who think they are too good to like something popular. The Twists, Oh My God! The acting And the SCORE were *chef's kiss*. Watch it i assure you won't be disappointed."
3095,9,"Game changing MCU film You will hear people say ""Oh Marvel will start to fatigue the more they use the same formula for their films"" While this could have been true Marvel once again reinvented the mold. Changed how their movies look and feel. Eternals is that game changing film. Not only does Chloe Zhao have a signature look for all her films, the movie felt authentic and real. Visual affects were some of the best I've seen in the MCU, the locations were beautiful, the all star cast performed as we would expect from the likes of Angelina Jolie, Bryan Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek and more. The story was on a large scale dealing with humanity, hints to the effects of climate change and making tough global decisions. The film goes between present day and back to the early years when the Eternals arrived to earth 7000 years ago. There is a lot of the same MCU humor and charm in this film which is always the cherry on top when it comes to these films, making light of a situation when lives are at stake. Over all this film was fantastic and most definitely my new favorite MCU film."
3096,8,"Does not deserve the low Rotten Tomato Score! Pretty blown away by the bold choices that Chloé Zhao makes here! It does have its flaws but not necessarily fundamental flaws, more like convolutedness of the story at times. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I went in this movie with low expectations and got out pretty amazed. I loved this movie! Go watch it and stay for the two post-credit scenes at the end!!"
3097,6,Average film doesn't hold your attention The movie has been presented well and so was the graphics...great.. however story line never connected..unlike avengers the introduction of each superhero is immediate...so u never connect.... A lot of Asian and Indian connect but no one connects.. Aldo felt 3D was not best in business..felt the work being a tad...uncomfortable..
3098,3,"One of the worst Marvel movies yet Most of the marvel movies are just okay. Entertaining to watch once as an action flick. This is just bad. The movie has choppy pacing with meaningless action and uncompelling and severely underdeveloped characters. If you like Twilight, you might like this too."
3099,7,"DC movie Bad story , bad act , bad cast and everything is creepy and bad.Don't see it .. it's waste of time.I feel like watching DC movie with mix of marvel and Nolan movies !!!!!!"
3100,7,"Really really disappointed 😞 I know nothing about these characters so I was hoping this would be a good intro to them. It wasn't. I really struggled here. I found the story pretty boring and the characters flat. It looks like this movie was made for existing fans, which is fine, but not for me."
3101,8,"The bad reviews are a lampant case of bad faith The movie is profound, spectacular, brave. The cosmic side of Marvel breath into it. Not for all tastes, for sure. Great acting, stunning visuals, wise script. The director is capable of twisting from the intimistic view to the epic view, without effort. Same ability in twisting from comedy to drama. Great message of humanism, of cohexistence. The real Marvel spirit."
3102,8,"A nice change of pace for MCU. First of all - The visuals of this movie is breathtaking. Trippy, epic, magnificent grand, add any adjective it'll fall short. It is unlike any Marvel movie in terms of the scope and grandeur. On an IMAX screen it's truly an amazing experience.This movie misses the mark a lot of things-the pacing and length being the most obvious.But the parts it hits right outweigh the misses. The casting is top notch. At no point it felt like SJW cash-grab, each character had a distinct role. The performance is what holds a lot of the scenes and the jokes from falling flat (yep it goes there), and the chemistry between the cast feels organic - during the dramatic scenes and fight sequences. Marvel always gets the casting right for sure.The background score by Ramin Djawandi is amazing.This movie touches on a lot of topics and some things go really well. The timeline hopping narrative. Historical fiction blending with the Celestial mythos. The fight sequences have good CGI. It's not a PS2 game. The CGI is actually really good.The film feels like it starts a lot of things and takes it nowhere but the path it does tread are done well. Zhao's touch is the most prominent in this journey of these characters.And now as a comics fan watching Jack Kirby's name and to see his work on such grand display is enough to get me satisfied. The work he did is still relevant and creating new trajectories in the MCU, it is a delight to see. This movie may not be the best MCU entry, but there is also no other movie like this in the franchise. It has a a heart. It has it's faults and that's why it's a good movie. In a way this movie is like Druig's description of Humans. Worth watching for sure."
3103,10,"Fulfilled My Expectations To be honest. I enjoyed the whole movie. It was uniquely and weirdly beautiful. After few minutes I got bit bored but then suddenly I realised that this was needed. Chloe Zhao built up the story in a very beautiful way. The BGM, VFX & CGI, choreography, camera work are awesome. It felt so refreshing to me. The emotional aspects were on point. And comedy ? Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel(our beloved Indian actor/comedian of 90's movies) definitely nailed it. They always caught our attention. Top to bottom the movie was so perfect. I think the Deviants were needed to be explored more. And yes the credit scenes ? Specially the mid credit scene ! The people gone wild ! There was a mysterious character at the end of the end credit scene. You'll be able to recognise him. It's one of my favourite MCU movies right now.My rating : 9/10."
3104,10,"Amazing Journey Eternals was just an incredible movie from the beginning to the end. I didn't even notice the time pass.All the characters are well developed, with different motivations and perspective of life, Each of them has their own drama and personality.The movie is way more mature than any other MCU movie, really a fresh air to this Universe."
3105,6,"Beautiful to watch but the story falls short. Wonderful, in fact spectacular in places the visuals are arguably the best of any recent Marvel franchise film. And there are parts of the move which work well, the Bollywood scene and parts of the Amazon village scene (light comedy done well).But the majority of the dialogue is sleep inducing, interspersed with what seem to be slightly altered Dr Strange look alike fight sequences. It isn't a three hour move but watching it felt that way."
3106,6,"Didn't feel like MCU Anyone else feel like they were watching the bts on a Creed album cover shoot?Kumail nanjiani was amazing, stole the show. Beyond that, Kit Haringtons arch has potential for the future. Everyone keeps mentioning the visuals but honestly when it ended and I saw Weta did the vfx I was surprised how weak they were not bad but just basic. Please start hiring experienced Directors again. This formula of taking popular indie directors and throwing them at a Blockbuster right away isn't working."
3107,9,"The movie is good It doesn't deserve the hate it is getring. For a change this is something different from marvel. I dont know if the critics wanted the generic one to one superhero movies or what, this movie is well written with nice twists. And the setup for the future is also nice."
3108,7,"Different but not upto the mark Eternals is more like an emotional movie, not like any other marvel movies this is different. It is visually Great, Good VFX & Cinematography.But dont expect too much. It doesn't hook you with the plot which is disappointing and bcz of the screenplay it makes us to think whether it is a marvel movie or not.There is some good comedies which is like all the marvel movies.Lots of DC stuff 😂 I've seen in a marvel movie. Post credit scenes were gud although Waiting for Eternals Returns.7/10 ⭐⭐⭐"
3109,5,"Very loose script I was really excited for this movie and went to see this with good expectations but nothing went as expected.Script was loose and screenplay was very shattered. There were problems with editing also. Direction also felt weak, didn't seem like it was directed by Oscar winner director.Story was weak and childish and it looked like if too much was added in the movie. This could have been easily two part movie.Overall, this movie was an unexpected disappointment. Hope, they improve in sequels."
3110,10,"Best Marvel movie Excellent movie which absolutely doesn't deserve all the bad reviews of the press. The sets are sumptuous, the characters are very well exploited. One of the best Marvel movies."
3111,9,Really good If you're doubtful whether to see this based on critic reviews...don't be. This film didn't let me down and I'm sure it won't for u guys too. The visuals are spectacular and the story is really good. The storytelling is amazing and damn Makkari is one of the best speedsters in movie history and a close second to Quicksilver from the X-Men. She's just raw power and really good. Ikaris arc was soo good and makes us feel what wants us to feel.
3112,7,Great work Chloe Zhao brilliance. Action scenes were just a little bit lacking but the way the film is directed is just awesome.vfx was excellent. End credit scene was🔥
3113,2,"Pile of stolen ideas, uncooked meal Seems like DC has infiltrated Marvel to create the worst movie ever.I thought Suicide Squad was awful, but it is a masterpiece, comparing to the Eternals.The movie lacks structure, story, characters, for G-d sake. Jolie and Hayek can't save this disaster!"
3114,10,Splendid Visuals All around amazing film. The story is fantastic and the portrayal of the characters are awesome. The final showdown was amazing. Director Chloe Zhao has made a masterpiece.
3115,4,"Another Flop for phase 4 MCU MCU Phase 4 really has been a total bust for marvel and the streak of flops continue. First Black Widow, then Shang Chi and now Eternals. Some people say Eternals is like a DC film, far from it actually, fact is Eternals still acts like a typical MCU movie, the problem is its the same formula we have seen since phase 2 when the company was bought out by disney and people are just getting tired of it now."
3116,1,"Blend, boring, predictable Bring back great scriptwriting and storytelling instead of these McDonalds movies. Pointless to starstruck your movie and fill it with glittering special effects if it's just an empty shell.Wish todays movies focused more on casting and building up a great story, instead of packaging.I guess it's a good reflection of our current society. We want instant gratification without contemplating much about it and then we move on. But what do I know :)"
3117,10,"One of the best MCU movie till date Chloe Zhao is brilliant. Never saw such fantastic cinematography before in MCU. Story was good enough, finishing could have been little better. Beginning of a new era......"
3118,1,"DISSAPOINTING Not engaging at all. The pace of movie was boring and slow, the visuals are good but director was clearly crippled with bad characters and bad script. Some characters like Ikaris, Druig, sprite and especially Kingo are so repulsive that you cant even stand them. Also the climax of the movie is so confused i mean are you fighting deviants , fellow eternals or stopping emergence I mean make it clear. Kingo is such a bad character build up as a badass runs from the final fight never to bee seen and that Ikaris guy just out of no where flies into the sun. I mean are you kidding me. Bad writing and very bad casting. Full sympathies to chloe zao I think marvel wanted her to fail so that they can remove her to appease the chinese communist party so they gave her the worst script but still can't deny the amazing visuals."
3119,9,"Amazing movie :) from a non-marvel fan. The movie is actually very good. Good story and good cast. It is something different what people expected so no superman, no iron man and no wonder woman and other bullshits.ON the big screen it looked stunning NOT CGI and green box feelings at all.THe whole movie looked so real and natural.. The jokes were ok also.By the part of Areshim and the baby gods ... i was schocked.I give 9 point because it was so brave and unique with lot of knowledge and work and of course Angelina Jolie. (AAA filming star)"
3120,3,"All visuals no content That's all visuals no content.No plot, no jokes, irrelevant acting. But you for sure can create a lot of cool posters from this movies screen grabs.What a waste of a great cast."
3121,3,Boring The most boring movie ever! Thor the dark world is a better movie! Yes i said it thor the dark world is wayy better. The main character is boring the scenario is boring this was like someone from dc tried to make a marvel movie and failed miserably.
3122,10,"Fake Reviews, Real Experience! Don't get catfish-ed by negative reviews. It's as Marvel as it could get and yet the most different one from all. Extremely important, superb visuals & brilliant performances.LOVED IT!"
3123,10,"Incredible Visually beautiful film, simple story that you watch and admire, wonderful characters, impeccable direction, one of the best of the year. The fight scenes are breathtaking, every second of the movie is a marvel. The most different movie from marvel and one of the best."
3124,10,"A new visionary MCU movie! Thanos was right about it.Telling a story from another point of view, which is different from previous contexts, is so difficult Apparently, the director accepted the challenge and did a great job with great visionary style."
3125,5,"Yikes... I've enjoyed the marvel cinematic stuff. I'm no super fan or anything but they've been fun. This wasn't an enjoyable entry for me unfortunately. I really liked Zhao's Nomadland last year and Nanjiani has consistently been a highlight in his other work, so I went in with some expectations, but not many.What worked: 1. Some great cinematography, lighting choices and environments were gorgeous.2. Costumes when the cast are in their human clothes, they all have distinct and interesting style choices.3. Some moments of enjoyable performances. Harrington and McHugh were standouts.What didn't: 1. Many performances fell flat, but I feel like the CG might be partially to blame. Multiple times Chan delivered a very flat 'run!', but it was delivered just as the CG baddie was already chomping down?2. Some CG was poorly tracked which was very distracting.3. Script and narrative structure dragged. By the third soap-opera-esque monologue about love the guy next to me in the theatre was huffing. Relied on lots of weird tropes like 'the baddies were trapped in the last ice age and now they're thawing out'. Giving me flashbacks to Transformers. I refuse to believe locating things in ice would have been an obstacle for super-advanced beings.4. The 'super hero' costumes were very rubbery looking. When the actors were crouching or raising an arm there were big flubby sections of their costumes sliding around and buckling. Considering how good the similar costumes looked in an entry like Captain Marvel, this was confusing and distracting."
3126,10,ETERNALS IS ESSENTIAL I whole heartily appreciated this movie for what it was. -' introduction the cosmic universe.. in part.. people forget that the staple of MCU is their ability ti make the irrelevant relevant & they did EXACTLY THAT... again.Beautifully casted & executed it acts as the gateway to what is to come.. MCU gets a WHOLE LOT BIGGER.
3127,8,"Wierd , Slow and Great For me this movie was so different . The story , the characters everything was so different and I was able to connect with each characters . The scale was large . The celestials looked absolutely awesome . The fight scenes was just Wow . The story and the reasoning was all good . I deducted 2 stars for the pacing . It became wierdly slow sometimes and again sometimes fast . The scenery was beautiful but the cuts between past and present was pretty good and clever but it didn't fit after what happened to ajak . Plus it didn't make sense to not show atleast one avenger . Come on its an Avengers level threat . What is Dr strange doing lol ."
3128,7,"More Thena please! My thoughts exactly. #Eternals probably need more time for character development, more thoughts into storyline sequences. And more Thena, please - her skills & powers were cool AF, reminded me of Unlimited Blade Works from Fate/Stay Night! (3.5/5 Scales)."
3129,8,"Riveting story, fine engaging performances Chloe Zhao skillfully and cleverly crafts a story with enough twists and turns to draw you in and earn its two and half hour runtime. Fundamentally, the story and acting propel ""Eternals."" Both are nuanced and often exquisite. ""Eternals"" is beautiful to watch in that respect, like watching a moody, brooding Shakespearean production unfolding. I was really quite pleasantly surprised in that regard. I am intrigued with how Marvel proceeds from here on!"
3130,4,If Marvel Made a Lifetime Movie I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for months. The trailer looked pretty sweet and something I would love! I had hoped it would be like Dr. Strange with its quirkiness and cute humor and a spiritual edge.Well that's not anything close to what I got. I will say visually it is pretty nice but honestly nothing I haven't seen before. It's like mash up of all the past marvel movies. It felt like they just took the leftover ideas and visuals and costumes of everything from Dr. Strange to Black Panther to X-Men and tried to serve it as a 5 course meal in 2 hours and 37 mins.Half of the actors did a great job with what they were given but they couldn't make up for the other lifetime movie performances and super bad script. It all felt rushed and disjointed and the humor was trying way too hard to be like Dr. Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy but completely missed the mark because it's been done before and much better.I did appreciate the diversity and some of the symbolism but it was like being forced to take overly sugared cough syrup. The added gay family is also applauded. But yeah this feels like a shiny glossy regurgitation of great movies we have already seen and a waste of such great talent.Oh and Kit Harrington (of all people) saying I love you Sersi was too much. Come on! Some other reviewer said this feels like a bad SNL skit and I have to agree. Bleh.
3131,9,"Marvel owns my soul lol. Having been into marvel comics and trading cards and cartoons since the mid 80s, I consider myself a true marvel geek. And as the headline states, they own my soul lol. I'm obsessed with all things marvel, and the MCU is the greatest thing ever created (lol...I'm serious).Moving on to the movie at hand. This film had me gasping in awe with my jaw on the floor at the visuals (Arishem, WOW!!!). One jump scare even had my buddy laughing at me and my reaction! The acting was fantastic. I really loved the humour from Nanjiani's Kingo, although at times it seemed mildly misplaced. The diversity of this cast is truly way overdue for the MCU, and as a gay man it is very much appreciated!I never knew much about the Eternals growing up, but I'm so glad Marvel Studios brought them to the big screen!Very well done, very exciting spectacle of a film and truly different than anything marvel has done before. IMAX was perfect for this and I can't wait to see it again."
3132,9,"One the most underrated mcu movies ever This was an extremely interesting movie with probably the most complex script the mcu has had. The conflicts, structure, the moral dilemmas, character relations and just the way it all plays out hand in hand is on such a complex level that I, when watching it, couldn't quite believe that 1. I was watching a marvel movie and 2. The reception to it has honestly been as bad as it has.As someone who studies scriptwriting I can't help but feel sad about the fact that once Marvel dares to be complex, to try new things and break out of their formula, they recieve massive criticism for it. On top of being one of the most advanced stories to come out of Marvel so far, it is one of the most inclusive. I loved the representation in the heroes, they all looked and talked different, and nothing was forced. It was just a natural reality, which reflects the real world much more accurately than say the Avengers where the big majority are American white guys. Apart from being inclusive in that sense, they had the first deaf super hero (played by an actual deaf person), and the first openly gay marvel hero. These are such important things to include and represent on the big screen, to send the message that there is no ""right"" way to be, but rather that everyone is okay the way they are, and everyone can be superheroes. The best thing about this is that none of the character traits were the main focus or even the most interesting part of the characters, but rather just natural elements of them, like any other. It's just an amazing job and a wonderful initiative on Marvel's front.It deeply saddens me that this movie has gotten as bad reviews as it has, and I honestly can not begin to fathom why. It's a great movie, with some of the most interesting conflicts, story and structure I've ever seen in the mcu."
3133,10,"Great Movie (the negative reviews are just trolls) Very funny, visually stunning, and epic. The super powers were extremely entertaining and the narrative conflict was a deep existential crisis that was pulled off effectively. Overall, a refreshing perspective on the Marvel universe and I'm excited to see what happens next."
3134,8,Astonishing One of the most beautiful and astonishing Marvel films. The pace is a bit slow but I don't mind that much. Some interessting characters with great actors. I'm curious how Eternals will fit in the future of the MCU.
3135,9,"Proud of the Eternals team-spectacular work A beautifully shot film with emotional complexity from a wide and fascinating cast of characters. The introduction of so many new characters was handled with aplomb-and the stakes for them and the inhabitants of Earth felt real the entire time.There is a key point in the finale when the audience was split in my theater-half of us cheered, and half were just waiting for the other shoe to drop, knowing that the outcome could not be a simple one. I will mark that as a spoiler out of caution. But it really does encapsulate the film's message: if you are sure you are doing the right thing, you may be sorely mistaken. Nobody is who they will become."
3136,9,"Marvel's Justice League Eternals is a beautiful movie with heart and in 2 hours and 30 minutes does a better job of expanding on lore and setting up bigger things than unfortunately ZSJL did in a 4 hours (Still great, a 8/10 for me). This movie is the perfect length, it has jawdropping action, great comedy, and even twists that no one could have expected from the trailers. Chloe Zhao in my opinion is worthy to continue this series and has truly shined once again with such a heavy task on her Director plate. The Eternals themselves are layered and have their own desires and needs themselves and you will appreciate them all in their own way and feel you've taken a journey with them, the audience I was with seemed to enjoy every bit of it. The dialogue around this movie has been vile, especially by certain YouTube channels I will not mention but rest assured, the diversity here is not in your face and no is here for ""representation"" sake. I cannot wait to see it again soon, it really blew me away and I left with the smile that I tend to always have walking out of a Marvel movie.. isn't that what it's about?"
3137,10,Amazing Loved the visuals. Loved the South Asian representation. Watch of the two post credit scenes. Sets up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.One of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe films of all time!
3138,10,"Great film I thought the film was amazing. I was captivated the entire time. Loved the cast and diversity. The only thing I would have liked changed if all the eternals could have had the same accent, I get in present day they were living in other places but even in the past they had the same accents lol."
3139,2,"worse than THOR 😑 Bad directing, Bad screenplay, Badly written, its worse than THOR nickthefreak Bad directing, Bad screenplay, Badly written, its worse than THOR. The reason is said to be the film's LGBTQ representation but this is a false narrative pushed from MARVEL team for saving face. Eternals is jammed to the rafters with great ideas, but too many end up weighing the film down instead of letting it fly. The story is bloated and underdeveloped, featuring too many characters and a clumsy plot. Chloé Zhao] is somehow out of her element here as she struggles to juggle multiple character arcs throughout the ponderous 157-minute length."
3140,1,"You can't be serious The film is absolutely awful. The only way you wouldn't exit the theater early is because of spectacular visuals. The decent star cast did their bit well, but the storyline is just as good as watching a candle burn, bland and pointless. I was excited about its Diwali release, but the crackers here didn't burst at all. But yea, the visuals are good but the directing, storyline was below par."
3141,5,"Weakest Marvel film I've watch unfortunately The visuals are great. Some transition cuts between scenes were just awkward. I think this is the weakest script writing (and directing) for a Marvel movie that I've watched, which is sad when you have such a stacked cast. Some lines were just jarring and weird, and pockets where I thought to myself, ""uh... okay"". I think it need not dragged on for two hours plus, or it needs to have better ""build up"" scenes. The build up was too long that by the time the story got to the climax, I was just done with it and can foresee what was going to happen."
3142,7,"7.3 Eternals wasn't like anything I have ever seen from Marvel. It is a visual masterpiece featuring great action and character power. It felt very fresh and new. Filled with shocking character changes and secrets. I have always wondered how the actors can act with cgi fake weapons when they aren't actually holding anything. You have to go see it! Opens the door to many more movies, cant wait for the sequel.Now for the marvel ranking. It is safe to say this falls in the top tier of marvel productions. I would rank it after winter soldier and ragnorak but before infinity war and endgame....yea that good. Go see it."
3143,9,"Eternals is a beautiful movie for marvel fans and non-marvel fans. Eternals is one of those movies you can walk into the theater and you don't have to know everything about marvel to understand. Throughout the movie I was in absolute ""aw"" over the stunning visuals and the story telling. The cast really brought this movie together, you would think with this many ""main characters"" they couldn't tell a story for all of them, but that's were your wrong. During the movie you learn to love these characters, feel their emotions and feel what they are going through. Only thing that I criticize the movie about is pacing could have been a bit better but that's really it. Walking out of the theater, I knew that this movie was now one of my top favorite marvel movies! Hats off to the people that worked on this movie y'all did amazing."
3144,4,"Not Marvel's worst, but definitely their most disappointing. For the amount of talent working in this movie, Eternals shouldn't be this dreadfully mediocre. Its concept is genuinely intriguing, and there's so much for the movie to explore...and it just doesn't. It misses the mark almost constantly. The characters are undeveloped, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden's chemistry is very poor and they give unusually flat performances (given that they are wonderful actors). Angelina Jolie's character, Thena, is one of the better characters, which is absolutely due in part to Jolie's commanding screen presence. But even she feels underwritten. There are some emotional beats in the film that I feel just aren't impactful. The movie works best when the team is together and working off their chemistry with each other, but there is unfortunately not a whole lot of that and a whole lot more exposition. The script, by the way, is awful. It is completely devoid of nuance. The dialogue is the most cliche, uninteresting dialogue you could possibly imagine. It's kind of tragic, because the whole cast is really giving it their all with the performances, but the screenplay is genuinely such a mess that it undermines the actors' performances. This movie should have been better. There are worse superhero movies, but this is among the ones I don't have much interest in watching again. Venom is a terrible film, but at least I can have fun with it. I can't really say the same for Eternals. It's too poorly-paced and too long. What a letdown."
3145,2,2 only cause IMDB forced me First Zhoa shouldn't have done this film cause she tried to copy Denis Villeneuve instead of doing her own vision. She was influenced by Denis' Dune but that's not how you make a Kirby film. It was boring. Maybe cause I'm a New God's fans and the Eternal's is Kirbt's spiritual sequel I'm not a fan. It just dragged. Every character felt meh minus Sersi and Black Knight. But what pisses me off most is the post credit scene. Pip the Troll voiced by Patton Oswalt is an an abomination not cause of Patton cause his is my ideal casting of Pip and reminds me of how the MCU screwed up the Infinity Gauntlet (hardcore Starlin nerd) the MCU was due as failed.
3146,10,"It's better than dune(visually), it's better than dune (story and plot Wise) and it's better than the Snyder's cut (no matter how hard his cult is trying) and overall betterDC These is the best superhero movie out right now get used to it reviews don't affect the movie quality,no matter how hard you try on YouTube, twitch to pull it down doesn't change the fact that you don't even constitute 0% of the movie going population , most of you have never seen a movie in theater and that is why your favorite franchise fails.i wouldn't be giving spoilers because sites like these are how you watch it."
3147,8,"Awesome in one Word I don't know why those critics rate the movie so bad,It has a great story, with lots of great action & great visual effects.... Must watch.. Don't miss those two credit scenes..."
3148,5,"i'm so sad I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There's a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes were interesting but poorly executed.Sigh. I'll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie.Edit: I watched it again, in IMAX of course. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. All of my initial flaws are still there. But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn't drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She's generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan. I really like most of the other characters and wish I could have seen more from them. Kumail Nanjiani is awesome, except when they give him random ""insert joke here"" lines. I'm curious to see more from most of the characters.This movie is still very flawed. And I absolutely hated how certain character conflicts were resolved after major decisions were made. But if you can move past the bad, you can enjoy the action, visuals, and ambition. Rating updated from 4 stars to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening night 11/4/2021, 11/17/2021)"
3149,9,"Great Movie Until Climax The Eternals Impression: (9/10) - ignoring the climaxOkay this is a really strong movie **at first**. The characters are great for Marvel characters, nothing seems forced (albeit admittedly a bit rushed when introducing them). The action and effects are absolutely top-tier and the humour isn't forced and legitimately hilarious in it's execution (IMO).The lore building and character building for Icaris and Sersi are pretty well done too (at first), and I think the reasons for not intervening in human history and getting into spoiler territory, SPOILER Ajak's reading for wanting to save them SPOILER.Skipping over the meat and potatoes, the movie is legitimately great (IMO) until the climax. The climax is awful in writing and completely shits on a so far well written character. The climax is legit like a 2-3 for me, not unwatchable, but definitely will ruin the movie for a good chunk of people, and then followed up by the aftermath which is even worse/more stupid, it's horribly written.The ending is at least good/great and both the mid-credit and post-credit scenes are pretty interesting, introduces two significant (at least I think so, given who one of them is) additions to the MCU. SPOILER 1D fans will nut SPOILER."
3150,10,"FOR ME THIS IS........ ONE OF THE BEST MARVEL MOVIES FOR SURE!What I learned is that I will never judge a movie by it's low score, form your own opinion. Maybe you'll end up like me, LIKING THIS MASTERPIECE VERY VERY MUCH!"
3151,10,It's a good movie. The movie is a bit underrated by people but it's actually good. There are some scenes that makes the movie bad but just forget the scenes and watch the action that this movie has.
3152,6,Look forward to future iterations with a more Metropolitan experience A good story and a good set up for future films. Not great mind you. There were no emotions linked to the viewing and probably 30 minutes too long. Nothing noteworthy in terms of the acting but it was a fun ride. Movie shows us the origin story of the Eternals and follows them as monsters start attacking on Earth. Can the Eternals figure out what's going on?6.6 -6.9 out of 10.
3153,10,Great movie! I loved this movie! This movie did a good job of giving focus to each of the characters and showing the chemistry between them. While the action scenes seemed to be a little different to what the MCU has done before it also fit right in. While the movie did have some slow points the whole flow of the movie worked well while still giving new information to the viewer. I will definitely be watching this movie again!
3154,10,"A faithful and resounding adaptation of Jack Kirby's strangest work. Personally, I loved this movie and these characters. A true and faithful adaptation of one of Jack Kirby's more peculiar brainchildren, the Eternals. By no means was the film perfect, but I believe what Chloe Zhao managed to accomplish was nothing short of remarkable. With all of the themes that were presented and explored (morality, free will and self determination, the burden of immortality, etc), and with the sheer number of characters she introduced us to, it was truly an incredible feat. By far Marvel's most ambitious movie to date, crossover events notwithstanding, and certainly it's most beautiful, both visually and poetically. The invigorating score, the captivating cinematography, the gorgeous visuals, the heart-pounding action, the use of real-world natural settings wherever possible, and of course, the brilliant performances by the cast- all the very best the MCU has offered.Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, the story isn't perfect. There is more than one flaw, but ultimately, it can be boiled down to too much story, too little time. Why this was not a Disney+ show, I don't understand. Had all of the strengths of this movie been retained and the story was simply expanded upon without diminishing those qualities, this would've far surpassed any other Disney+ show to date. I only wish Marvel's top brass (yup I'm looking at you, Mr. Feige) had had the foresight to acknowledge that the task of introducing an audience to 10 new characters in a film, and expecting us to care for them, was simply a task too tall to handle, even in the hands of a capable Oscar winner. For what it was, and what it was given, this film was the best that it could be. I didn't find the plot to be convoluted as some have criticized, nor do I believe it was overly expository. In fact, it was in those moments of exposition that I found myself begging Marvel to dig deeper, to finally break through those seemingly immovable boundaries of the superhero genre and explore more mature, dramatic themes. Alas, I don't believe the time restraints of any feature length film would've afforded that opportunity.If Eternals did anything, it definitely showed us that Marvel is ready and willing to explore new themes; to break the mold; to rid themselves of that overbearingly repetitive formula. If Shang-Chi dipped its toe into new, fresh, and feel-different MCU waters, Eternals plunged its leg in. I hope this trend continues and eventually, they dive head first into the deep end. I honestly can't wait to meet these compellingly interesting characters again sometime soon. To say I'm excited about how this movie has expanded the Marvel universe to cosmic proportions would be a dramatic understatement. Outside of Infinity War, I haven't been more excited for an MCU sequel. I highly recommend watching this film, especially if you're a Marvel fan, but even more so if you're a Jack Kirby fan."
3155,7,"Good MCU movie with its typical flaws, but not the bad movie these other reviews want you to think This movie is very similar to other MCU movies where first 2/3rd's are great but 3rd act falls short. The movie does a really good job separating itself from other MCU projects which I personally look for. The acting is great, and the lore that this movie introduces is really good, and sets up a lot of cool possibilities for the future of the MCU. All that being said, it's a good movie that could've been special but fell short, but I do believe it's closer to an Age of Ultron than a bottom tier MCU movie people want to make it out to be."
3156,1,"it's just bad Marvel is losing themselves after every mcu movies. I start to feel like it;s not marvel anymore, not the story that i used to love, instead of making a good story, they try to make everyone like their movie, which make it lack of connection, a lot of things is illogical....... I just can't stand this. Maybe i should stop hoping for a good mcu movie."
3157,10,"Great movie sometimes a bit much Nowdays if people dont like the tinyest thing in the movie they will give it a 1star.I came to this movie after reading all the reviews here expecting to be disapointed.BOY I WAS WRONG.All actors there give great preformance and even in the 2 hours watch time (that felt like 20m) i couldnt get enough of some of them that i really loved.Without going into spoilers ill saythe tragedys hit me hard.the judge celestial is acting just like the judge celestial in the comics and with a great prespective great cgi and great voice work he does look very manacing also like a celestial should.I could talk on the good stuff for houres but the movie does have flawsso what was the downside of this ?Well, 1. For me biggest is they intreduce a LOT of new things to the marvel universe.I mean... i dont think they follow the main avengers or relating to the avengers at all in this movie its all completely new stuff also when u have a world with 5 or 8 even superheroes its great they are important but once u add to this world eternals / celestials / divients / avengers / superman ?! I mean wtfb/ maybe in the future xmen its a bit too much... too much storylines to follow that dont combine so much with one another.Also i dont understand in loki tv show there is a new villan in the end of it in wondavision she becomes sort of different in the end.In here you got all the thing with the celestials i mean...we didnt even got to spiderman and already we have so much new villans and storys i really hope doctor strange wil fix it in 1 year.Another issue i had with this movie is yes...where where the celstials when thenos wiped half the world.(if they intreduce superman even as a side joke here...then you could ask where was superman also....it never ends) but ok they address it in this movie a lot of times.But Where was the avengers when the s$&@t in this movie went down ?Its like they dont want to see each other or something ..in general i really really liked this movie it has its flaws some bigger once some dont make sense but literelt every movie has flaws even 10/10 ones.I loved it a lot and do think it deserve to be watched in cinemas.Im not going to remember it in 1month but i had an amazing time in the cinemas and cant wait until i see the rest if their storyline.You should def. Watch it."
3158,1,"What did I jus see? Movie doesnt make any sense..no correlation, no flow, tried to insert unnecessary scenes out of context. Not sure how do i unsee this? Marvel rushed to bring in characters in process of opening Marvel Universe in Florida...they want to monetize movie into a flywheel (like disney but failed miserably)"
3159,10,Great movie Just a great film. I have read and watched many of the reviews from critics and I don't understand what their problems with the film was. It is my favorite MCU film ever.Go see it!
3160,6,Philosophy 101 No spoilers. The first 2/3rds is very slow. The last 1/3rd is much more fun. But this is a movie about philosophical questions and not a superhero smashing bad guys. Not for everyone.
3161,1,"Eternally boring Long, convoluted, derivative story that goes nowhere. Mostly talented cast wasted as they look confused while staring into space.As a big MCU fan and Kirby's Eternals fan, I'm deeply disappointed. Worst MCU movie by far!"
3162,8,"Hey movie critics, are you okay? I can't be the only one who's noticed that this movie bombed with the critics. My question is, how? I genuinely hope it's not only because a woman directed and wrote it. I also hope it's not just because it has a beautifully diverse cast spanning from POC to people with disabilities. As a huge MCU fan who can sometimes get caught up in the obsession myself, I knew to come into watching this movie without too many expectations on the plot aspect. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is as good as any other MCU film and even better than some. I implore you to watch the movie with an open mind, not just as a superhero movie but as something more. As something new. If you see the film through the eyes of someone seeking modern-day thematic elements, then this is the movie for you. If you want to know why the Eternals didn't help fight Thanos... welp, that's in the trailer. This movie made me laugh, made me cry and made me think about its meaning. Isn't that precisely what a movie is supposed to do? All be it, the first post-credit scene made me cringe. I think that was its purpose-a minor WOW factor. The second post-credit scene, however, made it all worth it. I can't wait to see what the Eternals have in store for us in the new phase."
3163,1,"Good as visual, but bad as a movie Is very good as a visual but very bad as a movie. I think marvel did a mistake in here, especially bring something we know its so sensitive, and the movie is so bad, this is the worst movie from marvel."
3164,9,A different flavor for the MCU I really enjoyed this different pace MCU film. So many questions left at the end. It will be interesting to see where the MCU goes from here and how everything is tied together. The film had me on the edge of my seat. Amazing visuals and a great cast.
3165,1,"solid 1 out of 10 Worst marvel movie we've ever seen. The scenery and costumes are visually stunning, and that's about the only positive thing out of this entire movie. The dialogue and music both drowned on and on and on, like a loss lonely whale dying in the ocean. The humor was almost non-existent and let's not even talk about the ridiculous plot lines."
3166,9,"Too cramped but It's reasonable The visuals are fantastic, especially the scene in the Indian ocean and last scene. There are many bad reviews about this movie but we need to understand that this is the first film about the eternals and they are establishing it. This opens new opportunities for other marvel films, also the friggin celestial were just introduced and I'm excited to see what Marvel studio will do next. I am hopeful for sequel but to address the complaints of other marvel can just raised their standards again."
3167,10,Eternals is a remarkable 2021 marvel movie The storytelling is incredible . The actors and actresses were so well done . Angelina and Selma were the right ladies for marvel . The eternals couldn't fight thanos during endgame and with iron man and captain America gone one of the eternals must join forces with the avengers and fight a larger villain in the mcu . And hopefully where ever the eternals go a bigger plot will come .
3168,10,"Unique, amazing visuals, does NOT deserve the hate! Firstly, I can't believe the amount of Marvel ""fans"" who gave bad reviews to this before it even came out JUST because of its diversity. It's nearly 2022, get your heads out of your straight, white minds' and deal with the fact that Marvel is becoming what it should be: diverse.Now, onto my review! I loved this movie! Chloé Zhao did an incredible job with the world-building around this new plot for setting up the new phase of the MCU. Not only that, the cast worked so well together to bring these characters to life. The on-screen connection between Gemma Chan's Sersei and Richard Madden's Ikaris made me go through so many emotions. And I was so happy to see that Phastos's marriage with his husband wasn't pushed to the side, we actually got to see them be cute and care for their son together.Overall, I loved the plot, the visuals, and the cast. I can't wait for this to be continued!"
3169,10,"A thought provoking game changer. This is a sci-fi Greek tragedy. Beautifully shot and acted. We finally get the visuals needed for speedsters and Superman level powerhouses. So many minorities represented, definitely a film the world can see themselves in. Love the gay hero and his family. So many standouts and exciting nods of things to come. Marvel fans should be giddy. Real Marvel fans who recognize the diverse world the books inhabit is finally reflected onscreen. Stay for the credit scenes!!!"
3170,2,"Beautiful but boring This was the first Marvel film in awhile where I regret rushing out on opening night to see it. I could have waited weeks and not felt like I had missed any sort of spoilers or hype. To me, it was overall a dud. Cinematically, it was pretty but the characters are hard to connect with and in place of the usual marvel fun; it felt like it was trying to be a masterpiece...except they forgot to make it enjoyable."
3171,8,"Top 10 MCU movie Very enjoyable film, funny and interesting. Great story full of twists.Amazing visuals. Perhaps a bit too long but it wasn't the easiest story to tell."
3172,10,"In the beginning........... In the beginning... Eternals is Marvel's biggest swing in years. Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently. Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it. The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely unique, and full of heart. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. Eternals is also Marvel's most diverse film by far, a bar that, while being so low as to be easily stepped over, is still an achievement to note, belated as it is in the studio's decade-plus-long run. Chloé Zhao did such an amazing job directing, making the phase 4 of marvel for there fans to love and future generations to see. ""We have loved these people since the day we arrived. When you love something, you protect it."""
3173,6,"Eternal Back Story I know nothing of the Eternals beyond this movie.6/10It was interesting as it is something new to me from Marvel. However, parts were confusing to follow for this reason. But not so difficult that I was still able to follow the plot.A Iong movie with alot of characters to explore. Some more than others.Good fight scenes with nothing that Marvel has not done before apart from a few different powers.I hope that the next instalment is more action orientated. The Eternals don't really need more explanation. A really compelling protagonist or other character is needed to spice things up lore-wise."
3174,8,"A great new direction for Marvel Gorgeous cinematography, excellent acting, interesting story, too long. Hopefully all Marvel going forward takes the glossy filter off of the cameras and continues in this style."
3175,8,"Good. Doing things differently. For a start in the new Marvel Universe, I think it was a pretty good movie, and it opens the mind to endless possibilities, both from the previous multiverse and the present.One of the things that caught my attention was the ethnic, cultural, and mental diversity presented in the film, with many nuances.One point against, we will miss that cameo, if you know what I mean."
3176,8,"Better than avengers end game... The story was actually watchable with good pace of action, comedy and storytelling to keep you engaged. CGI fight scenes were decent and especially better when they're using their abilities. The run scene with the deaf eternal was the highlight. Movie didn't feel like it was 2.5 hrs. Some awkward scenes here and there. A diverse cast doesn't have to be bad, this movie for example. Director is good. Definitely watch it in IMAX or Dolby, otherwise it's just a 7/10."
3177,7,"I don't understand the negativity surrounding this movie First, I'll say that Eternals is by no means a perfect movie, however, in my opinion it is definitely an above average film. Definitely far from the worst of the MCU.It's a bit long, but honestly, I enjoyed all of it. All the character interaction, lore, and action worked great for me. The story is told in a very non-linear way which was a big chance to take, but works well.At the end of the day, Eternals left me interested and ready for what more Marvel has coming. I kept this review far more brief and palatable than this movie deserves. I mainly want to say that this flick is not the one you'd think it is based on some early negative reviews. Go see it yourself and make up your mind!"
3178,3,"MCU not a good platform for Disney's agenda! So disappointed to find that the MCU has become a platform for the LGBTQ agenda as well. Features one of the Eternals as part of a gay couple with a son, as well as a pretty long passionate kiss between the two men. Doesn't prove anything except poor judgment on the part of Disney."
3179,2,"The First MCU Movie I Walked Out On I was so bored during this movie that I walked out of the theater. 10 characters was too many to introduce in a movie and the movie spends too much time explaining things. Could have been good probably as a series, but I suggest avoiding it in it's current form as a movie."
3180,1,Worst Movie of The Year and The MCU This movie wanted to be all things at once and it didn't do anything well. Actors are great as expected but I didn't care about non of them. It made no sense and the actions of some of them doesn´t make any sense.
3181,9,"Marvel doing something a little different and I loved it The cinematography, the world building, my attachment to the ethical/philosophical dilemma, to this different vibe even though the film still follows the MCU style, I loved it. It's a comic book movie. And I don't want the MCU movies to be always the same thing. The way it was told makes sense. Anyone who didn't like the storyline path may never read a comic."
3182,7,"Not bad Eternals is almost cartoonish, but in a good way. It's a comic book movie that's ""sweaty comic book fan certified. What I mean is it's a comic book movie that actually explores this fictional world based on the comics. They do in fact take a risk as they take a deeper dive into the history and mythology of Marvel, even as unrealistic and as fictional as it is might seem to be putting that into live action. In my opinion this approach wasn't bad: 7.5/10Also needs subtitles."
3183,1,"Highly Disappointing It's the Michael Bay of MCU movies.Lacked character development, awful sound, the story was disjointed, and so many things were not explained. If you typically love MCU movies you'll probably hate this one."
3184,8,"Meanders but the pay off is huge It's after Endgame so 2023 perhaps at the same time as Far From Home or after so for us really still 2020. That said, I don't understand the choices for music at the onset and the exit, at all. THAT said, the pay off in the last part of the film is huge. Any MCU person in it since 2008 has to see it because ""MCU"". I would suggest reading the comics first and becoming not only familiar with The Eternals but with the Titans (Thanos, etc.). Remember the dude in GotG Vol1 that is shown on a planet during The Collector's description of the Infinity Stoes? Yeah, that's important too so go read up on those! And please for the love of got don't leave the theater until the film is OVER-OVER?!?! People drive me batty leaving. It meanders but then it's great. So it's great."
3185,7,"New yet the same. The movie has the usual Marvel stuff but yet it feels fresh. Its different from others yet feels the same. Though the explanation of why they weren't involved more and helped more is lacking. You get more emotionally invested in the characters than you've been in the past MCU. There's more intimacy than a standard MCU movie which is a lot😂 but it's nice to see that the movie doesn't hide it. Much more representation, a LGBTQ character introduced ( I think it's the first in any major superhero universe, correct me if I'm wrong), we also got a character who is specially-abled.I will definitely recommend it to someone who is tired of the usual MCU troupes and want something fresh, and anyone who loves the old formula don't worry you will have more than enough of that too.MCU is turning a new leaf, let's support them and see where it leads us.Thanks for reading."
3186,9,"Perfect Phase 4 Opening I went in expecting an alright film and came out ranking this among my top 5 Marvel films quite highly. There's a lot of strengths this movie has:The script is legitimately excellent for a few reasons. It takes its time introducing the characters-I could have done with even more in this respect, especially with a couple of them. I was always engaged and genuinely curious.The writer understands multi-level stakes, which most super heroes simply do not nail at all. The consequences feel artificial and the action perfunctory. Not so here. Why? Because along with that the conflicts are all multilayered as well. There is not ""one side"" that's good and the participating characters all have far more nuanced beliefs and drives when it enters the climax.The story is simply written well at a craft level. It only gets more interesting and the implications of the result are super interesting and perfectly usher in Phase 4.The direction is great. Shot composition is excellent. Cinematography is phenomenal at some points. Amazing CGI. Very cool conceptually-far more interesting than most super hero movies (which I've seen all of them).I thought a couple scenes could breath more, and like I said, a few of the introductions feel slightly rushed. Then, one or two jokes don't land. Which is normal for me. Surprisingly, some did. Weird ones. So I'd call that even.Overall, this is exactly what Marvel movies needed. This is an intelligent script. It succeeds as a superhero film but also as a science fiction film, too. It's exciting and made me care about where this kinds of films are going, because they're becoming a bit workmanlike and overproduced. What a breath of fresh air."
3187,1,"Affirmative action movie This movie was unbelievably stupid. The mythology was even more ridiculous than Scientology. Technically the visuals were impressive but the aesthetics were terrible. Lastly, that sappy song about the end of the world seemed more like a place holder for a better song but someone forgot to swap them out."
3188,8,"Excellent start of the next phase I'm all for equality and all those noble ideas, I just don't like them force fed in my entertainment. However the wokeness in this movie never feels forced and it's even logical once you've seen the movie. So please do not skip on this flick because of that.What we get is a visually stunning movie with great locations and amazing CGI (like most of the Marvel films). The actors all have proven themselves in various other projects but the dialogue could have been better sometimes. The actors are limited by the writing and it shows.I didn't find it confusing, it's all explained nicely but you have to connect the dots yourself. Personally I prefer this over being treated like a toddler. Yes you have to process a lot sometimes in a long movie but it's better than half a movie and a two year wait. I actually want to watch it again because of this.What really got me excited was the original plot, it's not all black or white. The ""good"" guys have a dark side and the ""bad"" guys have a motivation you can understand.This is still a popcorn movie but maybe one of the most grown up Marvel movies this far. We still get the usual humor and action but this is an origin movie that introduces us to the new group in our beloved universe, so don't expect an epic ending but a quality set up for the next phase."
3189,4,"Wait, this is a MARVEL movie?!? Listen this is horrible, why are there 2 villains? And in the end it makes no sence that the big bad. Sorry the 2 big bads were defeated so easily, I really hope they kill these characters in the next movie they are in. I found the betrayal of uhhh... what was his name? Whatever, I found the betrayal of laser eye shooty guy really good, BUT THEN HE JUST FLYS INTO THE SUN. Why? He's been behind it all and he just decides to fly into the sun?!??!? Bad movie, NOT marvel quality."
3190,9,"Fantastic cinematic experience From the diverse cast to the incredible cgi, Eternals is one of the most incredible movies I have seen in a long time. Watch it for yourself don't listen to critic reviews. The plot was amazing and the characters had great development."
3191,7,"People are ignoring the point This movie was very different from what we're used to, which make sense as to the reviews. Obviously no ones used to change.There was some aspects of this movie that definitely weren't amazing. I'm not 100% convinced on any of the characters (whether that's due to acting, who they chose to play each character, or how they wrote the story), I think there's potential. Kit Harrington (although we didn't see much of him) did a great job and I have a feeling he may be another actor Marvel nailed on the head with casting. I think they did Lia McHugh (sprite) dirty in the writing of the character, but there's room for improvement.The first half had me a bit disappointed, but as the story continued I actually really enjoyed the movie. It's no easy task introducing this many new characters and new elements in one movie. It is opening so many different movies to the point that it may be overwhelming. But the movie definitely achieved something...Im so excited for what comes next."
3192,7,"Not Bad Honestly it wasn't that bad. Was it long? Yes, but it's Marvel so what do you expect. I liked the characters. There were definitely parts in the middle where I found myself bored and my thoughts were trailing off. Overall though it's entertaining. I like all the actors too! I would recommend giving this a watch...maybe at home though annnnd not in theaters."
3193,10,"Amazing! It was an Amazing movie, plenty of shocking scenes to keep the audience on the edge of the seats. Angelina did an amazing job with her scenes, as did everyone else. Go see it, ignore the critics!"
3194,10,"Worth the watch I'll admit, a lot was crammed into one movie making it long (I would be ok with 2 movies), but it was worth it. It was a marvel movie with substance, good acting, amazing visuals and a lot of potential. I felt like the actor ""diversity"" wasn't forced or focused on. Everyone was just a character with a specific purpose and not trying to flaunt being the first marvel movie with so much diversity. I wish all the marvel movies were like this."
3195,7,"This Film Will Eternally Be Known As The Marvel Diverging Point LIKES:The Comedy: For once, the comedy is not the strongest element in a Marvel movie, not forcing too many jokes or elements to offset the direction this film took. However, it does not mean the movie does not have its comedic moments and I enjoyed a few good quips and running jokes that Zhao and her team wrote into the story. Kumail Nanjiani's blunt styles work well in this film at times and when bounced off of other characters sells the joke to much better levels. Brian Tyree Henry's sarcasm is right on point, utilizing emotion and comedic timing to great levels in order to get a good drive out and perhaps a little personality to his character. The winner of comedy though is Harish Patel whose role is simple, but works phenomenally in an Indian Buddy Hackett sort of way that was natural, fun, and relieved the darker moments of the movie. Again, it's not the wettest comedy, but it works.The New Direction at Times: Eternals is delivering on the promise of being an alternative approach to the superhero film and trying to expand into artistic realms. Using a character focused role, Eternals removes the kid friendly filter to degrees to make a grittier Marvel film (aside from Deadpool and X-men) that starts to bare the mature teeth a little more. The movie is darker, addressing philosophical concepts about life, and converting it into a deeper story past the usual bad vs. Good guys. It works on levels and tries to keep you on your toes for the future of our heroes and this makes for a more intriguing concept than the usual predictable runs. The mature tone means caution in younger audience members, but it succeeds in adding new approaches to diversify the future of the series.The Action, Sometimes: I won't say the action is the most exciting, but Eternals sort of takes the approach of the Netflix shows, where the realism sets in and the danger is real. This approach leads to more suspense at what the character's limits are, while also offering some more strategic warfare required to execute the Deviants. If you are a fan of seeing this style and dropping the 'theatrics"", then you'll be happy to see the magic toned in a different direction, trying to evolve the battles and the circumstances with it.The Story, to a part: We know Zhao likes character building pieces and Eternals shows this in the presentation as a character piece over anything else. Mass integration of these personalities came to light and just how many elements each of these character had. Relationships are semi-dynamic amidst the team, and in this one movie explored a bit into many of them at what their approach to their mission was. It's some of these elements that again open the ""originality"" of this film in the universe and allows you to get some time exploring a potential favorite character past the usual splendor.The Cinematography: While the special effects may be a little limited at times, the actual cinematography is well-done and deserving of applause from this reviewer. Elements from Dune leaked into this movie, with the scale of size differences really standing out. Emotional moments have great angles, the lighting and shading work super well to promote that darker atmosphere. Setting and sequences hold dynamic moments, and all the preparation sort of sells the feelings of the moment as they journey across the Earth searching for the keys to success. I think this may be the strongest element of storytelling to be honest, and seeing all these elements come together really helped set the scenes apart. A nice job on using the elements of NomadLand to this part of the Marvel Universe as it was very impressive for me.The Character Usage: You know me and my obsession with using the characters to significant amounts for their inclusion in the big moments. Eternals had a lot of pressure for at least 10 characters to portray and for much of the film, they achieved that goal. Each of our gods contributes in meaningful ways for me, playing their part and progressing the story to qualify for being mentioned. Some of them are big on character centric moments and moral challenging questions. Others are the action elements who exist to give awesome fights as the tools to fight the Deviants. Several are comedic relief and the humanizing element of the film, trying to bring the superhero element back down to help with the struggles our cast faces. And others are indeed the combining glue of the movie and, with it, tie everything together in a rather cohesive package.DISLIKES:The Story Incompleteness: Eternals new direction has promise, but it can't quite get all it wanted done in the 2.5 hours it had. Zhao is big on diving into her characters' stories and though she manages to touch on the elements and deliver enough of the punch needed to get the point across. However, several of these stories don't feel fully fleshed out, elements that are lacking build up and complete layouts at times feels rushed and blunt at times. This continues to occur over the course of the movie, with an ending that really has crammed elements and is deprived of the extra factor I like in my climactic endings. Certainly there are some theatrics, but a lot of things sort of crash together to wrap things up towards the finale.The Deviants: A major element of this movie is the mystery of the aliens that serve the rivals to the Eternals in this cosmic game of chess. While the design is not bad, the utilization of these creatures and the mystery behind them is kind of blown over and misused on many levels. Really cool concepts get some great starts, but then drop flat, and near the end of the movie are nearly forgotten until BAM you are hit with the elements in a rapid manner. It's not that it wasn't cool at times, in fact it has the coolest move of the movie, but it's shoehorned in and lost to the giant scheme of the movie.The Action Scenes: While there are some awesome fights to show off the power of teamwork, they also feel a bit shorthanded in the grand scheme of the movie. Many of the early fights are very quick, lasting only about three minutes before petering them out, while others are even shorter and limit the teamwork dynamic I like. Other times, the realism sort of gets in the way of the choreography I love, and I feel the punches were pulled to keep that darker element going to stick the artistic vision Zhao went for. Again, I don't hate the action sequences and find some moments I love, but the level of quality feels inconsistent like much of the movie. Even Thena's climactic fight holds some underwhelming moments, and given how much rode on it, that's not the best finale for me.The Pacing: The biggest part about the movie that I feel was kind of the weakest element was the pacing in this movie. Eternals is not the slowest movie, but it's inconsistent for me as I watched things unfold. Flashbacks to past and then present are at times fun to see as they try to strategically give you information about how the Eternals got where they were going. However, other times, it just robs the movie of the momentum and could have been used in a different manner to really maximize everything in the film. It bled into the action moments for me, it led to uneven moments mentioned earlier, and I sort of feel resulted in the limited use of the Deviants as described. Zhao's artistic style was indeed a bold move, but I think she needed more time to really execute everything to the perfect level.The VERDICT: Eternals was a bold direction and opens up for a much broader galaxy and artistic approach to offset the monotony of the Marvel series. Zhao's character centered story approach works for this movie, with all ten characters getting adequate screen time and involvement, as they attempt to take hold in your hearts and memory. It's got layers to the characters, with fantastic exploration of life's philosophy, and mapping out these heroes in manners that feel like a Greek Tragedy. Visual wise, the movie is astonishing in scale and spectrum, helping to really convey emotions and maximize all the disdain of the scenes. And the fact that there is a balance of comedy to not offset this mature direction gets points in my book for following the rules and not getting lost in the popular formula. However, the movie's new approach is not going to be for everyone, especially given how inconsistent it was for me at times and how much it bled into other components. The story has a lot of rushed and crammed elements, not enough to not complete the story, but sort of robbing the film of that full finish she can do. It's ties to the MCU are very limited, and the new path it sets offers the chance for new openings, but is a bit disappointing for those who look for all the connections they can instead of a new pathway to get lost in. For me though, the pacing is the weakest part of the film and it's cascade on the other parts of the movie are the undermining factors. Realistic action sometimes gets bogged down by shoehorned ideas, certain plot elements are lost and then quickly summed up, and the full on exploration of the characters still require more time and perhaps another movie to tell the full story she wanted. Still, not a bad entry into the universe and I will gran this film:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0."
3196,8,"I don't understand the hate Eternals is a good film. Visually it was gorgeous and stunning. Great sound mixing and music. Some color pallettes were questionable but you could barely notice them here and there.. Story wise there were a lot of expositions and less action, I didn't really mind it because of the historical stamps they go through. Sersi's power was by far my favorite. One of the scenes reminded me of when Doc Strange was fighting Thanos on Titan.Director Chloe Zhao work was great. The cinematography was great as well. Once again visually it was delightful. Don't expect hardcore action when you're watching it!"
3197,10,Best sci-fi to come out of the MCU This is the most I've enjoyed visual storytelling since Arrival. The 'Eternals' are some of the most human characters to come out of a superhero movie. Love that they took a chance with this one!
3198,6,"Not the best MCU movie. While I give this movie top marks for its diverse inclusiveness and action sequences I find this movie's pace is too slow and the movie too long.While I appreciate the appearance of LGBTQ+ people in this movie I also felt that the brief same sex kiss between the two male characters was gratuitous and could have been depicted in a different way.Overall, I've seen worse superhero movies than this but in MCU's case I have to agree with some of the reviews that this is my least favourite movie in the MCU. I could have been better."
3199,10,"Recommend No spoilers. Although it is about gods, the theme is human nature, and the most prominent is love. Zhao Ting tried to talk about all the cross-sections of human nature. In addition, there were too many characters. Everyone had to stand up (giving everyone a shining point), and various myths and legends should be involved to push the plot forward (the plot is in the comics). There are enough reversals in the Wei Universe), and pave the way for the future of the Marvel Universe. The amount of information is huge, and Zhao Ting also took pictures of it very beautifully. So it feels to me that the pace is very fast. It seems that I only watched it for 1 and a half hours in 2 and a half hours. And there are laughs and tears. Unfortunately, the space for the director to play is limited. Marvel may not be the best, but it is likely that Zhao Ting is the worst. Thinking of it, a sentence can be used at the end of the plot ""when given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind"""
3200,2,"Eternally Long and Boring While ""Eternals"" was a visually stunning film, it lacked any real storyline and character development. The plot kept jumping all over the timeline of human history and it made the movie hard to follow. Additionally, there were way too many characters with too complicated names.Some of the fight scenes were a lot of fun, but there was way too much dialogue for one film. Great movies knows how ""show"" just as much as tell.I think if this movie would have been off-Earth it could have been a lot better. The celestials were cool entities to bring in, but to have them on Earth just felt like a disservice.I can't think if anything good to say about the movie other than the effects. I would not see this twice. 2 out of 10."
3201,10,"A beautiful and epic MCU movie. It's just amazing and breathtaking it didn't feel like an MCU film at all.It struggles in the first act but got back on track in the 2nd and 3rd act. Ikaris and Richard Madden's performance is amazing.My fav characters are probably Ikaris , Thena and Makkari. Phastos and his husband felt natural not woke ""you're just homophobic"".Every Eternals got their moment to shine and all of them are likable.The Forest Sequence is definitely on my top 5 comic book fight scenes. I really loved it a lot and it's well done!!The visuals are top tier probably like the best looking marvel film. The deviants are op but felt generic in the third act and the main villain is just WELL DONE! The motivation, why they did what they did. The love/family are done well because it was captured perfectly."
3202,8,"In the end, it's about love It's a superhero drama by way of ancient myth, so it's not the standard uplifting fair that people expect from Marvel. Describing how this film is different would require spoilers. And placing it in the pantheon of MCU films is difficult because of that difference. At times the gears and pulleys of the plot can be too visible, but I think they successfully did what they set out to do. And what works far outweighs what doesn't. I'll be watching it again."
3203,8,"Its not a rotten film Having just gotten back home from seeing the film, I honestly dont get the hate it was getting. Its certainly not a ""rotten film"". My biggest issue is that with it being a team movie vs a solo, I did feel there was a lot of backstory to set up. And unfortunetly I think some characters get more development than others. But I overall enjoyed it. I thought it had a good balance of action, comedy and emotion. And while I didnt cry, I nearly did with a certain scene involving Ikarus and Sersi. I also liked the character building done for Sprite. She reminded me of ""Claudia"" from Interview with the Vampire"" in a lot of ways. And I loved what it had to say around ""religion"" and blindy following your faith. I thought it was a very interesting and fascinating movie and definitely would be interested in expanding upon the mythos and characters. Not a perfect movie by any means. I would rank it, i dont know....maybe somewhere between 12-20. I'd possibly have to do some rewatches to get an exact number, but I think I can fairly say its not a top 10 film, nor is it bottom of the bunch. I'd rate this film a 7.5 (I rounded up to 8 here)."
3204,2,"Bland Introducing all these characters trying to establish them, have some what of an arc, and tell a decent story is a tall task. One that was not achieved. Very boring, story is nonsense, characters are shallow."
3205,3,"Short and simple review Boring, boring, boring, and boring. Disney clearly took over this movie. Watch it and that will make much more sense. Too many unnecessary scenes and almost every single character isn't interesting. The ending and many parts throughout the movie were head scratching and at some points I even laughed. Not laughing in a good way. Anyone who gives this movie anything over a 6. Hasn't watched a marvel movie before. I said short and sweet. So I will stop talking now. If I do, I might talk myself into a lower score. 3/10 is a score I'm comfortable giving."
3206,9,"Do Not Listen to the 1 star reviews knocking it for simple diversity This was honestly such an enjoyable movie from start to finish. The visuals are stunning, some of the best Marvel has produced. The action is epic and almost Superman-esque with is something we have yet to see in the MCU. Very unique and enjoyable century-spanning story that sets it apart from all other Marvel movies. Perhaps the most impressive part, however, is that they were able to introduce 10 brand new characters and give them each their own different, interesting and enjoyable personalities. Marvel really steps out of their comfort zone with this one, which must be appreciated. Great acting all around, great cinematography and great action. I can't wait to see where these characters stories go from here."
3207,5,"Better than Venom 2, not as good as Black Widow or Shang Chi The cinematics are spectacular in this movie.. no one will argue that.The rest of the movie is a bit slow, and somewhat dragged out. It got so slow I started to doze off. This movie is no ""character(s) story"" compared to iron man 1, captain America, Thor, or Spider-Man's homecoming. A lot of unnecessary screen time dragging out parts of the movie, with very little on-screen connection to anything currently going on in the MCU, other than verbal reference.Best part of the movie was the last half hour, and post-movie/credits scenes.This isn't one of those marvel movies I'll watch again and again. Be realistic about your expectations going into this if you're going to spend money seeing it in IMAX."
3208,8,And just like that I wasn't prepared to be moved to tears but there I was.Thought provoking.Engaging Not predictable Deep and moving Just what I needed Would recommend A.
3209,8,"FROM A NON-MARVEL FAN I've never been invested in the MCU, so this is coming from someone who isn't comparing it to every other Marvel movie.The scenes and sets from ancient civilizations were unbelievable. Truly I could have watched entire movies just exploring them. To be honest they were so good that it felt kind of jarring to watch the Eternals in their superhero getup walking around them, like if you added aliens to the Harry Potter-verse or something. It just kind of clashed.The Celestials and space scenes were incredible too, and the golden geometric aesthetics of their powers were sooo pretty, much more visually pleasing than the usual metal and fire explosions you normally see with superheroes.The plot was definitely slow, but the one by one introductions to each of the characters modern day lives was interesting and made up for the lack of plot development. However once everyone was introduced i feel like the plot started to go downhill to the point where i was kind of bored through the final fight sequence.It's apparent to me at least that Marvel put a lot more effort into filming locations, special effects and getting big name actors than they put into the plot line and story telling, which is unfortunate as the concept in general could expand indefinitely for future movies so hopefully marvel fans can look past that before they write this movie off as a flop.Gemma Chan was not a good choice for the lead role. Her acting and vibes were bland to the point where the character was boring and forgettable even though she was supposed to be the center of the movie, She didn't have the presence the movie needed for a main character, and the story fell flat because of it.I really liked Kumail Nanjiani's performance as Kingo, he def added life to what otherwise would probably have been a bland group dynamic. Druig's character was interesting, but I felt he could have had a more complex role and I'm hoping he has more going for him in the next movie. I absolutely LOVED how the Eternals communicated with Makkari in sign language, I thought that was a great affition to the movie and dynamics between the characters."
3210,8,"Eternals Rocks! Where to start? The film is a work of love and an homage to Marvel, both past and present, with an amazing story. Can't wait to see it on the home theatre. Directing, story telling and pacing were amazing. Kept grabbing my wife's hand throughout, and had to consciously release my fingers. I was curious how Angelina Jolie would do, and she brings everything home with Thena bringing balance with vulnerability of the ultimate warrior,looking forward to her appearances. I cared about all of the characters with their flaws, which made it seem all the more clear, they were a part of humanity, imprinted by those they were watching."
3211,9,"Amazing movie, so much story! I only ask that you base you judgement on it as a movie, I'll give my plot review in a few weeks after everyone has time to see it...Base a marvel movie on all the other movies made at the time and marvel wins. Story, cinematography, special effects, humor, drama. Then add in the intertwining of all the MCU, and detailed origins for all characters."
3212,1,Go watch Dune instead The Eternals is so awful. The worst MCU film ever. Way too long and way too boring. Horrible story and plot. Go watch Dune in theaters instead if you want to support a diverse cast of characters done right.
3213,8,"Vastly impressed, despite strong hesitation I did not know how to feel about this movie going in, just based on the trailers. Frankly, the trailers were abysmal. The feature was anything but in my opinion. I was surprised in the best way. Introducing that many new characters at the same time in one movie is obviously a challenge, but I feel they managed to pull it off quite well.The film cast well known stars like Hayek and Jolie, but doesn't rely on them to carry the movie. It does however use flashbacks as an anchor and progression point to push the scenes forward, and at times add a twist or two. But it wouldn't be a Marvel film without some lightheartedness in it, using Kumail Nanjiani for some of the comic relief, which he naturally exhumes.The visuals are absolutely stunning, from the vast landscapes, space, the powers and monsters. The antagonist(s) were one of the vague areas the trailers did not want to advertise, to which I don't truly understand why, but letting that go and watching the movie has me wanting more.Two post credit scenes, both of which have a reveal, followed by a tease, because of course. They aren't bad, but the second shows less than I'd have liked. But that could just be me.The characters are full, they are fun, and they are unique in who they are in this Marvel universe. I come out of the theater excited to see what comes next."
3214,10,"Golden times for the MCU The characters are well developed and the plot is exciting and engaging, I'm in love with Druig and Makkari, beside the discussions are so real and valuable, can't wait to see more of theses characters!!"
3215,8,"Purpose Like every origin story, The Eternals are no different from the slow start that focuses on each character which allows the viewer to care about them throughout the movie. Marvel has a purpose to every movie, which links everything together. Give this movie a chance and understand the process of what is going on, the bigger picture starts to come clear."
3216,6,"Some unexpected twists but not enough two and a half hour Eternals starts with a text explaining the creation of the world and the reason of the Eternals; but the last line says everything changed after the last mission.Then the movie goes to 5000 BC when the seven Eternals arrived, fight some DEVIANT monsters and are introduced. Then moves to present day London where two of them (Sersi and Sprite) interact with humans; but DEVIANTS (who should have been extinct) appears; so they have to fight again.Considering danger is coming back decided reunite the group again. That was pretty much what the trailer showed and takes the first half of the movie giving some screen time to each other character, a real love story and a few suggested. This first half is slow paced and low on action. Some small fights and twists are not enough to keep interest.Suddenly a reveal occurs (not totally unexpected considering the last line of text in the introduction) but turns the movie in something more interesting.Another reveal by the third act turns the story darker (not on the DC COMICS level) but betrayals are resolved too fast predictable; as it is the final fight.The acting do not help at all; Richard Madden has three facial expressions and one of them is when rays come out his eyes. Gemma Chan does not show personality to become the leader and her final showdown is too simple.Salma Hayek is Ok as a motherly leader, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Kit Haringtong are always fun to watch but their screen time is short compared with the first two.Barry Keoghan is the most interesting character and personality here. I saw him in other movies and is an interesting, very deep actor.Angelina Jolie is a surprise. She barely speaks in the first half and her character has little screen time. She is always good but is secondary or even tertiary character here.Last but not least; the script has a lot of holes. Some parts like the DEVIANTs reason to exist does not hold any logic.I have the feeling some things were changed on the editing room. There are trailer scenes that has been changed or eliminated.In any case, by the end there are some spectacular images and few comic moments thanks to Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry.It is not easy to give enough time to seven characters; but some better effort could have been done and took time out of the love story. Is my opinion.In brief; is long not lots of action and a mix of interesting ideas and failed ones. It is your decussation."
3217,9,"People Seem To Forget This Is A Superhero Movie... ... critiquing it for lacking in some way. Folks! We should rejoice that these movies aren't just Bruckhiemer blast fests full of hairy-chested one-liners. The fact this SUPERHERO MOVIE is getting bashed like it was supposed to be the next Scorsese is a testament both to the Marvel Hype Engine (please leave my Instagram alone Marvel. I get it. Your movie's out.) and to the actual greatness of this movie.Having to give critique I'd say maybe chill out with all the posing; standing like that in real life all the time would certainly lead to chronic back trouble, even eternally-speaking. And I wanna say it was rushed but that can't be in a movie so long...But I mean c'mon people. This movie was huge and it was small. Poignant and refreshing. I've never seen Zhao's other work but this is very obviously DIFFERENT in the way that James Gunn's Guardians were/are DIFFERENT. Something in the way. The tapestry of it. The tactility of the movie, if you feel me. And yes, It told an amazing story but just as importantly for the MCU, it'll be a basis for all the future stories.I hope all y'all's BS'n don't ruin Chloe's chances at a comeback: I for one, am STOKED for the next Eternals and THE BLACK KNIGHT."
3218,8,"The Past. The Present. The Future. Whilst the plentiful use of monologue and complex and at some times convoluted plot may dampen the experience for some, The Eternals is a testimony to future things to come in the MCU, giving us the greatest look into the past that the MCU has had since Guardians of The Galaxy, and also a double dose of what to look forward to in the future. An extensive look into the history and origins or the universe and earth is ever present throughout the film, perhaps too much for some people liking, but for fans hoping for more theories and branches to the MCU, perhaps not enough and perhaps opening more doors of opportunity and confusion than the MCU and it's fans were ready for. The action sequences speak for themselves, beautifully crafted and choreographed, emotionally charged at points, and full of surprise and tension. Perhaps more than other MCU entries to date, you may find yourself on the edge of your seat. For some, the action may not be frequent enough, but it can only be agreed upon that when it is there, it is brilliant. Plot holes do loom in the film but not to an extent that harshens the progression of the film, however some unanswered questions and odd behaviour do complicate the plot from a viewers perspective, but it is nothing that the film gets stuck in the mud over. The visuals and cinematography live up to what you expect from the trailer with fabulous scenery and eye catching sets, The Eternals does not fade away from being extravagant. The film does a sound job developing character and gives wonderful unique aspects to all of its large ensemble, mixing comedy with tragedy, and action with recount. It is safe to say, for those who enjoy the intricacies of a shared universe, this film will be very satisfying. It is safe to say that fans of the cosmic MCU will be pleased. And it is safe to say that fans of the emotional and character side of the MCU will walk away with glee. But for those who may find it all a bit too over the top, or long, or slow at times, The Eternals may feel slightly underwhelming. Marvel Studios: The Eternals, 8/10."
3219,9,"Frankly, I'm Shocked Perhaps its because I had my expectations set so low, or maybe I'm just a sucker for a universe-building movie, but I can honestly say that I absolutely adore this film. After seeing the mass criticism of ""Eternals,"" I did expect to enjoy the film from an audience standpoint, just not a critical one. But, ever since I left the theater, I've been scratching my head trying to figure out why this film has been so bombarded with negative reviews.For starters, the film dives into some remarkably deep topics that I haven't seen in many movies, especially nothing from the MCU. Most deep conversations and emotional connections in cinema deal with love, death or discrimination. Eternals manages to pull in the audience's attention by showing us the beauty of life as we know it, something director Chloé Zhao does amazingly. The film doesn't feel like an MCU episode, and I'm honestly glad it didn't. THIS is where Marvel begins branching out to create beautiful new ideas.Something that really stood out to me was Thena's arc. Yes, it was well written, but we mainly have Angelina Jolie to thank for Thena's emotional rollercoaster. Jolie proves once again just how well she can put on a preformance, and thus Thena's journey ends up being one of the most beautiful parts of the film. Likewise, you could make a case for almost any of the Eternals to end up as your favorite.Perhaps the film's one flaw, being a little more humor than necessary, holds it back from being a 10/10 addition to Marvel, but even those humorous moments add a lively atmosphere to the scenes.There isn't much more I can say without spoiling any major plot points, but as of my first viewing, I'm quite shocked at how beautiful, tragic and well done this film is. I'm disappointed to see the negative reception it's received."
3220,9,Don't Believe The Bad Reviews! An excellent film that Marvel fans will love! Really enjoy all the characters and fight sequences. The story is really well written and moves at a good pace for being a longer film.
3221,1,I walked out Bored boring.... Uninteresting and the acting was bad. Disappointed unfortunately. Wouldn't recommend. Stick with Spiderman. This is not it at all. Don't care if it's different or whatever. It's just it's boring and bad.
3222,6,"I fell asleep halfway through. I even drank a Monster right before since I knew it would be slow. I woke up a minute or two later. There is nothing MCU or exceptional outside of the mid-credit scene, in that regard it lives up to the source material but without Kirby's kinetic story telling."
3223,7,"Pretty good and excited for what's up come Definitely getting bashed by idiots for the wrong reasons. Did the character differences (Referring to making one of the eternals a Gay character) have to be in the film... NO. Did it take anything away from it or make the movie bad... Absolutely NOT!!! It was still a great story. Pretty jammed pack with stuff introducing so many new faces and explaining the origin stories. However, it set some good things up and I'm very excited to see what is next for most of them and how this will mold the next phase for the MCU. Now let's bring on spidey!!!!!"
3224,4,"Go in with low expectations so you don't punch a wall 1) Its a trainwreck in general.2) Its tonally inconsistent...worse in that category than Age of Ultron. Bet you never thought you'd see dead corpse zombie Salma Hayek, did you?3) It looks like they never did a second take on anything. I don't think the actors/actresses were given direction. The characters and their emotions were all over the place. Ajak seems all charming then says ""know your role"" to Icharus with an evil stare. What is that crap?4) The characters are all shallow, save for Gemma Chan's. Zero character depth.5) The ending is straight out of a HISHE skit. The celestial pops up to say hi like Deadpool and then disappears.6) Vomit inducing end credit scene where we meet a guy who looks like Shrek and his friend Star Fox...yes...STAR FOX.7) Eternals will return...UGH."
3225,8,"Critics Suck Make Your Own Opinion This movie wasn't the worst marvel movie but it definitely wasn't the best the pacing was a little slow but the cinematography Stunning Visuals and Diverse hilarious Cast makes the movie worth seeing and definitely doesn't deserve the hate, but that's my opinion it honestly you should see the movie yourself in Imax for picture and sound quality."
3226,7,"Too many review-bombers. Go see it for yourself. Individuals who are choosing to overwhelmingly rate this film 1 star are being dishonest with themselves and the rest of users. Eternals suffers from pacing issues, but makes up for it with a stellar cast and some stand-out performances. Couple that together with a lackluster 1st act and an incredibly strong 3rd, and you find yourselves with an MCU film that is certainly not stronger than it's counterparts, but also, far from the worst. Go see the movie and quit hopping on the hate-train-bandwagon."
3227,9,"DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO CRITICS This film is nothing like critics say, this film is ambitious in many ways, visually is prefect, the actors are great! The surprises are so unexpected, the only ""bad"" thing is that the film is too long and sometimes a bit slow. The film is so far of being the worst and also far of being the best MCU film."
3228,1,"Big Budget Fail Can I get my money back? Went into movie with low expectations but I guess it was not low enough. Even Thor the Dark World beats the pacing of this movie. Never have I seen a bigger waste of a great cast. Looking for a good mid credit scene? Nah it only reassures you that this movie is garbage. I'm a die hard Marvel fan and this is making me question every future marvel movie after Endgame. I get that some people may like this movie but they are probably below the age of 6. Anybody older will be bored to death and will be facepalming their entire way through this movie. Please Marvel remember what made you fun to watch. Not some deep boring story directed with no artistic flare but an action movie with super powers. The only super power in this movie is super boredom. Would not recommend this movie even when I'm baked, and that's saying something. Please Spider-Man restore my faith in Marvel."
3229,9,One of the Best Marvel Movies Critics are tripping so hard. Or maybe they want more forced jokes and formulaic scripts.This movie is amazing. One of the best Marvel movies to date.
3230,2,"Worst Marvel Movie Ever It's a long winding story telling, script, inconsistencies and average acting. Only saving grace was Angelina Jolie and her scenes where she talks and moves less but still able to shine through."
3231,10,AJAK & THENA I came to watch for Ajak and Thena and I was not disappointed. Salma Hayek played Ajak so well. Angelina Jolie executed Thena to perfection. The rest if the cast was phenomenal. I'm so proud of everyone involved in the making of this wonderful masterpiece.
3232,9,Top and missed The movie is enjoyable there's some moments where your mouth will be opened cause is shocking the movie have some bad point but can't say it's worst marvel movie.
3233,8,"Epic and spectacular movie!!! Now, this movie Is the best of the 4th phase of MCU, grafic, scenary and Battle are so incredible!!! It Is amuse from beginning to end. The plot Is original and compelling, the caracters designs are factional and they have a good reasons. (Only one thing doesn't me like but it is so difficult to explain without spoiler) final clash is fantastic and the end it isn't trival. Good story, good meter, good direction, screenplay and photography.Positively impressioned."
3234,8,"Will split the room. I really liked it Without a doubt the most visually stunning and drama rich marvel film. The VFX are on another level, although the finale is a bit too ""grand"" for lack of a better word, the first 90% of the movie for the most part was quite grounded and slower than most MCU movies which was very welcome as it suited the style of this story and characters, plus gave us something new and refreshing to the franchise.The big finale was classic Disney, in a way that was a little disappointing, a massive CGI sequence that felt a bit out of place from the rest of this brave movie, they somewhat chickened out and were too afraid to let the film climax on its own terms. A very in-your-face reminder that MCU have a formula, there are a few moments like this.I stilled loved it, the speedster looked so good The Flash movie really has to bring it to satisfy now. The amount of beautiful shots have no right to be in a MCU movie it was wonderful. The deep and complicated relationships within a diverse and interesting group of characters makes the movie immersive and relatable. It also has some profound questions at its core. I can't wait to see these characters again, Phase 4 has completely exceeded my expectations so far.One terrible after credit scene that made me very nervous for the future of the MCU (not funny or cool). And a second one that is really intriguing and exciting."
3235,8,"I don't understand how this movie is ""dense"" So many critics and reviewers here said this movie is ""dense"" or there is alot to ""unpack"". I don't get it. The story is very straightforward, little to no exposition.Most of the movie is about the drama between the characters and them finding out more about the ""Emergence"". And the twist at the midpoint of the movie is really the only big exposition dump, and it's like 3 minutes and actually quite interesting.I liked it. It was entertaining to me. I liked the lore expansion alot, it made sense to me. And I'm a sucker for lore.The biggest weakness of the movie to me, and others will feel totally different about this, is that I couldn't root for the Eternals. The movie didn't present an alternate solution to Arishem's plan to create a new Eternal and with it trillions of lives. Without an alternative what the Eternals are doing is just selfish to me. Safe Billions and prevent trillions from existing and also help the universe fall into darkness. To me the Eternal's decision was the wrong one here. It's definitely a dilemma, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth.Anyway, contrary to many others, I liked the Deviants. Their purpose wasn't to be the movie's antagonists, not at all. It was to show that the Deviants and the Eternals weren't so different, and after the ""Prime Deviant"" got Ajaks powers (free will as a part of it) we see that his objective changes. His objective is no longer to follow their creators design to kill all live on earth, but rather to protect his kind from the ones that want to harm them: The Eternals. I liked this. The Eternals are not the ""bad guys of this movie"". Actually, there isn't one. The movie is one big moral dilemma.Not everything worked well, but I'll give this a solid 8. It's not a dense movie."
3236,5,"Good idea , Bad execution I just watched the movie ! Spoiler alert!First of all , I really liked the idea of Eternals! The cause of their existence and how it is explained throughout the movie!It was really interesting at the beginning and those visuals were great.However , the main characters didn't develop as much as I want to! I didn't get the feeling like the other Marvel movies. Not to mention Cerci was nothing special as a character.The relationship of the main characters wasn't developed too.-I love you Icarus -I love you Cerci And that was it! No feelings nothing!The Chinese guy died and Angelina didn't even cared lol 😂 Moreover , they were fighting those creatures all movie and in the end only one appeared and i wasn't really hyped about the fight.To sum up , they could have done a much better job and this movie has a lot of potential!I would like to watch the second one and I hope they will fill the gap holes from this movie."
3237,1,This is the weakest part of the Marvel Universe - Celestials & Eternals. Thanks to Celestials through Eternals for bringing us inteligence on Earth :))) What a sh_tshow... Waste of talented actors.I personally believe this chapter in the Marvel's outter universe is silly and leaks imagination.
3238,3,"May be better suited to the DC universe. So let me start by saying I am a fan. Comics have played an integral part of my life growing up with the likes of Spiderman, The Avengers and Doctor Strange among too many more to list, and I remember back in the 80's and 90's, studio attempts at making poor films like Spiderman and Captain America. I also remember being so excited when I had the chance to watch them, but also disappointed they didn't live up to the imaginative creativity of the original comic books. How could they?The lack of technology, cgi, special effects and budget constraints (back then, no one wanted to see superhero films). With that, we were satisfied with what we got, because we knew it was the best we could get for the time.Fast forward a couple of decades and we now expect much more. We have been spoiled with amazing adaptations of comics we loved in our youth, and they are brought to life on screen with the same creativity and passion we loved them for. The Avengers saga, Spiderman films, Thor, Ant Man, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Captain Marvel, to name a few, all living up to expectations and sometimes exceeding them.Then there is the Eternals. What feels like a cash grab riding on the coattails of Marvels success. A CGI extravaganza that pushes the 2 and half hour limit, but could have been shorter or longer (depending on who was making it). In the hands of Chloe Zhao, it feels like it was falling through her fingers. Don't get me wrong, technically the film looks good. But the film feels forced at times and hollow at others. The characters, although well defined are boring and waning in their own existence. The potential was there. I liked some of what I saw, but I left the cinema feeling annoyed, unloved, taken for a ride. I expected more. And I have a right to expect more because I have seen what Marvel films bring to the table, and I am familiar with the feeling and emotion I get from those other films, that take care and show love for the material.If the Eternals come back for another film, I don't know if I'd care for it. It would require a whole new direction for me to be interested to go back for another foray."
3239,2,"Boring storyline I was excited to see this movie however its just another Marvel buildup. This movie takes MCU in interesting directions, but really boring as an independent film. Performances, visuals are all okay. Overall its a below average movie."
3240,10,"The new Marvel Eternals is beautiful shooting, the colors, the background.Show us a new universe, with its own mythology and tone, the Watchers of Marvel MCU (but PG-13 ) .Something refreshing vs some of the past (funny all the way ) movies."
3241,9,Different marvel movie This movie is a very different movie from the other marvel films. Almost refreshing in a way there are a lot of people criticizing it for lack of screen time for some big actors when the actors they want to see more of aren't the main focus of the film. There are a few twists in there to throw you off! I would definitely see this movie again and I cannot wait for the next eternals movie!
3242,10,"What an amazing film Ignore the bad reviews, this movie is my favorite marvel movie yet! Soooooooo great! Great story, beautiful CGI and incredible actors, top notch MCU!Just ignore the bad reviews!Go watch this movie!"
3243,7,"Its a pretty decent film but... As there are ten new heroes to introduce, it does not allow enough screen time to introduce the audience to all of them properly, which leads to people not really feeling connected with the characters due to lack of this characterization.Its a problem with all team based hero movies to some extent. Avengers were fine as mostly they were introduced with their own films. Guardians worked because it revolved around Starlord as a primary character and the other characters were sort of introduced in the periphery. But the Eternals tries to introduce them all in one go, and give a small piece of development before the action sequences, so you don't really get time to learn them and feel for their character.But apart from that its a pretty generic film, writing wise. It does have more of a DC vibe to it than most Marvel films. Good CGI, decent performances, but character development was off which lead to a somewhat disinterested viewing."
3244,10,"Beats expectations by an extreme margin A horrible trailer full of cgi enemies created a misconception/fear that there would be a pointless army with cannon fodder cgi deviants, as has happened too often with Marvel movies.None of that, combined with great acting from certain cast members that were most definitely not expected to be able to and an amazing set up and expanse of celestial lore, make for an amazing movie.I can not take most critics serious over here. Go see the movie for yourself before judging. And please do so in Imax 3D. The cgi and choreography are epic."
3245,7,"Another Good MCU Phase 4 Movie But... This is a Most Controversial MCU Films i Watch, 2 Hour 37 Minutes is Very Longest MCU Movie after Avengers: Endgame, There's Something Gay/LGBTQ+ Superhero Members, and A Lowest Rating for Rotten Tomatoes. That's Sucked ;(, The Design Costume so Awesome, Story is Incredible/Epic and Special Effect so Amazing.Rating: 7/10."
3246,5,"First impression I am in the middle of the movie and i am writing the review.........First of all, congratulations for the work and the effort of everyone from the production.The movie is very good visually, but doesn't have the progression and the dynamics to keep you in your seat as the other MCU movies. Lacks the spirit of Iron man 1.I know that the characters are too strong and developed for their time on Earth and can't develop more than they had, but still something is missing. I don't feel the need to wait for the end of the movie. I just wait to see what they have created.Can't wait to see SPIDEY."
3247,10,"Amazing visuals and philosophical concepts! Not only is the Eternals a visual masterpiece, the inner challenges each of the eternals face is a great signifier of the MCU moving into a more mature, meaningful phase.When you look deeper into the plot and each events significance, and appreciate the detail put into a timeline that spans thousands of years, the low underwhelming ratings seem obviously out of place. And despite the fact that many people loved the MCU as a couple of buff guys and over-sexualised women, the transition the MCU is going through is inevitable, as a franchise that has supported generations, and quite frankly awesome.Besides from the stunning visuals and deep undertones Chloe Zhao certainly packs in enough fight scenes as possibly needed. Each eternal represents a unique power, connected through their source of cosmic energy. This variability allows for exhilarating fight scenes that are arguably more interesting than a couple of punches, kicks and the stray flying weapon. The love stories are quaint and meaningful, and certainly don't take up too much of the run time.Overall, the new age of maturity and deeper concepts seen in this movie is most definitely something to look forward to in Phase 4!"
3248,1,"Same old formula Worn out, tired, out of ideas and inspiration. The Marvel franchise is dead in the water, with the new movies having little to offer except the same old origin story formula. Everything else about these films just gets worse. The CGI gets louder and more obnoxious, the writing gets worse, the plot holes get bigger and without Robert Downey Jr or Chris Pratt, there is a major lack of charisma that hasn't been bridged.The marvel movies feel like a TV show past its prime. Everyone knows it has nowhere to go, but they still watch it out of habit.Eternals is possibly the worst of this year's 3 Marvel films, and that's saying something. Primarily because it feels so bloated. Black Widow at least had a semi decent first act."
3249,1,"A boring blockbuster Chloé Zhao has just won an Oscar and his next work shows how limited it really is to work at UCM. Developing 10 characters in a movie is practically impossible, Zhao tries but clearly can't. His inexperience in CGI is also visible. The editing of the film is very poorly done, a real mess. In the end the movie is not fun and no character is well developed for anyone to care about."
3250,7,"Was good. Better than the ""critics"" say. It was a good movie. Good performance, good deed, maybe the story and rhythm had to be polished a little more, but it's definitely not a bad movie.I hope to see a sequel soon. The story literally remained in a thread."
3251,9,"Spectacular! What a wonderful movie! Beautiful scenes, full-of-imagine super powers, the unexpected twists, the belief in the goodness of human, the power of love...as a Marvel fan, i love it so much."
3252,7,"It's Pretty goddamn good Alright so this is a pretty good movie. I watched it in IMAX and it was absolutely amazing. Would I rewatch? No, at least not any time soon.The beginning is great, it gave me chills. The CGI is good for the most part. At one point there is a conflict between the eternals which is kind of dumb but it makes sense. One of the characters does do something really stupid at the end though.It takes a different approach, it doesn't have the same 3 act structure which has been critiqued for Marvel movies.Overall it's a fun time and a good movie."
3253,10,Perfect treat. A perfect treat to every marvel fan. Dont go for the negative reviews. Excellent movie with excellent story line and actors. Marvel never disappoint there fans. Its a must watch movie. )10/10)
3254,10,"As a standalone it works really well, but my disappointment is that they didn't go how mutants in marvel can be exist . Cinematic and the fights were very super , the story wasn't a problem for me because I'm interested in real story and I also Before knowing about Eternals. In the whole movie there was no knowledge about mutants and that disappointed me very much, the Eternals are here weakness 3 of them died and that's good so they don't get overpowered. But one big thing that bothers me in all mcu films is that a lot of disasters happen and none of the superheroes (so like avengers has come). In the end I found that this film is very, very good as a standalon, which I really liked, but it just doesn't fit into this earth where our avengers are settled, so I hope from marvel in the future that they will settle films in other parallel universes like waht we see in waht if let ."
3255,10,"It was amazing It is definitely different from the rest of Marvel movies, a bit more slow paced but then again you get so much content. You get to know the Eternals and their mission. Also just how much this movie sets up for the future is astonishing.The diversity is unmatched and probably why this movie gets a lot of hate even before being released. The showcase of different people of color, disabilities and sexual orientation - just incredible and I'm so happy a lot of people will get a superhero that is just like them!This movie will definitely not suite everyone's needs but don't discredit it as it's just a beautiful work of art. The characters are all well casted and their performances were great. And most definitely you don't want to miss the mid and end credits scenes!"
3256,3,"just watch Guardians vol 2 So essentially the plot of this movie is the celestials plant seeds in planets that grow into other celestials and destroy planets. That's literally just Guardians 2. Other issue i had was the movie tells the story like a ADHA kid, back and forth with timeline for absolutely no story value. Just wait for Disney +"
3257,1,"I have never been more bored in my life Once infinity war ended so did the MCU. This stagnate pretensions ""sci fi fantasy"" borefest is the reason why the mcu and superhero movies have run their coarse. This movie has no story and is filled with the most basic and bland characters in the history of film. This is three hours of the same stock CGI effects we've seen a million times with awkward and unfunny comedic breaks that are just stale as the characters who constantly go into redundant philosophical monologues that make no sense. It's the same tired marvel formula that puts nothing at stake and is devoid of any conflict. This is a dull film that was written by a boardroom and made by an assembly line powered by a soulless corporation who is more concerned about profits than good storytelling."
3258,9,"An excellent film that deepens the mythology of the MCU The film respects the story that Jack Kirby created and still uses elements from various comics that explore all these characters. Some characters undergo changes both physically and in their personalities, but it's something that suits the MCU.The representation of the characters makes a big difference in the film, the multiple ethnicities and ideologies make the group really look diverse.The villains have their point of view somehow logical, and when you see the cosmic big picture it makes their actions make sense. In addition to answering questions about Thanos' motivations, we get you thinking about how the Marvel universe will turn out. Giving a touch of Lovecraft and reflection to Marvel."
3259,2,"Too Many Characters and Director Mismatch Chloe Zhao is talented and should get more projects in the future, maybe even another Marvel movie. But Eternals was a bad mismatch with Chloe's directing style, worsened further by having to introduce 10 characters.The movie is simultaneously too long and too short. If they wanted to properly tell the story with all 10 characters it needed to be a mini-series, not a movie. Alternatively to adapt it as a movie they should have focused on introducing a handful of characters and in a sequel they could have introduced the rest.As is the movie never stops introducing new characters or new exposition. It's sadly the worst MCU movie I've seen and the first I've wanted to walk out on due to boredom."
3260,8,"With impressive photography and a tone of hope, Eternals surprises and thrills, but it could have shown us even more the strength of these superheroes so powerful. Eternals is a movie full of love that starts out interesting from the beginning, but that's about it. ""Interesting"" is the keyword for the feature, which takes a long time to get emotional (unlike other Marvel Studios films), but impresses audiences in a calmer way by presenting the vast power of each of the group's members. Super heroes with a wonderful CGI that gives beauty to the film. But don't get confused, it would be unfair to say that Eternals is bad for its slower tone, something different from other films in the franchise. The story is intriguing, enigmatic and holds the viewer to the screen, but the fights full of mystical powers and magic take time to get relevance to the plot and, when they do, they don't show all the giant power that the group of Eternals possess. Regardless of how calm the film is, it's impossible to say that it's serious and dark like the DC Extender Universe features, as some critics have pointed out, as it has a few puns and a certain comedic tone, even if it sometimes comes out of the blue. Eternals is a beautiful film and it deals very well with the issue of diversity, especially with Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), an openly gay character, and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who is hearing impaired and wonderfully well produced, but can seem calm. Too much for Marvel Studios. Chloé Zhao did a beautiful job, something totally different from anything seen on the MCU, regardless of whether it's good or bad..."
3261,2,"So the bad reviews are true.. As a MCU fan, after one hour I was just so disappointed and bored. I couldn't believe someone approved this after all the movies who came before. Was expecting Marvel to have already figured out a formula for making an enjoyable movie for all kind of viewers, but wrong I was.I don't want to mention things already talked by others, but I feel like few are mentioning how bad this movie was edited also. You can clearly see there is no continuity between the different takes in fight scenes and it ruins all the immersion.All in all, I'm mostly disappointed, considering that even the TV series they released are much better crafted together than this hyped movie."
3262,10,"Great world building 😍 Before you watch , you should understand that this isn't the same format of basic marvel movies. This is a different approach from MCU. This is basically a world building story with and some action😎 . MCU is introducing different cosmic aspect. So,this a new beginnings. This movie will create a layout for future. So,this will not be perfect. You have to open your mind to understand 😊.Besides,I really enjoy .The great cinematography, action and new heros are for future events😍💙.But not a great story 😌.Still ,i will give 10/10. Because i really enjoy it.It is definitely worth of your time.So,you should watch it.Thanks you....💙💙"
3263,9,"Excellent superhero movie and much better than I thought Superhero movies are so many now and they seem to pop up almost every month so I think most of us are getting jaded. However once in a while a real gem show us why we still love the genre and Eternals is one of those.This is so surprisingly great that I gave it a 9/10 which is the highest I given anything superhero-y in a very, very long time. Acting is fantastic, directing great, music score amazing, set pieces and sets lovely. The movie is cinematography porn mixed with great characters, brilliant writing and superb entertainment.Two things bothered me. First of many of the little quips or ""jokes"" are often very out of place. This is a great masterful movie with space Gods, galaxies and amazing technology, and it is also a bit dark and grittier than you might think so those ""jokes"" seldom land very well. This is definitely a Marvel-sickness they need to get rid off, way too much of that in this movie. The second thing is that the movie is too short. I know most people will claim otherwise, and most reviewers will say it is too long or have slow pacing, but I completely disagree. This is so amazingly done that I want 2 hours more, plus there are a lot of characters and we need to get to know them better. I want Eternals 2 now!There are two end credit scenes, both are a bit too comic-y so if you do not know who these characters are or know the lore you might miss a few things.This is one of the best superhero movies Marvel has done, I would put it just below the two or three top movies. I had very low expectations so that might have helped my score and surprise enjoyment, but this is very well done. Top marks in all categories and extremely high production value. 9/10 and I highly recommend."
3264,10,"A very different way to create something new MCU needs to evolve and eternals is the movie that made it possible with great characters, visuals, cast direction.The passage between present and past is very useful to explain things that happen and all the background storyline of the 10 main characters. For example, Phastos caratteristics as his love for humans and the following discover of the tragedy that his help along centuries created are explained in a awesome way.Maybe MCU fandom wasn't ready for this type of movie, but I hope to see more movies like this soon."
3265,4,"Eternals seems a bit too separate from the rest of the Marvel film series. Eternals is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and part written by Chloé Zhao, the director of The Rider and Nomadland.The film is about a group of aliens called Eternals, who have been protecting humanity from evil creatures called Deviants since the beginning. Since the defeat of this evil, the Eternals have remained hidden on Earth without further affecting the lives of humanity, but after an unexpected tragedy, the Eternals must spring back into action to investigate this tragedy. Most are sure that this can only mean that the Deviants return to Earth.With this film, Chloé Zhao and fellow screenwriters introduce a new group of creatures to the Marvel film series. Due to the large unfamiliarity of this group and the fact that the co-screenwriters are at the beginning of their careers, this film may seem unclear to people who are otherwise unfamiliar with the Eternals. The reason that they only now appear in the film series also seems a bit forced and the film is also very separate from the rest of the Marvel film series. Only a few characters from the film series are mentioned by name, making this film almost as connected as the Marvel Netflix series.The story can also be tricky to follow, as it often jumps from the present to the past to give some brief explanations about certain things that come up later in the film. Furthermore, the Eternals observe humanity more and sometimes give their assessment. Chloé Zhao seems to have done this so that as a viewer you also get a kind of history lesson about the good and bad sides of humanity. In this way the film loses its entertaining side and it almost comes across as a kind of argument. The film also lacks real suspense, as this only comes when suddenly and Deviant shows up to cause some chaos. Marvel producer Kevin Feige may have been a little dazzled with arranging for Chloé Zhao as director after she broke into the film world last year after winning two Oscars. Chloé Zhao manages to capture a few scenes nicely, but these are the scenes that were filmed on location. Other scenes shot in the film studio seem less believable. The green screen is often clearly visible here, which makes the film lose its credibility. The CGI used for transferring the Deviants or the superpowers of the Eternals is often also clearly visible. These beings and powers do not always come across as credible. This film is the 26th film in the Marvel film series, which makes it special that after so many films, the effects suddenly seem to be less compared to most other films in the series. The film is also not necessary to see in 3D, because there are only a few scenes in which this effect can be seen.Due to the size of the film cast, the acting comes across as nice, but nobody really gets the chance to come across clearly as the main character of the film. All characters with their own powers and difficult names are difficult for the viewer to remember. At the end of the movie you don't know exactly who each character was and what they could do. Most characters are remembered more thanks to the actor who plays the character. Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani remain the most remembered for their fame, despite the fact that these big names didn't even get the most time in the film."
3266,1,Insult to the late Jack (King) Kirby Phastos is not an actual character in the Eternals comic series. Would it have hurt to review the source material before trying to adapt such a complex series to the big screen? Very disappointing and this will be the first Marvel film I will not be purchasing.
3267,9,A strong character display with an okay story The whole movie is so exciting and the relationship between the characters were portraited with a quite diligency. I enjoyed every moment of the film. But I think the story can be pushed a bit more to the edge. Although it was one of Chloe's great works!
3268,2,"All style and no substance I watched the movie because I am visiting a friendly family in Germany! And I'm damn disappointed! What should I write so that there are no many spoilers ?! Some compare it to Zack Snyder's Justice League, but that's not true at all! It's more like the Justice League, but the Joss Whedon's theatrical cut! Others compare it to Dune, only the latter is a much better film.There are really beautiful views in the movie, but as a story it's very bad! There is no other way, after so many new characters are presented in one movie! Playing with the religion of many people, as well as ""diversity"", at the expense of good history, are the big disadvantages of this film. And besides, this film tries to copy the characters of the DC Justice League almost entirely.I wouldn't watch this movie a second time even if it's free!I give it a rating of 2 out of 10, just because of the presence of Angelina Jolie, otherwise my rating would be 1 out of 10 !!!"
3269,10,"Those people are blind I think all the people who have given negative ratings don't know what a good movie is, and they don't know how to analyze a movie. They just rely on the fact that it was long with few action scenes. Indeed ,this is the first Marvel film not suitable for children, because to be able to understand the film, you need to have a slightly more open mind since the film focuses a lot on the psychological characterization of the characters. This film is much more complete than the others because it has a beginning, a development and an end, it tells a story of its own. It has dramatic parts that meke you move, and there is no longer the usual comedy of the previous marvel films, in short , it is no longer a film suitable for an audience of children and people who do not know about cinema. So it's normal in the end that it has all these negative evaluations, but it is sad.-italian guy."
3270,1,"Rip off So we have superman, wonder woman the flash and other watered down copies fighting dragons... So un-original... I cant believe marvel is that desperate... Cant they find original scripts anymore???"
3271,9,"Well, the critics are wrong on this one For starters, I'm a DC fan and I'll be honest, I was happy when I saw Eternals got the 'rotten rating' in Rotten Tomatoes but I really wanted to watch this cause I'm a fan of Chloe Zhao and I love her movies and her direction.First, This movie was epic, I had a blast watching this and I hope Marvel makes more movies like this. The performance was amazing, visuals, were fantastic actions sequences were dope. Gemma Chan's is the real MVP of this movie, not gonna spoil anything but her character Sersi is G. O. A. T.Another standout performance was given by Kumail. Najiani and Richard Madden. Other actors did a really good job but these two were standout for me. Another great character was Harish Patel who plays Kingo's valet, that guy was really fun and I hope we see him more in MCU.The only con I felt was the sex scene which I felt was absolutely unnecessary but other than that, this movie is really good. It's highly entertaining. Just forget about the critics and watch it."
3272,10,Expansive Great movie. Clearly expanding the MCU in ways we haven't seen before. Stylish shots and great character development. Nice CGI and soundtrack was spot on.
3273,1,"I fell asleep, don't believe any hype Straight up passed out about an hour into the movie. While it may be visually stunning it fails completely to draw you in to the characters in any way shape or form. This seems to be a pattern post Endgame, let's hope it doesn't continue, because it would be a shame to ruin a great Universe that has an enormous fan base."
3274,6,"I really wanted to enjoy this The visual effects are amazing but the film is unnecessarily long and really split off from the actual comic counterpart, they could have easily shaved off a good 30 minutes to this film and it would in my opinion at least have made a large difference, I almost hate to say this because I've been a marvel fan since the beginning but I find them taking to many gambles and not getting directly to the point , literally from the first phase of marvel we had an idea where this is going and since then they have literally created a different universe that I don't see being able to compete with the first 3 phases. Ask for the externals it was more of a drama / superhero film, anyways there was so much this film could of explored but chose not to and there answer to why they didn't help the avengers with thanos was almost like they didn't feel like it, or they couldn't intervene but other characters did intervene living there mundane human life, anyways for me I give it a 6 because it's worth a watch for the visual effects alone but I won't be watching this one again anytime soon."
3275,4,"mediocre film trying to develop too many characters While having one of the most diverse cast it fails to develop 80% of the characters properly. The characters are so bland you see them dealing with these complex thoughts only to instantly forget about it after a peptalk. It has been done so many times that the writers put a one liner in there, pointing it out for anyone still oblivious how easily they put aside any struggle they were having.The film takes its humor from a few characters walking around dropping one liners but add nothing else to the story. Towards the end, one of the Eternals even leaves seconds before the climax to later return out of nowhere but his character was so meaningless I barely noticed he was gone.The CGI was decent but nothing spectecular you could even see where they cut from CGI to live set a few times.The story flows weirdly jumping back and forth in timelines and none of the plot twists came as shocking. The story is pretty much an Invincible copied Marvel film.Some characters were really interesting and could do well with a 2nd movie exploring and developing them more but for now they're so one dimensional each character only plays one role in the film.The scenes itself were visually beautiful but don't make up for the lack in story, underdeveloped characters and overall a weird flow of the film. Eternals quickly crashed down into one of the weakest Marvel films on my list."
3276,9,"A fresh view on marvel film Chloe Zhang did a great job in creating this movie, and the actor's acting only complemented the film as a whole. The surprising twist and wholesome relationship of the characters were the perfect aspects of this film. And, may I say, WOMEN-"
3277,6,"Poetic art realism + Hollywood blockbuster = a total mess The problem with the story is that the movie sets up the stage and introduces the Eternals to the audience, but ultimately no one would bother to care because much has been shown yet we know so little. All the Eternals are portrayed to be complex and have their troubles, concerns, and values. Plus, you have their boss, their archnemesis/mission, and a looming Armageddon. Yet from what is shown, all we know is that the world is complex, and that's basically it.The universe as a whole is under-developed. Being desperate to showcase all characters, the movie goes so far as to jump repeatedly back and forth on the timeline and across different places, while the audience barely understands their interactions, let alone be emotionally attached to them. With as many as 4 relationships that are, to say the least, mildly intimate going on within the 10 Eternals members and one of them being a love quad-triangle relationship, Chloe and Feige just couldn't find a way to show so much.The problem intensifies when approaching the 3rd act of the movie. The movie invested screentime talking about what the characters were doing after they split up, yet everything crumbles after eternals assemble. What are their personalities? What made them live the life they chose? And most importantly, what happened in their own private lives that shaped their decisions of whether or not to stand with the beings on planet Earth after they acknowledged the significance of their existence? What did they experience that re-shaped their views of their creators and enemies? Instead of diving deeper into a select handful of characters, movie chooses to instead go through all of them in a flashback-athon, and merely presents the fact that they simply made their decision as to take which side. How is the audience going to reciprocate their sentiment if we don't even know the rationale behind their actions?All of the characters have unique and interesting stories that are worth going in-depth, but the execution makes the Eternals family look as crippled and fragmented as the plot is shattered. The final product is a futile and incoherent attempt of a story crammed with information that is as forgettable as a blink in eternity, and even spectacular scenery couldn't save the movie from being a mess."
3278,10,"AMAZING! I don't really know what many of these people are talking about. This movie was one of my favorite MCU films to date! Amazing characters, great story and extremely moving."
3279,1,"Worst Marvel Movie Yet They just keep getting worse in my opinion. This one is a mess, it's all over the place and there is no character development. You don't really care who lives or dies in this movie. They could have killed them all off and it wouldn't have made a difference."
3280,9,"Super beautiful movie Deep meta levels of understanding and viewing each situation and character. Absolutely enjoyed it. The score was amazing, the pictures absolutely beautiful and the story was a very philosophical question if humans deserve to live."
3281,6,"Diet Coke Zack Snyder I hate to say it but critics were right. Eternals isn´t like the comics (who cares) and not the worst MCU film but still towards the bottom. Basically Dune 2021 x what critics accuse MoS of being. Cut 25 minutes, loose the random remnants of MCU ""humor"" and the forced exposition, give the cast and Deviants more intriguing looks, give the Deviants more scenes where they aren´t CGI rage monsters and there would have been something here. Neil Gainman failed to give this IP a hook in the 00s and the same goes for its creator Jack Kirby in the 80s so I´ll continue waiting for a New Gods show or movie. Especially if Zack Snyder´s take is used who has a similar approach to Chloé Zhao when it comes to Supergods. Zhao pulls her punches though, unlike him. Snyder´s controversial vision found a mass audience in the end. I can´t see that here and the Disney producers are already doing damage control in the press.The Eternals is almost a good movie. Almost. I can see a semi-sequel working so don´t fully pull the plug yet Feige as this isn´t a second Inhumans."
3282,9,"Excellent superhero movie and much better than I thought Superhero movies are so many now and they seem to pop up almost every month so I think most of us are getting jaded. However once in a while a real gem show us why we still love the genre and Eternals is one of those.This is so surprisingly great that I gave it a 9/10 which is the highest I given anything superhero-y in a very, very long time.Acting is fantastic, directing great, music score amazing, set pieces and sets lovely. The movie is cinematography porn mixed with great characters, brilliant writing and superb entertainment.Two things bothered me. First of many of the little quips or ""jokes"" is very out of place. This is a great masterful movie with space Gods, galaxies and amazing technology, and it is also a bit dark and grittier than you might think so those ""jokes"" seldom land very well. This is definitely a Marvel-sickness they need to get rid off, way too much of that in this movie. The second thing is that the movie is too short. I know most people will claim otherwise, and most reviewers will say it is too long or have slow pacing, but I completely disagree. This is so amazingly done that I want 2 hours more, plus there are a lot of characters and we need to get to know them better.There are two end credit scenes, both are a bit too comic-y so if you do not know who these characters are or know the lore you might miss a few things.This is one of the best superhero movies Marvel has done, I would put it just below the two or three top movies. I had very low expectations though so that might have helped my score and surprise enjoyment, but this is very well done. 9/10 and I highly recommend."
3283,9,"Stunning visuals and thought provoking storyline Chloe Zhao really knew how to create stunning, expansive visuals that draws the viewers to the story.I was enthralled by the sets, definitely and the CGI added, not distracted the viewers from the story.The story itself is rather thought provoking and for certain it wasn't the Endgame type of epic all out showdown one should expect. Nonetheless, it was a satisfying ending that opens the MCU to more stories and more characters in future."
3284,9,"Beautiful Movie - Must see Beautiful movie full of lore and origin for the first Eternals movie. Coupled with equality and taking us to a part of the marvel comics i was not to familiar with, I loved this movie. I came away from this feeling like I knew who everyone was, which I did not expect was possible for such a big cast in this genre. The exposition was the subtlest I've seen from Marvel, and the overall plot was complex enough to still be very clear. For once I didn't have to Google anything afterwards (except for the mid & post credits stuff)."
3285,10,Increible...✨ This is a film that needs a real audience to correct the words of purity. The director did her best to create the most important characters that did not see the light: The Eternals.
3286,1,This time miss fire First the movie is totally a big mess definitely they tried some thing different this time but the movie is too long it has it moments but they test our patience i dont like it i expected a lot from this marvel movie but it never looked a marvel movie better to stay away from this movie.
3287,7,"Up, down and rockets The plot at the beginning is quite interesting because of the action. However, at the middle of the plot, the storyline is quite slow. But, when it comes to the final part, the movie rocket to the top. I cannot wait to watch the second part."
3288,10,"Loved every second of it! ...and it's a lot of seconds, since this movie is 152 minutes long. Which, admittedly, is a lot and sometimes it gets a bit slow, but there was literally no other way to introduce these characters. It would have always needed a lot of explanation to introduce the Eternals, but Chloé Zhao somehow managed to make it a good package overall. Just one hour into the film it felt like we've had these characters for years, all of them with their own personalities, quirks, wants and needs.With an emotional twist that - apparently- no one really saw coming, this movie quickly went up my personal list of favorite marvel movies."
3289,10,Really a great movie! I don't understand the bad reviews because the movie is a great work of art and actor work!! The movie gives a really great representation of people of color and also people of lgbtiq+. Which include more in movies and now a days!!
3290,10,Wonderful Wow this movie is superb. And I love this movie as well as i like all Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. So many characters I love. Iam waiting for Spider man No Way Home. It's gonna be epic. And I love eternals too. Don't care about bad reviews. My english was too bad i know.
3291,6,"Amazing visuals, mediocre editing, confusing story While I wouldn't say that Eternals deserves to be the lowest rated MCU movie (My personal pick for worst MCU film is Thor The Dark World), there are glaring issues with the plot, editing and pacing of the film that should have been addressed.Eternals is about Eternals, a race of immortal superheroes with various powers who are put on Earth to fight off Deviants, a type of generic monster. Their powers come from the Celestials, godlike creatures that create stars and galaxies from scratch, who instructed the Eternals to help the humans fight off Deviants, but otherwise not interfere with human politics and war.A very clever little way of dodging the obvious questions of ""Why didn't they help the Avengers fight Thanos?"", but not clever enough to answer other questions like ""Where are the other numerous superheroes of the MCU during the events of this film?""I had the same problem with Shang Chi, but Shang Chi had the benefit of having a much more small scale and personal story, but Eternals is by design a massive story to tell in just one movie, and I don't think it quite delivers.I will give some compliments. Visually the film is stunning, the director Chloe Zhao, recently receiving several awards for her previous film Nomadland, shows off her talent for cinematography. Both the visual effects and nature photography are standouts, making this a high contender for best looking MCU movie, among the likes of Ragnarok and Doctor Strange. The characters and performances are overall great, some better than others. I loved the main character Sersi, her powers were cool and I found her very likeable. Eternals also deserves praise for having the first gay kiss in an MCU movie, although still made in such a way that they can cut it out of the film for certain audiences. The powers of the characters are overall pretty great and unique in terms of the MCU.Overall I think this film was fun but flawed. It does deserve criticism, and the editing was pretty bad at parts, but it doesn't deserve to be the lowest rated MCU movie. I hope that the MCU producers learn from their mistakes in this film and improve for upcoming projects with these characters."
3292,10,"Eternals takes the MCU to a whole new level with all its greatness and preciousness From the intro with the scrolling words, reminiscent of an epic classic, to the last post-credits scene, Eternals takes us on a journey through the history of planet Earth, in the vision of ten powerful beings who have come to help mankind evolve. Everything in this film is well crafted, with great sensibility and dedication from Oscar winner director Chloé Zhao. All the characters, from Kingo's human butler to the celestial overlord Arishem, are magnificently and deeply developed, and we can clearly understand the pains of these people. And of course, how can we not talk about the cinematography and visuals of this film? Zhao didn't mess around here, she brought the most stunningly beautiful film in the entire MCU. I would like to point out how the inclusion in this film is the most truthful and well-executed of the genre. All in all, even with the few flaws in the film, Chloé Zhao has brought the most heartwarming, honest, different and greatest film from the studio. Honestly, this is what I would like to keep watching in the MCU, more intense and insightful films with different viewpoints. There is a certain strangeness to it but a necessary change. It's time to embrace the new in this universe. Eternals is clearly the turning point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and we are definitely moving towards a more diverse, different, and certainly very wonderful MCU."
3293,9,"Not saying it's flawless... But it's about time to make some changes to the MCU... The way the director chose to make it is what the MCU's needing to do currently - to make the movie go deeper than common people thought. There are many details to be revealed and, in spite of several scenes seem to be a little bit redundant, the movie itself runs harmonicly and goes smoothly as it should be exactly as is."
3294,9,"Ignore the bad reviews, see the movie for yourself and make your opinion Just came from the movie tonight and I loved it. The characters and writing was superb and was wonderfullt emotional and intimate. It didn't feel like an MCU movie and guess what... THATS A GOOD THING! They're trying something new and that's what we want. The movie is quite long but the length is needed for introducing 10 new unique characters with their own motivations and also the story of the celestials. The action is great and intense, the story feels dark and more mature then we are used to, the acting is phenomenal and overall was a solid film not just a solid MCU film. Ignore the bad reviews and watch it yourself and make an opinion, it won't be a movie for all viewers but it is definitely not a bad film!"
3295,9,"Underestimated I like it since the beginning of the story. It's been cool to see eternals through the ages, but the past-to-present contrast isn't that smooth. The characters are cool and their powers are awesome, but it's frustrating in some scenes. But overall, it's actually a good movie, so it shouldn't be underestimated like that, the scale is big, it's epic, the visual work is very beautiful, very spectacular, want to see it again to enjoy the visual work."
3296,6,"I'm too old for this Watching Eternals made me realize, man.. I'm too old for this. I think it's time for me to grow out of MCU. It's done. Feels too fantasy for me instead of action. Don't like the direction of cgi monster fighting, it's like fighting the boring ultron. Trying to unite all to fight an external alien. No depth. Yuck. I actually hated the monster part in Shang chi too. Wenwu's multi layered character made me a fan. Disney is really good at turning fun into a boring unmemorable overused lazy pile of dirt made with gold. High budget, same stale cake. The movie is ok, just too many characters, and none of them shine, except Ikaris (evil superman vibe). I like the gay couple. I just don't like the story telling. When i want to watch a disney cartoon fairy tale, I'd watch one. But when I watch an superhero film, I want to watch a superhero film, not a disney hero for kids film. Going to watch dr. Strange and Spidey. After that quit for good. Goodbye MCU."
3297,10,THE Eternals blew my mind This movie blew my mind I kept thinking that all the bad reviews were true but there's no way this movie is amazing. The plot is well crafted and well developed characters bring us a new style of Superhero movie which breaks the stale reputation show the formula that the MC you was using.
3298,10,Great new concept for MCU Loved every second of it. Great story and great action!!! Felt like a whole new take on the marvel franchise. Kids loved it and I loved it. I can't wait for more in this series.
3299,9,"Beautiful opening for Phase 4 The movie is definitely different from other MCU films, due to less action sequences and a lot more story building and cinematography (landscaping was amazing). I don't really mind that because it is necessary to introduce us to a lot of new characters and further movies.What I find refreshing is the diversity. The eternals are supposed to save the entire world, not just the USA so it makes sense that it represents the population of our entire planet, not just that of Northern America and (Western) Europe."
3300,1,"Another mess of a movie Nothing memorable to make us want to see them again. Beautiful cinematography and not so good story. Character arc is close to zero. They do nothing new and original, it's Marvel's copy - paste again."
3301,10,"Realistic ""The Avengers"" movie I am gonna give a honest review here.Marvel wanted to get close to the reality about the humans and their emotions in this movie.Positives: * Fights * Kingo and Karun comedy * CGI * Character development * Engaging plot * Few unexpected twists * ThenaNegatives: * Climax was bit of dissapointment. But can't think of better way to end it.*Overall, you can't go wrong if you want to spend 2.5 hours to watch a masterpiece like this. DO NOT trust other reviews, their expectations were incorrect to begin with."
3302,6,"Not bad, just a bit strained 'Eternals' is both a Marvel superhero film, but also not - unlike some other MCU films having lesser-known superheroes, this is almost a parallel universe, or a 'What If?' episode, with 10 new Eternals (good immortal aliens) introduced to us in 5,000BC that help save humans from Deviants (bad aliens), sent by Celestials (big aliens). The film spends most of it's time in 2021, but has plenty of flashbacks over the previous millennia.As they're not mainstream heroes, they all seem to have a generic power, with no-one being too special. As with all ensemble casts, not everyone gets much screen-time and it takes a while to figure out who does what and how they fit in. For the record, Ajak (Hayek) is the leader, with Sersi (Chan; the heart of the film) and Ikaris (Madden) essentially acting as the leads/love interests. The next most screen-time goes to Sprite (McHugh, the ""kid"") and Kingo (Nanjiani, a little comedic relief). Then there's Thena (Jolie, barely used), Phastos (Tyree Henry), Makkari (Ridloff), Druig (Keoghan, such a punchable face) and Gilgamesh (Dong-seok). Once you figure out who's who, it's basically over!There's not really a ""big bad guy"" as such, and the whole Celestials thing is pretty laughable, but if you go with it, there's still quite a bit that doesn't really come together until the end. The final 30min or so is pretty exciting, but there's certainly a sizeable lull in the middle. It certainly has it's moments, with some good CGI, but the stakes never seem quite as high as they should and the tone is often a bit too dour, with not as much fun and effervescence as I'd expect. The post-credits scenes create more questions for the next set of films to answer."
3303,7,Nice but a little to long Really great looking movie with a lot of really good looking shoots bit that was expected from the director. Tje cast is also really good with some really nice performances on the other side some characters have almost no chance to shine. The movie has at some times a really nice flow that gets interrupted by scenes that bring the pacing down and it feels because of them at least 30 minutes to long. I had a good time and it evolves the marvel universe in a interesting direction.
3304,10,"Fantastic movie! I love the effects and storyline, it's something you've never seen before, really good movie. Ignore the bad reviews, see it for yourself. Their powers look really pretty and the different variety of casts in the movie is fitted perfectly with the roles!"
3305,8,"Eternal love... Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest. I personally was holding out hope that this would finally be an MCU film with a group of characters from space who I actually liked and weren't a bunch of a-holes. An opening crawl not only explains who Eternals are, but Deviants and Celestials too. There's enough exposition through dialogue to answer any questions one might have whilst watching (such as why these Eternals were 'Switzerland' during the battle against Thanos). Complaints about this film being 'confusing' because it alternates between past and present must be from those with short attention spans, as it's quite obvious what time period the movie's in at any given time thanks to helpful location title cards. Too many characters? I think not. Endgame had 30-something characters and nobody complained. Each of these Eternals has a distinct personality.Salma Hayek gives good wise leader as Ajak, who can heal, but her decision-making causes some conflict with the others. Gemma Chan (who I became a fan of thanks to her nuanced performance in the TV series Humans) has a certain quality about her that makes her the perfect fit for Sersi, whose power is molecular manipulation. She experiences self-doubt, but there's more to her than she thinks. Long ago she was involved with Richard Madden's character, Ikaris, who's kind of like Superman (one unexpected thing in this movie is the shout-outs to the MCU 'rivals', DC, with the Superman/Batman mentions) with the flying/eyebeams/super-strength. Over the course of the movie we find out why he left Sersi, and like her character, he's got more going on than you might expect. Madden's a natural fit as the 'leading man' type and he really brings it when it comes to conveying the conflicted emotions his character feels.Kit Harington plays Dane Whitman, who's someone Sersi could be happy with until Ikaris' return throws a spanner in the works. Those wishing to see the two GoT actors reunited onscreen should be happy with the scene where their characters size each other up, but thankfully it never descends into teen drama love triangle angst. After watching the trailers, the one character I wasn't sure I'd be fond of was the young-in-appearance redheaded girl, Sprite, whose power is creating illusions. Whilst she isn't *too* bad for the majority of the movie, she did annoy me towards the end and I was peeved she didn't face suitable consequences for her actions, instead seemingly being *rewarded* with something she'd always wanted (her crush on older-looking men/willingness to follow them no matter what makes her seem quite shallow). Turns out my first instincts/gut reaction to her was correct. She's a brat.They soon seek out the other Eternals because a cataclysmic event called 'the Emergence' (involving a Celestial, that's big enough to dwarf a planet, hatching from the planet Earth...which is bad news for humanity) is imminent. They first find Kingo (whose power is shooting beams similar to Ikaris' eyebeams...except from his hands) filming Bollywood movies. He provides a bit of light relief from the doom/gloom, but it's his valet, Karun, who steals their scenes. Gilgamesh (who punches really hard) and Thena (who kicks major ar$e) next rejoin the group, and there was a nice dynamic between them. Angelina Jolie may surprise some with how much emotion she brings to the role of Thena. She has something happen to her which proves a problem for everyone, but Gilgamesh stands by her, making for a good character relationship. Characters who arrive later include Druig (a mind-controller), Makkari (a speedster) and Phastos (an inventor). Each serves a purpose in the story and the actors do the most with what they're given.It was nice to have a memorable/epic theme tune in an MCU movie again and the film's score is quite beautiful, as is the cinematography. There are breathtaking shots throughout, the fights feel visceral, the CGI is as convincing as one can hope for in creating such otherworldly things (those Celestials are quite the sight to behold) and I don't get complaints about the Eternals' costumes (as I, for one, welcome anything that isn't Thor: Ragnarok-esque/looking like it could be purchased at a discount costume shop). I saw people ragging on the 'basic'/'cheap'-looking Eternals spaceship, but I appreciate the simplicity of their ship wedge. Sci-fi movies seem to want to keep creating more and more outlandish-looking ships and eventually it'll reach the point where they become SO bizarre-looking you'll wonder, ""WTF kind of functionality does that have?"". There are mid-credits/post-credits scenes to hang around for; the former introducing what seems like a rather important character (whose casting may surprise some) while the latter promises more to come for a certain character/actor who felt a bit underutilized in this film.I'm annoyed at the fact people have been badmouthing this film (some giving it 1/10 star ratings without even having *seen* it). Yes, the movie's 'different', but that's not a BAD thing. Some had complained about the MCU being 'formulaic', yet when it tries something new/different, they complain about that too. I LIKE the fact that this movie offered something we hadn't seen before. It was refreshing. Quite a few of the MCU films have been popular with the 'majority' whilst I personally haven't liked them, then there have been a few ones that haven't been that popular that I've actually liked. So, this criticism Eternals is receiving means very little to me. Also, you have to factor in that this movie features some things that will make a certain group of individuals biased against it/rate it far lower than it deserves. I honestly don't know why anyone puts so much faith in one website and its ratings to determine whether a movie is 'successful' or not, when really what EVERYONE should be doing is seeing it for themselves before they judge instead of bandwagon-jumping. I, for one, hope we get to see more of these Eternals and that the negative reviews/haters don't rob us of that."
3306,10,Different in a good way One thing this movie did extremly well was its diversity it all the characters that weren't typical even if they were had a diverse aspect to them they didnt rely heavily on sign language for the deaf character. The homosexual character was really well done. And even down to things like mental health was done well and authentic. We even had a good plot twist that wasn't seen coming until it did. Couldn't be happier with how it turned out and the end credit scenes were even better. Tried to keep it as spoiler free as possible. 😁
3307,5,"This movie was overall a forgettable mess but pretty fun. So first off we get introduced to the internals, which has Sersi (Gemma Chan), the guy who acted in Game of thrones and blonde celebrity woman. It has quite interesting start but why would but the eternals past memories plucked in the middle of the movie? It just doesn't fit into the film at all. And the characters also felt as forgettable as the story, most of them feel like they are artificial robots. And I actually felt happy that The guy commuted sucked just to easily forget him.But... What I like about it is the visuals and costume design, as well as the humour. It still has same aura as the other marvel movies and never lets go of it."
3308,7,"It isn't the best but it definitely isn't the worst I understand most of the negative complaints about the movie but it was also refreshing to see a movie like this.First of all, the movie was absolutely beautiful. The music is also really great.I love the characters. They all have their own thing and have their own personality. Makkari is definitely my favourite. I am sad what they did with 2 of the characters. I understand it was for the plot but it's just a shame. But maybe that they can change that in the next movie considering what we found out about them.Kit Harrington was a bit wasted in this film but we all know that he'll get a bigger role in another movie so I'll let that one pass.The villian also could've been better. They didn't feel like a threat and it was quickly over with them. With the other villian (if you can call them that, I'm not sure) it didn't feel like a threat until the last scene. I'm also conflicted if I like it what they did with a character to help the villian.The plot itself was alright. They had to explain a lot but sometimes they gave too much information at once which made it confusing and a bit boring. But the overall plot was just fine and just like every other MCU movie.First post credit scene was good. I'm curious what they'll do with that. I did laugh when the characther appeared because I'm just not sure about the actor. The second one was disappointing. We all knew that it was going to happen but it's still nothing. They also stopped at the most interesting moment.Overall, the movie has indeed it's downsides but it also has it's good moments. I'll definitely rewatch it the second it's released on Disney+. Just watch it and decide for yourself if this is a movie you'll like or not. In the end it's still a MCU movie and really not that bad as some people make it out to be. I enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to see more of the Eternals."
3309,9,"Yet another amazing new Marvel movie!! Finally saw Eternals yesterday, going in with mixed feelings.The trailer looked quite interesting, though I heard the critic reviews were quite bad.But man was I pleasantly surprised. This movie is truly incredible.Loved the history, the story, the STUNNING visuals and amazing cast. Very cool to see the diverse cast. Makes it so much more real.Can not wait for this amazing story to get continued!"
3310,9,Psyched for this new MCU Phase This movie sets up great characters for this new phase in the MCU. I would compare this movie to Thor or another Marvel movie that establishes a character(s)
3311,8,"Not the mcu's best, but far from its worst. Eternals is not the best MCU movie, not even close. But the general consensus for reviews on many aggregate websites are painfully misrepresent how good this film is. The special effects are exceptional, and Zhao's decision to film on-location gives the film a layer of authenticity that isn't found in a lot of Marvel films. The acting is very good, particularly Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. The cast has great chemistry, and is much more diverse than what is typical even now in the film industry, which I don't doubt is a factor in the film's surprisingly low ratings. The depiction a deaf character is well handled, as is Marvel's first on-screen queer relationship.That's not to say that there aren't significant issues with Eternals. Its very long, the second-longest Marvel film, behind Endgame, and the pacing does drag in places.Additionally, Eternals deals with a lot of comic book lore which can't really be left out of the film considering that most people watching this film won't have read the comic books. Eternals tends to dump a lot of lore in conversations which often feel rather forced, and for me, the way that the exposition was handles was by far my least favourite part about Eternals.Eternals is still worth a watch. It feels a lot less like any MCU film i've seen, which is interesting in itself, even if it's not what you look for in your entertainment. I might even say that at times it feels more like a DC film than anything Marvel has produced before.If you are, as I was, quite aware of the ways that Eternals falls short as a piece of cinema, it's still entertaining, visually stunning, and at times very moving, and it sets up some interesting concepts for the future of the MCU. Frankly, the fact that it's currently lower-rated than both the incredible hulk and Thor: The Dark World is ridiculous. It's orders of magnitude better than both those films, so don't let the mediocre rating dissuade you from giving Eternals a shot.Even if it's not the best film i've ever seen, it's still solid entertainment."
3312,8,"I like it... Its different and i like it Idk why people try to compare this movie with The Suicide Squad.. huh???And why most of you act like Marvel never make a DC reference?Don't you remember Spider-Man with Toby???When he try for for the first time shooting the web.. ""Up up and a way""??? ""Shazam""???And you gave this movie bad review because of that???OMG!!!I'll give this movie 7.5 just because like many people with brains said here... its a little bit messy. I like the cast and Brian Tyree Henry is my favorite. Perfect timing...."
3313,10,"A Very Different Marvel Movie that Defies Expectations After having watched all Marvel movies religiously from Iron Man 2008 to Shangchi. This finally brings a breath of fresh air. At times, it even reminds me a little of the Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan. Of course they are very different movies, but both felt like a mature and thoughtful adventure that has ambition of being more than just a simple superhero recipe.Admittedly there are problems with pacing and character building. Thena being a particularly weak one for me, which may have been caused by my heightened expectations of Angelina Jolie's superhero debut.Right now, I think Marvel needs movies like this to move forward. Honestly, after the ultimate climax of End Game, can they really keep going with the old universe and same old formula? It has already started to get boring and way too bland. I didn't particularly enjoy Shangchi for this very reason. It was too familiar with only a thin layer of Asian skin and 'culture'.Overall, I think Eternals deserves to be seen and to be continued. It is only the first experiment. Hopefully future projects of similar scale and style will become more refined, and thus truly redefine the superhero genre."
3314,8,"Avengers version of Eternals When I heard the Eternals were to be the next Marvel project, I was hoping for a mature television series with both serial end point and regular seasonal story arch. Exploring their influences from ape cousins through to consequences of eternals cross-breeding and in-fighting etc However, we have a movie which has been develop to fit into the Avengers phase plans. In this version, the Eternals arrived in the middle-east only 7000BC with an operative task, while acting as guardian observers, cause conflicting interpretations in the team. We are presented with a movie with a big ask to deliver lot of information in a limited amount of time. Unfortunately the dialogue becomes rushed, and for some who prefer action, some patience will be required between scenes. Character development is brilliant, even with some secondary and tertiary characters who may return in future instalments. It is an origin movie with the foe added into the story."
3315,10,"I knew I would love this movie From the second I stepped into the theatres to watch this movie I felt excited. The visuals for this movie are stunning. The costumes, the landscapes, the scale, the actors themselves - all stunning. What this movie does well, is introduces a new set of characters and makes you attached to them so by the end of the movie you are left biting your nails, as I was.It was such a refreshing movie and felt adventurous, unlike anything Marvel related. A new set of characters and cast, with plenty of plots and storylines to focus on going forward. What's not to love?"
3316,9,"Amazing This is an amazing movie! I enjoyed it from start to finish. I didn't quite understand why he has such bad reviews. Visually this film is beautiful. The characters have their own conflicts and stories, which are interesting to follow. I think this movie is worth seeing."
3317,7,"The boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far ""Eternals"" is the third film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Chloe Zhao (""Nomadland""), it is the boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far.For over 7,000 years, the immortal aliens known as the ""Eternals"" have lived secretly among the human race in various places on Earth, watching as they have advanced throughout the course of history. A short time after half of all life was restored during the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", the Eternals each discover that an apocalyptic event known as the ""Emergence"" has begun, causing their ancient foes ""The Deviants"" to reawaken and attack the human population. With the very existence of humanity resting on their shoulders, the Eternals must now collectively reunite to prevent the destruction of everything they have all witnessed come into being.Considering how many years it's been around, the MCU hasn't pushed too many boundaries with the formula it has created. Almost all of them follow a typical template - introduce the hero, establish their significance, have them acquire their powers, make them fight and defeat the villain(s), and tease at their inclusion in future movies. Rinse and repeat. You could argue that there's no point in fixing what isn't broken but at the same time I've always wanted to see them try something new to shake things up a bit. ""Eternals"" happens to take a number of risks with its approach to origin stories and while not all of them succeeded, the ones that did show that there is hope this long running series won't stagnate creatively anytime soon.Rather than the usual everyman or everywoman who gain their superpowers later on, here the titular Eternals are actually omnipotent figures that have always had access to their godlike abilities. As a result, the film doesn't spend any time showing how they all reached their full potential, instead expecting us to accept their unique qualities right away. But this doesn't mean the characters aren't relatable at all, as they still experience the same type of problems as regular humans. In spite of their status as ageless beings, each of them display modern humanlike traits from time to time.For example, the character Sersi has an addiction to her smartphone, enamoured by the convenience of being able to take photos instantly. This is a believable attribute that an individual who looks as youthful as her would have in today's world, which adds some necessary depth to someone who has been alive for thousands of years. Little quirks like this remind the audience that it is possible to feel a connection to these characters without feeling too alienated by their otherworldly origins, and moments like that help distinguish the MCU from the early films of the DC Extended Universe.Coming hot of the tails of winning the Best Director Oscar for ""Nomadland"", Chloe Zhao here delivers a film that could be considered the complete opposite. Whereas ""Nomadland"" was a humble down-to-earth story about people surviving with what they had out on the road, ""Eternals"" instead takes the audience on a different type of journey - an effects-laden exploration of the mythology of heroes. Zhao likens each of the Eternals' interactions with humans to that of the ancient Greek and Roman gods with the impact they've left on mankind's progress throughout history, both positive and negative. Such examples include inventing ploughshares for farmers and later the atomic bomb to bring about the end of a major war. While I do appreciate this vastly different approach to what we're normally used to, the major problem here is that the film focuses too much on fleshing out each member of the Eternals.Since the film has an ensemble cast of more than ten lead characters instead of just one, most of the resulting runtime is unfortunately stuffed with bloated exposition about their overall relevance to the story. I understand the importance of developing each of the characters' individual personalities, but so much time is spent doing this that it causes the second act to drag on way longer than it should. Anyone who is expecting frequent action throughout will be disappointed as most of the best parts occur near the conclusion. Granted, there is a decent amount of emotional weight during this climactic finale, so it was partially worth sitting through the whole thing in the end.Out of all the Eternals, the only one that comes close to being the main protagonist would be Sersi (Gemma Chan), who has the ability to shapeshift any type of matter around her. She is easily the most likeable of the main cast, as she is the emotional glue that holds them all together. As for the rest, I also liked Richard Madden as Ikaris, who can fly and shoot laser beams out of his eyes, and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, a Bollywood star who can fire energy beams out of his hands. To comment on every other member of the Eternals would take too much time so these three are the only ones I am going to single out here. Although his role is only a minor one, Kit Harrington's character Dane Whitman was amusing as the absent-minded boyfriend of Sersi. It's interesting to see two significant ""Game of Thrones"" actors like Madden and Harrington in the same film together, added by the fact that they each know someone homophonically named Sersi/Cersei.Though ""Eternals"" didn't achieve everything it was setting out to accomplish, it was still bold enough to deviate from the monotonous formula it has had set in stone over the past thirteen years. Naturally there will be many people who will hate this film for doing just that, and that is completely understandable, but personally I admire that it took risks instead of playing it safe as per usual. I don't think every other MCU film should follow suit as this may result in alienating too many hardcore fans, but hopefully this one will leave just enough of an impression to show that the series is capable of trying new things.I rate it 7/10."
3318,9,"For me this is beginning of the Real Phase 4 movie. Its overwhelming ,Beginning to the Ending. You will get sucked in the story right away.I saw critics score on RT but trust me this one will mot fail your expectations. One thing you should know it tells about the History to the present day of MCU, so its not easy to put all of it together in a single movie . Eternals have the potential of a Two part movie like IW & EG. I Appreciate this beauty of the color grading they went with.Go with Heart You will Enjoy it and Love it."
3319,10,"Speechless No words can describe what I saw yesterday. Just a phenomenal film without big flaws. The directing of the flim is sublime. The dynamics between the characters are excellent. Perfect in many points. Don't listen to the critics, they are all wrong."
3320,8,"It's better than people want it to be. Took my family last night, wife, and two girls, ages 14 and 11. The 11 year old is always fidgety during movies and sat still for 2.5 hours. She loved it. I had some trepidation after seeing so many reviews that seemed to suggest this was a miss for Marvel. All I can say is, I think it's unique, deep, and incredibly satisfying. It opens new doors and new stories for the MCU, and I cannot wait to see what happens next. If you love MCU movies and you're not homophobic, you will probably enjoy Eternals. Last thought: it is a bit too long. It has some pacing issues, but beyond that just go see it for yourself. Make up your own mind."
3321,10,Visually stunning with engaging storyline Not sure about the bad reviews here and from the bloody critics but i absolutely loved it! 2.5 hours just went passed like a breeze. There was no yawning moments and it was engaging throughout with the anticipation of the next scene stacking seamlessly.
3322,9,"Eternals will outlive all negativity. I have read that this film has no humour, but I and the cinema audience all laughed out load at every joke. I have read this film is lifeless, but every frame is a celebration of the history, versatility, and complexity of life. I found every character compelling, and loved the family(ish) dynamic being challenged by 7000 years together."
3323,9,"Very impressed !! I really liked this movie ! A golden cast, an amazing director and an incredible soundtrack!I was blown away by the storyline of the characters and their fights (psychological ones and physical ones) Very different and very unique. One of the best movie of the year so far.And the post credit scenes are very powerful!Well done !!"
3324,8,"Great story I found it very original as a Marvel movie. I have to say that it's very different from any other MCU movie, but I loved that it went deep with topics that sometimes in this universe are dealt in a more ""shallow"" way. From the visual apparatus I have nothing to say; It's one of the most stunning movie of Marvel. It's just a movie that takes its time to unfold, so if you're looking for some fresh air in Marvel, this movie may be suitable for you.P.s. The chemistry between the characters is very well structured (helped by the amazing acting skills of the cast).P. P. S. Sorry for any typos or mistakes but english is not my mother tongue."
3325,9,"Very impressed !!! I really liked this movie, an amazing cast, an incredible director and a beautiful soundtrack. Very different, very unique. I was really blown away by the fights (physical ones but also the psychologically ones) Their problematics were deeply more complicated or more intense (trying not to spoil anything lol) And the humor was very present and very well brought.What an experience !!(Sorry for my mistakes I'm French)"
3326,8,"A great addition to the Marvel Universe This is a really good movie. It's about 24hrs since I've seen it and I can't stop thinking about it. Without giving anything away this film does take on a lot and maybe would've benefited from being less. An edit of characters, plot twists and CGI may have taken a good film to a truly great film.But I enjoyed it. It was a visual feast in a movie that needed to please MCUers while attempting to reach for something more. And yet I think it did succeed in that - it is thought provoking while being a very entertaining flick.Is it the best Marvel movie ever, no. Does it have it's flaws, yes. Should that stop you from seeing it and enjoying it, no. Not in the least.I'm very much looking forward to E2 and where these characters go next."
3327,8,Stunning visuals and sounds but little lacks in story and plitt Don't mind the critics if you're a marvel fan go watch it immediately and if you're a normal fan still you'll enjoy the film because its different from other mcu films.
3328,7,Don't follow the minds of negative criticism This movie is absolutely beautiful. Different in a good way narrated the movie well and screenplay direction of characters and how they play the purpose of eternal what is the celestials exist for and how the eternals get together to fight for that purpose it's not all time action scenes but developing and making you understand the good and bad the path you choose of your free will it's good movie and fresh from other Marvel movies it's a new beginning.
3329,9,"This is really good, although may not be for everyone So I have a lot to say.It's beautiful and I'm sure most will like it. I think the pace was fine, the story starts quickly without too much introduction. At no point it felt slow or boring to me, there are no notable filler scenes and everything is there for something or for the characters' development, there is always something new to discover, a surprise or a twist. I actually wanted to go to the bathroom when it started and went until the very end because I was so hooked on the plot lol. Wasn't expecting it but it has a lot of action, although it works really well with the story and doesn't feel unnecessary.It definitely falls outside the Marvel formula, it has a different and much more mature tone without childish jokes, although it's still funny and made me laugh (and my theater) several times. It's normal to forget that you are watching an MCU movie, it happened to me most part of the movie. It may not be to everyone's taste but at least for me and my friends who watched it was pretty good.It's a thought provoking movie, it doesn't tell you what is right or who the villain is, it's up to you from the perspective you want to take. Still considered the story is very clear and not confusing. I think what stands out the most is characters' development, they all are interesting and relatable, they have flaws.I also didn't pay much attention to it because I was hooked on the story but it's visually stunning. The cast is perfect and they are very talented, every scene looks natural, and without question Chloe Zhao's direction is great. I really want to watch the film again.I feel like it lacked something, maybe it's because I had very high expectations but I'd give it 9/10."
3330,1,"Bad Idealistic in making something can be a good thing and it can also be a bad thing.marvel's idealism in this case is contrary to the majority of normal people in the world so that what we get is a bad result, we can't just ignore what Marvel wants to give in this film This will lead to future Marvel films or others who will openly show bad behavior, Hollywood films have now become a political realm, letting things like Marvel do in Eternals will make those who have an interest win."
3331,8,"Ignore the bad reviews... If you like Marvel films then you will like this film. It looks fantastic, the characters are interesting and portrayed well. The film has a good story line and I was entertained throughout."
3332,3,"Breaking the mold for mavel movies, and my patience. This movie, as all Marvel movies, is extremely beautiful and the well thought out. The character designs (non human), are really breathtaking! So is the VFX. But that's everything nice i have to say about it.The story itself feels forced, like grasping for straws. I was hoping for a more down to earth marvel movie, an origin story of sorts. But once again our heroes are somehow saving the universe, in a world where its citizens probably shouldn't make any long term investments, since the world seems to be in danger every 2 years.If you've watched any other avengers movie, stay home. This is one to watch on whatever streaming service you fancy."
3333,8,"Something unique This movies is something you quite dont except to see as in a good way, but also in a strange way.First of all, i want to say, it's not THAT bad, as you can read from everywhere, it just somethig different, trying to be a huge marvel blokbuster with heart inside.I will try to deconstruct the main moments.Story: it's long, very long, it focuses mostly on relationships (which is good, if you a keen to see long-movies without much of the action), but if you dont? Well, then probably the story will fell for you in the 50% of the movie time.Characters: i rarely remember every heroes name, but this time i do, everyone has face in this picture, they are no good or bad heroes, but the grey ones. They are tons of humour, and conflicts.Camera works: long-expositions as if you watching Chloé's or Terrence Malick's recent works, you will see a lot of similarities.Effects / Fights: they are great, not perfect, but very fast paced, and brutal, even though i really wanted more.Overal this movie is very uniqute, it has elements of indie movies combined with marvel's standart formula, with great characters, a very interesting questions, but long-expositions, and huge amount of small details can be a burden to fully enjoy the story."
3334,10,"It tosses the typical MCU template and takes us in a new direction. I was so excited when they announced Eternals two years ago because I wanted a movie that changed their genre, and they did it. Thank you, Chloé Zhao, and Marvel Studios, for bringing us this masterpiece.It was fantastic! The film thinks outside the box by focusing on the characters' relationships rather than solely on action-packed set pieces and superfluous comedy. Eternals is undoubtedly one of my favorite MCU entries, beautifully directed, photographed, and performed.It creates legendary aspects that imitate the emotions of the characters. It explores the issues of purpose and legacy-much questions why we should cherish humanity when we may not be worth it at all."
3335,10,"The best MCU movie ever When Ikaris rushing to the sun I almost cry 🤧 Ajek is sooooooo warm Sprite is a very deep character Druig is the most special, but in fact it is the one who loves humans the most Makkari is a very charming character as well Chloé Zhao did a fantastic job!!!!It's an Art."
3336,6,"Most Eternals either not likeable or one-dimensional. [likeable, multidimensional] Sersi [likeable, one-dimensional] Kingo, Gilgamesh [unlikeable, multidimensional] Ikaris, Sprite [unlikeable, one-dimensional] Makkari, Druig, Ajak, Thena, PhastosIt's almost funny. They're immortals who've lived for thousands of years, but are reduced to one single trait without any character arc whatsoever, be it edgy, unstable, mute, gay or Bollywood star. Some of the characters are reduced to just one trait that is repeated over and over lest you forget it while watching.Good job for creating one of the most forgettable MCU flicks yet. Tbh I don't want to see most of these characters ever again, except for Gemma Chan and Kit Harington."
3337,8,"Visually and Narratively Awesome I have to say that this story took me on a different and enjoyable travel through time, human emotions and, definitely, breakable precepts. Beacuse of their characters motives and auras related to locations and photography, results visually astonishing. I strongly recomend to revisit this movie to catch every historical reference. There's someting new on Marvel's proposals and I like them."
3338,6,"Could've been better For a movie based on Jack Kirby's vision, it misfires:In the comics it's filled with vibrant colors and really different setting than other stories of it's time and in the movie it was completely toned down, in avengers (2012) you had more colors.The movie was slow in pace, going back and forth in past and present of the characters, you couldn't figure out if you're in the beginning, middle or end of the film, so it felt somewhat plotless.. they could've done something completely different with the celestials that could actually be connected to what we've seen in the Loki Disney+ show or something to connect to guardians 3 but instead they said ""let's talk about feelings with almost 0 action"" I didn't had problem with the love scenes or even the first openly gay couple in the MCU, I just didn't care or thought of it as a crucial part of the plot but it's okay...Of course you can't make any movie today without gender swap some characters but, for those who haven't read the comics like myself (but I've read briefly and seen what it supposed to look like) it doesn't really matter, it just seemed like a normal character..Overall, I wanted to see one thing, got the other and I'm just disappointed, phase 4 is now fueled by almost no plot and no plan."
3339,8,"Unique, beautiful and something different Eternals is unique and something different and THATS what I love! The movie has plot twists I would've never guessed! You think you know how the story will continue and boom another plot twist and you know nothing again. At some points it can get a bit confusing but you can follow the Story at every point.I won and lost with that movie but I absolutely adored it.Critics said they missed the action it was too much storytelling but that's just not fair. Not every movie needs constantly fighting sequences. The movie lives from the storytelling you understand and start to like the eternals because of it. This kind of storytelling gives them a heart. You need the beginning and the whole story to feel something for them. Imagine to just get thrown into a story without knowing anything. You would be lost. I respect why some people say it can get a bit too long sometimes or kinda ""messy"" but we always needed the background story of our hero's to love them. The mcu would be nothing without background story's and the beginning of ours hero's and how they even had the chance to become our hero's.Go in there open minded for something new and you won't be disappointed."
3340,2,"Disappointing Thanks to our censorship in Malaysia who believe kissing can lead to pregnancy, all kissing scenes are gone!First impression: Zhao should stick to small budget non-action stories.And no, you can't blame the censorship for its choppy storytelling and weak editing. But the VFX is spectacular, though.And Disney has to squeeze a gay character into the film, brilliant!! Diversity is everything for a woke studio, I guess.#TGV please turn the bloody lights out during post credit Teasers.Might as well spend the money on another round of#DUNE.Https://www.jeremiahfoo.com/?p=267."
3341,10,"A beautiful movie. Eternals is something totally unique for the MCU. The cinematography, score, and character development are some of the best in the MCU thus far. It's truly a beautiful film. Hats off to Chloé Zhao!"
3342,2,"boring but it's good Sluggishly directed, it's a thunderously dull bland-out stuffed with all the things we've seen quite enough of: fights with big-jawed monsters; eyes that shoot energy beams; self-important longueurs; an all-but-incomprehensible story. Seriously: enough."
3343,9,"Treat this as a drama, not a marvel action movie I actually really liked this one. Because mainly I am getting bored with usual marvel movie.The main conflict is interesting, and the eternals are not heroes that punch bad guys out and safe the day. They need to struggle with inner dilemma. Which I really enjoyed.The bad thing is just that the movie is too ambitious, too many plot points being covered and at the end mostly are just brushed over.Overall, bravo marvel for trying something new!"
3344,1,"Bad Movie I don't understand what this movie is trying to convey anymore, it's trying to cram everything into it's unreasonable and of course the script is nowhere near new. A movie worse than Joss's Justice League."
3345,9,"A stunning sci-fi Epic! Chloé Zhao uses Eternals to create a sci-fi EPIC that reflects her sensibilities (and eye for beautiful landscapes). It's emotional, focusing on the characters' relationships and disagreements while also raising questions about humanity and the purpose of our creation. You go in expecting the ""marvel formula"" beat for beat you're bound to disappoint yourself. This is not a film that moves from action set piece to action set piece. We have WAYYY too many of those already. You go in expecting a sci-fi epic under the framing of a Marvel film and allow it to immerse you, you'll be all the better for it! Such a refreshing marvel film. Bravo Chloé Zhao! Go see this for yourself, don't go off the words of others."
3346,7,"It was okay Given that it's a Marvel movie my expectations where pretty high so I will say I was disappointed. In saying that it still is a good movie. I liked the naturistic scenes and i did like most characters. The plot is good but it took to long to explain the beginning of the Eternals and the explanation of each character wasn't as good. I wasn't involved in a way that when eternals died I didn't feel it. As Pros of the movie: it had a diverse cast and that I think is awesome, I do hope to see more of these main characters and secondary ones too in more movies."
3347,8,"flawed yet original and intresting movie Without spoiling anything this movie has a lot of intresting characters an interesting dillema at its center and good effects and action. Some were angry at the ""forced diversity"" in this movie since it features people of several races. I am greatful for that not because i am a fan of diversity but because such different features helped me differentiate and remember the cast and since they introduce about 8 new main characters it was neccasary to have them be instantly recognizable.Some of the new characters are genuinely interesting rounded characters and some are forgettable side characters. The deviants showcased in the trailer are uninteresting and do not do much besides facilitating action scenes. The movie is a bit meandering in the middle but a higher dialogue quality than usual for marvel keeps it interesting.In the end i think this was an interesting experiment for marvel and i want to see where it goes from here."
3348,10,"When Marvel gets a good director good things happen. I was sceptical about Eternals after being dissapointed by Black Widow and Shang-Chi, but how wrong I was.This movie is one of MCU's bests, beautiful cinematography, great acting and unexpected plot twists. Also some of the best CGI from any Marvel movie, the Celestials were just breathtaking and the sound design was absolutely astonishing, you should definitely watch this in theaters.Perhaps it feels a bit too long but it was necessary to tell the story of these god-like characters."
3349,9,"The start of something new.... While some marvel fans don't like this film because of the lack of action sequence, I think that this film is a promising start of something new. We have the opportunity of knowing who the eternals really are and what and who actually is in charge of the universe. This film has beautiful visuals from start to end, and all of this is thanks to chloe chao. When they announced this film, I was so excited to see Salma Hayek and Kit Harrison in the MCIU, although Salma's character died at the beginning, you can still see her presence in the complete film which is amazing, and for Kit, well....his character wasn't really that relevant to the story but I can tell that his character could develop in his own tv show on disney+.In conclusion, I think this film is so fresh and rare for Marvel Studios....and I'm into that!"
3350,2,"Messy and Cramp This is undeniably the worst Mcu movie ever made. Extremely draggy, underdeveloped superheroes , uninteresting, villains are suppose to be interesting but it became a messy direction. I feel sad for Kumail he trained so hard for his body but he barely does anything than 👉🏻 Pew pew. Jokes are barely funny at all , Chloe Zhao has failed to direct a superhero movie."
3351,7,"Better than critics say Eternals turned out to be a visual master piece with a great story line. The film contained a good balance of action sequences, romance and humour, keeping me off my seat for the better part of 2.5hrs. At times, the film may suffer from too many characters, lacking much character development but makes up for it by being the most unique and different marvel film."
3352,5,"Poor Extremely lazy writing, weak direction, disappointing plot, robotic acting, forced dialogs, deviant with most common appearance. Sad for Marvels legacy."
3353,10,The MCU's next big thing This is different from any Marvel but that's good and refreshing this movie explores new territory and expands the universe but shows heroes vulnerable to their emotions.
3354,10,"Marvel Storytelling At It's Finest! This is a spoiler free review. This was an ambitious film. The film was long. The cast was extensive. But they nailed it! The individual performances were excellent and the chemistry amongst characters was wonderful. The cinematography was stunning. This movie was well-rounded. It had heart. It made me mad. It made me sad. It made me laugh. I lost track of time and that was a great thing. For Marvel lovers, this movie really delivers. It ties into everything we know and unlocks so much more of the universe we know and love. I am stoked to see where these characters end up as far as the rest of the MCU goes. Feige knows! Chloe did her thing!"
3355,10,Amazing Movie Eternals is ride but well worth your time but watch it with an open mind this movie has so much to offer with a beautifully written story and incredible visuals.
3356,10,"Great movie Honestly a pretty amazing movie with amazing visuals, sad to see it get review bombed. It also opens the doors to phase 4 of the mcu, excited to see what's next."
3357,10,A Different kind of kind of Superhero Movie I'm soo shock I went in thinking what am I getting myself into but The Eternals is incredible Marvel took a lot of risk with this one and it wasn't in vain what a good movie.
3358,10,Wow!!! This movie is amazing! The story the characters are so well done and its visually stunning. Marvel has hit a new level this is easily in my top 5 Marvel movies.
3359,10,Masterpiece I love the characters so much Kingo and Spirte are instant new favorites. The visuals are breathtaking much like Dr. Strange this movie is long but what a journey can't wait to see what's next.
3360,10,"Loved it! Wow I got blown away by this movie! The cinematography and acting by the whole cast is on point. They chemistry is really good, and the fact that I cared about all 12 of the newly introduced characters in under 3 hours is a ""wow"" factor. Personal favourites are Thena and Gilgamesh."
3361,8,"Beautiful film Its an absolute beautiful film to me. It's definately so much different than any other Marvel movies. Lots of emotion, history and a little bit of sci-fi. I enjoyed it. All the ETERNALS acted their character really well."
3362,8,"A celestial scale movie that lands relatively well Eternals isnt a perfect movie, no MCU title is, but it doesn't deserve such a low score.The challenge of the film to introduce and flesh out so many characters is handled as well as it can be, each Eternal is developed enough and they all have well defined powers that play their role.The visuals are some of the best in the MCU, with the Deviants and the Celestials being particularly well designed, dominating the screen when visible.The soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi is at least 70% fire, with an amazing ethereal vibe that makes for great accompaniment to whats on screen.Again, not a perfect movie, but a very entertaining Phase 4 adventure with a great cast that sets up an exciting new side of the MCU, as well as some other exciting directions for one character in particular (stick around for both post credit scenes)"
3363,7,"Different, but refreshing Visually stunning.Different ""vibe"" than we know of Marvel, but very refreshing. Would almost say more calming and suiting. Love that it wasn't a cliché group, but very diverse, which just makes total sense.Don't forget: Some Avengers already had their solo films to explain the origin of their story. Even though it's not fully explained for the Eternals, almost each character will get (a part of) their story explained. This takes time and some might consider this too long with a slow pace. However very necessary for the film.Could've used a little more action, but think upcoming film(s) will have more of that and maybe even some solo films? It definitely leaves an open window for (a lot) more and the movie was interesting enough to leave you with questions you want to have answered!PS. Keep seated during the credits for the two addition scenes. You want to see more after this.PS. Proud of Angie. Very layered character. Love the roles she chooses to play."
3364,7,"Great concept, not many complaints, but big ones So, the first official critics rated Eternals that low because ""it doesn't fit into the regular Marvel setting"", what is absolutely true. But why would that be a bad thing? It's bringing a breath of fresh air to the MCU. The whole cast is bringing a good performance, there are many beautiful shots, camera work is good as well and the music by Ramin Dadjawi is unlike any Marvel soundtrack we've had before. Yes, the story isn't the MCU mainstream that we already know, but that's within the best thing about the movie. Also there are some twists that you don't see coming(provided you don't know the exact leak) which causes some conflicts among the Eternals.The negative points: -CGI. In like 2/3 of the movie the CGI is actually looking pretty good, but there are also a LOT of scenes(especially in the last act) where the visuals look really horrible, so that you wonder if you're watching an animated movie.-final: yes of course, after a movie with a story that is something new and creative we have to make a big CGI-puke where the world needs to end again, we are not spared from it. A pity charakters: !maybe a really really small spoiler! Some charakters that were great announced with their names totally fall by their wayside. One really popular actor has no scene in the whole movie from which there wasn't at least an extract in the trailers. Again....., a pity But all over all it's still a really good movie you should experience on a big screen, because that is, what it was made for."
3365,1,"An absolute mess What an absolute mess this film was. I felt nothing. The Deviants felt very out of place and fake. The humans served only as puppets to save, not much else. The Eternals look down on humans as if their behavior is any less sinful. There was nothing that made them any different. A truly incoherent film. Go watch Dune."
3366,7,"Different but refreshing Visually stunning.Different ""vibe"" than we know of Marvel, but very refreshing.Don't forget: Some Avengers already had their solo films to explain the origin of their story. Even though it's not fully explained for the Eternals, almost each character will get (a part of) their story explained. This takes time and some might consider this too long with a slow pace.

It definitely leaves an open window for (a lot) more and the movie was interesting enough to leave you with questions you want to have answered!PS. Keep seated during the credits for the two addition scenes. You want to see more after this."
3367,1,"Don't waste your time WHAT IS THAT????Just a bad film, bad screenplay, bad characters and boring... Probably one of the badest films of the year.Don't waste your time watching it."
3368,10,"A response to all the low ratings Eternals was a masterpiece!It was very different from what marvel often does, but wasn't that what they told us. And from my experience, it wasn't really in a bad way. As I walked into the cinema I was expecting something really different and that was also what I saw, it was truly a great experience and I did appreciate it. There was no reason for someone to give this movie a 1 star, what was it that made it receive such low ratings? This is a 200+ million budget film of course it's not going to be horrible, the lowest rating acceptable would be about a 6/7, with the reasoning being that it's not anyones cup of tea but this really isn't that bad of a movie. It's just not what marvel regularly brings us, and I can understand the reasoning for not liking what they brought us. Try to receive the movie with some cup of tea, as it really isn't a bad movie. Don't ruin the rating by rating it with a 1. Because it really isn't a movie deserving of a 1 star rating.And do we not appreciate the performance of the great actors in this movie and the amazing plot twists that nobody expected. The end credit scenes were although short truly amazing as well."
3369,3,"A good example of trying to much. Eternals was a movie I had zero feelings about going into the cinema. What I met was a way too long, way too poorly paced, and way too lacking in a lot of aspects. I felt like Eternals was a movie that wanted to be everything at once. It was an origin movie, a setup movie for the future of MCU, and an ensemble movie. In my opinion, it failed in every aspect simply because it tried to be everything at once.I had zero emotion invested in them as characters cause nobody had time to grow and connect with the audience, the movie failed in pacing cause it needed to explain way too much. The CGI was pretty and the first act of the movie is the strongest.The last 30 minutes of this movie is around the poorest MCU have made.I will see it again, in case I missed something but if you are a marvel fan then of cause you want to see it, I don't know who else would like this.It tries to answer some philosophical questions and I like that MCU wants to try this, but it does it half-hearted. It felt like it wanted to be something different and yet still felt into existing tropes.Well, it's pretty, a few good jokes and some decent action. Visual it should be viewed in the cinema, but as a film, you could rather watch it at home and drink every time the Eternals line up in a straight line - you are gonna get drunk."
3370,10,"Finally action meets story and character development Marvel for adults. To start off: INCREDIBLE CGI. Stylish, beautiful. The script is not heavy handed like all Marvel movies, laden with clichés and superhero tropes. This is a movie that merges sensibility with loads of mind-boggling action. Don't believe the critics - go see it."
3371,10,Don't understand the hate The movie is really good. They take enough time to explain and build the characters. The villains are well founded. I did not found any problems with the film. It is now on my top 5 marvel films! I really enjoyed it. If you immerse the story from the beginning you will really like it.
3372,4,"One-time movie To be honest, this movie was definetely below my expectations. The visuals and CGIs are amazing and the fight scenes are fun to watch. However, all the other things are just template things and simply boring. The story is too slow, there are a lot of scenes that are not really needed. And the cast, they were horrible. Sometimes I felt like they have no emotions at all. A bunch of DC characters ordered from Wish.All in all, it is definitely a one-time movie and all Marvel fans need to see it. But only once in a life."
3373,7,"Very eye pleasing, but streched out story. It's extremely beautiful, splendid VFX and sets. But it's a bit stretched out. This is not a two and a half hour movie. This plot and story would fit better in maybe one and a half hour. Max two hours. It got a bit boring at times. Will I watch it again? Most likely not. But I'm happy that I watched it. Not one of the best MCU movies, but definietely not the worst. I'd say that it's worth a watch."
3374,7,"feels like marvel just grew up First of all, this movie is not for everyone - most definitely not for kids, cos the slow pace, the dark theme and the story will just make the little brats yell 'borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring!' Like my 11 yo back then when he watched Captain Marvel (me and wife enjoyed it).If you expect a marvel/avengers movie, nope this is not it, it's not yet another super hero movie, it feels more like a 'movie' but not a 'super hero comic bookish movie'.The end of the story was a bit too artificial but overall not bad, and acting was solid, but the character growth can be stronger, especially with Sprite and Thena. Sometimes it's hard to feel what they feel if you know what I mean.Overall I give it 7/10 that's cos it could be better (pace/story telling) but will definitely watch again.Look forward to the sequel as well."
3375,6,"Goes on and on, and on, and on and a little longer This movie doesn't get close to what it could have been and it is EXTREMELY slow at times but let's start with the positives: Kumail Nanjiani and the visuals... that's about it more or less.Now to the negatives: I will try to not spoil anything but the characters make the stupidest decisions, they stand for something during the whole movie and then do a one eighty and do something completely else. Also Kit Harrington is in the movie for about three minutes. The characters, oh boy... most of them are really uninteresting and boring (Sprite, Druig, Thena, Makkari) had to Google all of their names while writing this cause I really couldn't care less about them. For me the most interesting ones were Ikaris (potential wasted) and Kingo. Also this movie seriously lacks an interesting villain. 6/10."
3376,7,"Marvel's SFX are unbeatable, the cast is legendary, the storyline was amusing but the pacing... I went into the theatre without setting high expectations as I usually do with the other MCU films. Since I knew that this film was meant to be slightly different to the others. Leaving the theatre, I felt a bit disheartened that I couldn't quite connect with the characters as much as I wanted to.It's inevitable with such a large A-list cast, that they would all have to divide up the screen-time & make sure each character was given enough spotlight.However, I found that even with Cersei & Ikaris claiming most of the screen time, I still couldn't find myself rooting for their relationship because I wasn't taken on that journey of how their relationship developed. Sure, there were a few montages to show they were inlove & Ikaris watching Cersei braid a little girls hair and smile lovingly at her but that really was it. Just short moments of them staring at eachother & smiling.That wasn't enough for me to really feel a connection & care for them.Infact, I found myself caring for Thena & Gilgamesh aswell as Makkari & Druig, more.The concept of their familial relationship that stemmed from the Avengers family, didn't have the same impact. We have been taken on a 10 year journey already, revolving around the Avengers & how they all fought each other and then united together.I understand that Marvel was trying to portray the Eternals as this broken up family whom once were very much united & that we should care. But I found myself wishing that they had separated Eternals into part 1 & part 2. Part 1 focussing on the Eternals & how they came to be and them in their first 5000 centuries being a close family & eventually at the end of part 1, them having to split ways. Then Part 2 them having to find eachother again & save the universe, etc.Although longer than the usual MCU runtime, 2 & 1/2 hours wasn't enough to invoke a strong emotion from me because there was too much ground to cover that they weren't able to go into depth with many things.Overall, it felt a bit lacklustre. I really tried hard to love it. Perhaps in my second watch, I will feel differently.If you're reading reviews to decide whether it's worth watching, please don't be put off by the more negative reviews. Just go into the cinema with broad mindset. I still enjoyed the movie just not as much as I wanted to.There are plenty of twists, deaths & the two post-credit scenes are very much impactful to the future of MCU."
3377,8,An astonishing work One of the most beautiful and astonishing Marvel films. The pace is a bit slow but I don't mind that much. Some interessting characters with great actors. I'm curious how Eternals will fit in the future of the MCU.
3378,8,"Big and heavy story Eternals has a big, heavy, galactic story. The movie is great. It's not a topical marvel movie. So I can understand some people will dislike it. Need to see the movie again to absort the story more."
3379,10,chloé zhao marry me This is a very chaotic review so prepare: I had high expectations of this mostly because of chloé zhao and the trailer which showed simply the most stunning visuals a marvel movie has ever shown and to be honest i was genuinely blown away. The visuals obviously are stunning and so well done but the story as well is nicely thought out and interesting and the movie definitely kept me on the edge of my seat and surprised me. I also have to emphasize the connection to the general history the story depicts which is just so interesting to see. I literally only have good things to say so i might be biased but this in my opinion is so worth it folks and i genuinely enjoyed it from the first minute to the end. Keep in mind however that this obviously is quite different from most mcu films so if you go into this expecting you know blockbuster superhero stuff well you probably won't get that.
3380,9,"Another example of critics not knowing anything. I rarely review films but I wanted to go out of my way to review this one. I loved Eternals. I have no idea where all these bad reviews are coming from. Easily top ten MCU for me.The film is visually stunning, the humour is perfect, and the characters and story telling are awesome. This film deserves so much more love."
3381,6,Just way too long! As expected it's visually spectacular with great CGI and photography. Acting is mostly good and the story is actually not so bad but this should never have been a 2.35 hour movie. I don't mind a slow paced movie that builds up towards the end but so many scenes are there seemimgly without a purpose or could at least have been cut in half. Too bad because this could have been a pretty good movie if the story had been told differently and in a more suspensfull manor.
3382,10,Marvel hits it out of the park with The Eternals Words can't begin to explain how good this movie is. I feel like people didn't know what to expect especially with the critics and hate groups review bombing this movie but I went in with an open mind and well done Marvel this is a truly amazing film.
3383,10,Eternals is beautiful The Eternals comics is a lovecraftian gloom and doom with a bunch heroes whose relationships aren't exactly good the movie hits these notes perfectly. This movie proves Marvel is heading in the right direction.
3384,10,Emotional and Epic Eternals changes everything! With a beautifully developed characters that take their own broken family relationships and the threat of the deviants. The Eternals may not be for everyone but this instantly one of my favorites mcu movies.
3385,6,"It tried doing too much. It was alright. 6.5/10 for me. It had some great humor and action scenes. But it was plagued with lots of boring exposition.More importantly, the emotional moments lacked impact for me since I barely knew most of the characters and their motivations. Civil War, Infinity War and Endgame were great because they had standalone movies leading up to them. This movie tried to introduce a plethora of new characters and lore while also having an epic conclusion. It tried doing too much.The best parts of this movie are the more down-to-earth scenes where we can relate to the eternals and the parts where their ideologies conflict. The visuals are also gorgeous, as is to be expected with Marvel. It's pretty to look at, and it will occasionally make you laugh, but most of the substance is forgettable."
3386,2,"Worst Marvel movie ever As a die hard Marvel fan, I was very excited for this one. Especially with Richard Madden in it. Unfortunately it was utterly disappointing...the story was weak and the characters had no depth whatsoever. Hopefully the next movie can redeem this embarassement of the MCU:("
3387,5,"Marvels sameness held up by emotional performances and expert direction Easily the best part about Eternals is, like all other Marvel properties, what makes it different from the rest. In this case it is the visual landscape of the film, across the variety of locations DP Ben Davis and director Chloé Zhao capture a naturalness of the environments they shoot allowing the characters to feel alive in these settings rather than floating in a space of nothingness. The lighting team impressively made a Marvel film one of the most beautifully lit films of the year.The next major highlight was the performances by the whole cast, everyone legitimately killed it.The glaring flaw was obviously the training wheels feeling that is implemented by Marvel itself, having to fit inside the box is the thing that is keeping niche concepts like an eternal race of gods and the stories that can evolve from that, well...evolving."
3388,10,"Cannot recommend enough Amazing movie. Very different and exciting compared to other marvel films. If you have a hard time dealing with change and new things, this movie might not be for you. If you do, you are guaranteed to love it!"
3389,8,"Truely bombastic and visually stunning I really really loved the movie. Storytelling and worldbuilding were awesome. Paired with never seen before visuals for both quiet scenes and action scenes. You can indeed argue that some dialogue were repeating and not truly necessary, but for the main characters, Ikaris and Scersi, the deepdive into their world via dialogue is inevitable. It is a lengthy movie we're casuals got a lot to unpack. In fact, you encounter 8 characters plus a minor love interest plus several historical scenes, which needs to digest at first, but it is in my opinion very well done and presented. Also it is fun, I really laughed had at some scenes.Transitions & Storytelling & Worldbuilding: 4/5 Story: 3.5/5 Action: 3.5/5 Visuals: 5/5 Sounddesign: 5/5 Characterdesign: 4/5 Fun: 4/5 Implications for current MCU: 5/5So, it's a solid 4 out of 5."
3390,10,"Eternals are great.. critics are not. This is my second review ever in imdb. This movie wasnt bad.. its far away from bad. One of the best from mcu. Acting is great, characters are great, story is great and there is also good plot twists. It still feels like a mcu movie but still a little different.. and that is a good thing.. not sure why critics are saying so much bad things about this Marvel epic. Like one of the actors said they pissed of the right people."
3391,2,"Just a Cinematic Mess They choose to approach this movie by spending all the time working on the cinematography instead of a story line.Eternals suppose to be the best of all 3, Humans and Deviants, but they are portray with so much flaw by choosing the worst attributes of a Human.The redemption arc is almost close to none, making this movie so redundant. Nothing memorable to make us want to see them again.Deviants which could be explored more upon are just a side piece for actions, and convenience to the plot.So much build up for nothing much spectacular to see."
3392,5,"Gods are not heroes An esoteric film, not easy to watch.Philosophically the message on faith above all and finally freeing oneself from manipulation, seems to me understandable because of the rise of fundenmatalism.Between prophecy and reality, a marvel like no other."
3393,10,"A tragedy, a human one, profound and in the most epic way This one-of-a-kind movie is a story like an ode to this planet, its history, but moreover the humanity, from its worst to its best aspects... And the complexity of life, whoever you are, the role we can choose or not to play... Yes, all these choices and opposite beliefs that make this world a big dramatic mess at times, but also a wonderful place that happens to generate the most magnificent things there is... And how deep, heartfelt connections are a decisive factor ; because love, in the end, is what matters and gives any life trajectory a more fulfilled feel... Even if this love takes you to your absolute demise, your existence will nonetheless have had a greater meaning and resonance with it...The movie tackles major philosophical themes ; and through the intimacy of its diverse characters, resonates on a higher plane... Each of The Eternals live a personal tragedy and have to face their doubts, dilemmas and demons, existential questions that go way further than anyone's perception... But as a connected family at its core, they also show the most admirable and moving aspects of what it means to be alive and aware of this incredible world around us...Probably the most gorgeous movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, virtuosically staged (congratulations to Chloe Zhao), every actor/actress fits his/her role perfectly, and they all deliver poignant performances. There are numerous deep emotional moments, in addition to all these striking epic sequences that obviously find their climax in the later parts of the movie (entwined with a heartbreaking dramaturgy that amplifies the emotional impact of it all). The score is a true gem and the entire production is a pure delight. Not a ""Space Opera"", but a ""Mythological Opera""...Definitely a Marvel movie that can't be compared to any other of the franchise... But from this little masterpiece of a movie, are seeds that open to numerous exciting possibilities ! Whether it is for each of The Eternals we've discovered and seen marvelously blossom all through this grand adventure ; but also for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole and in its most extended sense !..."
3394,9,"The next Marvel installment The movie has a different feel as compared to past Marvel movies but I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. And with this many new stars in the Marvel Universe within a single movie, theres bound to be certain characters which barely had any screen time, so hopefully we will see more of them in the sequels or in any other Marvel movies.All in all it was definitely enjoyable and the explanations on certain cosmic level history of the Marvel Universe was so awesome to see!"
3395,7,"More of an origin story than anything... The movie goes more into the origins of the eternals and gives you an insight into each of their personalities. Don't go in expecting an all out established set of characters kicking ass from start to finish. The story is fairly well told but I must admit that it does lack some action but the action you do get is very well done and visually stunning, especially those that feature Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Makkari the speedster. It is hard to see how these characters will have a future intertwined with the rest of the MCU stories but it does day ""the eternals will return..."" at the end."
3396,10,"An otherworldly experience.... Wow! This is nothing like any of the earlier MCU movies. Kudos to Chloé Zhao for stepping out of MCU's comfort zone in creating a visionary experience and a film that stands out for its stunning location shots, eye-popping action scenes, a diverse cast (including Marvel's first gay character) and infectious performances - thumbs up to the two leads Gemma Chan and Richard Madden for their engaging screen presence and chemistry. There's plenty of humour and wit too, and despite its almost 160 minute run-time, the movie moves at breakneck speed to tell its story of the origins of mankind. A great turning point for Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
3397,4,"Overrated & not on par with expectations The beginning of the movie was great, provide a clear insight & some relevance with previous endgame title, but everything went downwards & derailed soon after.One major issue, too many characters & most of the characters were not well developed, some characters are quite redundant & seems to be very awkward throughout the movie.Second major issue, we cant helped feeling the entire movie was pretty rushed & it seems like the script writer ran out of idea in continuing the story in a logical way, they attempted something very unexpected but however it ended up very disturbing & downright disgusting.Third major issue, very promising casts & crews but however not properly utilized, everyone seems to be very out of place & cant helped feeling the major leads were too scattered & unable to lead the audiences to follow the directions which they attempted.Conclusion, if this movie wasn't an avengers & marvel title, i would definitely not watch at all.My 4 stars rating goes entirely to the graphic & visual team who did a good job in making this mess slightly adaptable. Otherwise, i would not hesitate to give a 1 star rating if i could."
3398,8,"It was actually good! I don't know why so many people gave it slack. I saw the bad reviews so expected nothing from it, forget that it was Marvel and just sat down in the theatre to enjoy a well shot movie instead.But to my surprise it wasn't bad at all! It's different, but not bad at all."
3399,7,"Enjoyed the Movie It was a great movie overall.Not a typical, colorful MCU movie but good visuals nonetheless. A little too much CGI and VFX but I guess they are eternal so that makes sense i suppose.Had love-hate relationship with lots of characters, mainly Druig.Love a little bit of Bollywood mashup in the movie and funny side character Karun.Looks like MCU is taking a new shape and the new villain is wayyy wayyy wayyyyyyyyy too big (shape, size and power). If i'm not mistaken, the celestial being formed a black hole towards the end, that should tell how powerful it is.Overall, loved it. Will watch it again soon. Not Shang-Chi good, but not Thor: Dark World bad.Giving it a 7 out of 10."
3400,10,"Good film, good characters Very entertaining, I wasn't aware a whole 2.5hrs had been passed until I left the theater. The story is attracting, the history is epic, the love is touching. I especially like Gilgamesh and Thena. The oath of guardian is just ... eternal."
3401,3,"Good Elements... But Lackluster It's far better than I thought it would be, to call this worse than Ant-Man and The Wasp is braindead.The CGI is great, some performances are really good (not you Selma Hayek), the story had a few clever elements, the representation is great, deserved and needed, I think the costumes look great and Zhao did a good job directing.Bryan Tyree Henry was the best part of the movie, his character was dope and I wish they did more with him and that he had more screen time.Richard Madden (aka worse but sexy Homelander) and Gemma Chan were the standouts here, each elevating their material even when it becomes ridiculous and crazy.Ok the downside is that this movie really has no idea what it wants to be. It's tone completely changes constantly, some characters just turn evil and then good again, oh and some literally just leave lol.It wants to have the grandeur of a world ending threat that's so unbelievably impossible for the characters to solve that they're forced in their third act to come up with this ridiculously easy and stupid plan that is right out of a Power Rangers movie.The villains are boring, forgettable and underdeveloped, plus the CGI for the lead deviant is horrendous. The worst part about this is that the movie knows how bad the villain is because then, you know, the main cast of characters basically become the villains themselves.Some performances are pretty dry, especially from Salma Hayek who looks so miserable to be there, it really sucks. Angelina Jolie's character is cool but her performance kinda lacks, she's a completely forgettable character that does and achieves very little.Kumil Nanjiani's character also just leaves and does nothing in the third act and then gets credit.One characters name is literally Sprite lmao, like the soft drink.The pacing is kinda all over the place, the movie is pretty boring, which is weird for a Chloe Zhao film, since Nomadland flows so beautifully.Look, it was better than I thought it would be, it has nice moments but overall it's kind of a giant mess.Chloe Zhao did the best she could but yeah it was like ""eh"", it's no 'The Suicide Squad' 😎Oh and also they reference DC characters in the movie??? Wtf."
3402,5,"Don't get me wrong, I kinda liked it by the end... Maybe there's just too much going on to really nail things properly? Maybe it just takes a bit too long to get to where it's going?... or just too many unfamiliar characters to get to know?.... I'm not sure, but halfway through this I was starting to think it's one of the worst things marvel has produced to date. I felt like probably 2/3rds of the film was just trying to get you up to date with what was going on, so by the time it actually got started properly I was already a bit done with it. It pulls itself back a bit with some impressive action scenes and special effects, but the characters just feel a bit sacrificial and most are probably not going to be important moving forward. I like some of the ideas it opens up in the franchise but it all just felt a bit forced..... a bridge to where marvel is taking things perhaps."
3403,3,"I felt like watching an extended SNL sketch of a bad heroes movie I had to make an account just to talk about Eternals. Honestly, I already knew the critics had mixed thoughts about it, but I wanted to see it for myself.The criticism is accurate. It is bad.I guess we all had the feeling that Marvel did a great job building up the story from the Avengers, and that releasing a movie with so many new heroes at once could be a mistake. Well, that's what it was.Having that singer in the post credit scene... what was that? Dude, you already mentioned BTS and even played their song (which should've been enough as a sign you didn't trust your film to succeed by itself) but then to add him too? The whole movie felt like a sketch from SNL with a special guest.Honestly, I am not looking forward to the next movies from Eternals. I am hoping next month I'm not disappointed by the spider-man one, and I don't even care if all three actors are in it. I just hope Marvel took their time to make a good story with good dialogues.I could go on with more but I don't want to spoil the movie seeing this is the first review. I have a feeling the fans who are defending marvel from the critics will change their minds after actually watching Eternals.All being said, I guess I just needed to vent. I should've watched dune again instead of this."
3404,5,"Absolutely twisty (not in a good way) I'm gonna keep this simple.Ajak is dead, betrayed and killed by Ikaris. ( I thought Druig was slightly malevolent, I was wrong).Intro about Eternals felt like Starwars at the beginning of the movie. The intro of their powers was all over the place. You don't even see what some of them are capable of. After all, their powers are melted into who they are as Eternals.No explanation about Celestials. Sersi freezes this Celestial on Earth and there was no mention that he is/was The Destroyer. They win and Harry Styles shows up as Starfox when Sersi, Phastos and Kingo taken by Areshim (and Starfox knows where Areshim had taken them to) in the post credit scene.Why would you introduce a new character when you have lacked the character building already?I yawned watching the movie and I have never, ever done that watching Marvel movie.Makkari was the best character with brilliant visual effects. You will experience it when she fights Ikaris as the end of the movie. THE BEST. The rest was just slow and boring to watch. Guardians of the Galaxy, when they introduced new characters with a ridiculous villain, was far better to watch. That movie was entertaining and fun.This movie was meant to be serious and crucial but lacked the serious story telling and pace.Oh, Gilgamesh dies to a strong deviant and he becomes the two legged deviant that fights Thena in the trailer. Thena cuts that deviant off in 2 seconds. That deviant meant to be super powerful sucking off from Eternals powers.It is absolutely messy story."
3405,7,"So disappointed! All that hype for nothing! Been wanting to see this one with my SO for weeks if not months, but after seeing it, I can say nothing but: what a huge drag of a movie! Don't watch!"
3406,9,"See it with open mind I understand why there are bad review by critics and user. If you expect it is an avenger or related to any part of MCU up to endgame movie, you will be disappointed. Instead try to enjoy it with open mind just like the guardian of the galaxy 1. For many when guardian of the galaxy was out it was not related to any avenger when it come out. Marvel is trying hard to build phase 4, introducing new characters and it is hard to get everyone to love all 10 characters in 2.5hours. In the future I think they will connect the dots to another avenger type movie. Do stay for the 2 post credit scene."
3407,9,"More cinema than marvel Amazing film, it is very different from the usual marvel movie. Awsome story and great fight scenes. Hope to see more like this mixed in with the more traditional MCU movies."
3408,7,"Definitely Different First of all, I'm going to have to watch this again. There is too much to unpack for just one viewing. There is so much exposition that I got confused often. Especially when bouncing between time periods. The cinematography was fantastic! The action was pretty good. Angelina Jolie was the highlight for me. Can't wait to see fight along side some Avengers. It would have a higher score if it was shorter, had better story flow, & more character balance. I mean, Kit Harrington is barely in it! Ends on a cliffhanger and shows clear direction for where they are going next. I just hope we get to see it!"
3409,7,"Great visual, poor character and plot Eternals introduces us to a new set of MCU characters with interesting characteristic and superpowers. Visually, the movie is beautiful, the cinematography is great and the visual effects of the super powers are impressive. However, what it had in visuals, it lacked in plot. The narrative and character development wasn't great, and at some points it felt like it was too divided or it tried to tell too many stories. The dialogue in many scenes felt a bit unnatural and sometimes cringey. I still recommend people to watch it, but don't go in with high expectations."
3410,6,"Hit and miss Clearly this film is taking a different approach than what we normally see in a MCU film. The themes are much more dark and carry more emotional weight with them. Chloe Zhao's direction while I thought was great in this film and kept to her style, I just don't think it might fit in the MCU thought. It seems out of place almost because of how different this story is delivered. The story was also a bit messy I thought, with the time jumps going back and forward making it confusing to tie loose ends. And it was also a weak story might I add, because I felt that there wasn't much excitement happening in the film, especially during the second act. There wasn't much development with many of the eternals, as it's too hard for a 2 1/2 hour film to develop 10+ characters deep enough for audiences to feel some sort of emotion towards them. Performances and visuals were stunning though, very good looking film on the big screen. Dolby atmos surround sound delivers also adding immersive experience while watching. The action was a bit light I thought, but the scenes we get are again great visually and choreographed well. The final battle was a bit underwhelming I thought also. It would of worked better as a TV series maybe, but then the visual aspects would be under appreciated if seen on a TV and not a giant imax screen. But this film still adds more clues as to what may happen in the future of the MCU."
3411,1,"No. Avoid movie this at all costs. It adds nothing new, we've seen it all before and not in a good way. The acting was good, the scenes looked good, but everything felt so forced and unoriginal and uninspiring that it it was impossible for me to sit this one out. Spare yourself the money, and visit a loved one instead."
3412,6,"Where are all the bad comments coming from?? So I was one of the lucky ones who saw the movie on November 2nd already. I saw a lot of bad comments before I watched the movie so my expectations were already a bit lower. But I still think that Chloé did an amazing job in figuring out te possibilities to introduce 10 new characters without making a mess. I think she gave us enough time to get emotional attached to the Eternals in the movie. The action and special effects in the movie were amazing and well organized. I do think that some things were out of place but overall, it wasn't a bad movie."
3413,5,"Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently. Eternals (2021) : Movie Review -Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it.MCU's recent projects have done great without theatrical release and notably, those came after 'Endgame'. 'Black Widow' and fresh fruit 'Shang Chi' earned back box office glory for them. I would have been happy to see them trying something nee after Endgan though. Something like what DC did with 'Joker'. Eternals does not depend on any such backdrop, it's a standalone product and maybe that's it will take some more time to create fan following. In the film, the Eternals, an immortal alien race, emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their evil counterparts, the Deviants. The screenplay here is not confusing at all but it is terribly slow. Marvel's Filmmaking may take a new turn from here as they have tried something calm this time, unlike super explosive narratives we saw in previous films. However, they couldn't try out something completely different from the trademark they carry which makes this film highly predictable.The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely not flawless but it isn't lame either. Creating a new universe for old fans might have put extra burden and that can be noticed in the film. It has those typical jokes carrying childish humour which you have left behind, 15 years ago. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. It slows down the vehicle anyway, almost to the level when you feel like having a little nap without taking those glasses off.Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. However, the performances aren't that great. Some characters don't even make any sense considering the kind of powers they have. Somewhere, the writing is also responsible for that. Indian fans, please do not melt when you see Indian faces but please laugh when they crack hilarious one-liners. Visually, Eternals is splendid. The IMAX experience makes it truly wonderful and appealing. Marvel's VFX team has provided them a much needed boost here.No doubts, the whole thing is long. Sometimes it feels like, is it gonna take MCU's Phase Five to reach the End? That eternal longing certainly hurts the film but rest assured, it's a standard Marvel Film. Chloé Zhao puts all the elements demanded by Marvel Fans while she deliberately ignores unnecessary dramatic scenes. Was she driving towards daily-soap pulp? I think yes. This is 2021 and you are still using 2011 cliches to add some gags in the film? Seriously? I mean the film is made only for new kids or what? Let the fans decide that. They don't care much about content anyways because if they had, Marvel would have moved on from money-spinners to classic cinema long time ago. Nevertheless, Eternals is a grand visual treat which deserves to be watched only and only in 3D. Yes, Marvel Fans can flock into theatres to scream out for the new superheroes this Diwali while others can skip it for their own good.RATING - 5/10*"

I gave 5 is me trying to say thank you that this movie not have 2 parts.Well chloe definitely trying to please fans with so many things but in the end it just didn't meet the bare minimum. The joke, the character build-ups, actions, even the transition was very rough. Chloe no doubt is great making Oscar worthy dramas but she is not the right person to direct even to make the script this adaption.There's not enough apparent experience between characters to make an exploration of these ""eternals"" complicated feelings possible, making it's dis appealingSomewhere directors of Thor trilogy is breathing a sigh of relief; he's no longer responsible for the worst Marvel film.Lastly please don't use any outside MCU's references. It's just not the right place."

However I was fairly invested in the story and the movie overall left a good taste.+ The movie has Great Cast. Almost all the actors did a great job and characters were memorable. My favorites are Sersi, Ikaris, Thena, Kingo, Phastos and Makkari. It's not like every single one of them has an arc or anything ... but they all do leave some impression and are likable characters.I really liked this movie's aesthetics, from the Deviants to superpowers. The music was nice and there are some beautiful shots throughout the film.I really liked the lore with the Celestials. That part had some cool visuals!I also liked the philosophical questions the heroes face in the story. Even though I felt like it could've been handled a little bit better.- The first half could be boring tho. In fact, I have a strong feeling that a Lot of people are gonna find this movie boring. There aren't THAT much action. And most of the action scenes are Fine.The first act in particular has some time-jumps and it can feel a little bit messy.Even though I initially gave it a 7, I do have a feeling that the movie is gonna age poorly upon Rewatch and Rethinking... Just like Black Widow.There are many scenes that are supposed to be emotional. And some moments in the final act are indeed emotional. However, in the first act of the movie there are moments where you are supposed to feel something but you just can't. There are not enough development done so you are not feeling the necessary emotions...The Deviants looked cool but that's it. Nothing special about them.+ Back to positives.... I really liked Makkari, the depiction of her speed power is, IMO, better than that of MCU quicksilver and dceu flash. I really hope we see her speed force more.Overall, the movie does kinda feel different from the other MCU movies. Some parts are messsy or boring, but great cast, visuals and lore made this movie overall good.7/10 ⭐⭐⭐1/2 (might go down to 6.5 IDK)"

Yeah, there are scenes that just must be seen on the big screen, and the fact that it was shot in real locations says enough about the size of the film. The big cosmic scenes will make you feel small. It's shot with a massive scope, looking visually different and intimate. Chloé Zhao has a really unique visual stamp. The cinematography is georgeous!Eternals brings to our attention a lot of new and interesting information that will change the course of the Marvel universe. Chloé Zhao has created the most diverse MCU film to date - an emotionally epic one. The ensemble has great chemistry and everyone gets their moments to show off mastery. Their power sets are different and presented interestingly and beautifully.It has laughs, great surprises, twists and heart to go with the gigantic, crowded story it unpacks. There are some real-life questions that are brought to our attention - some people will like it, some not. I personally got zero problems with it, as a whole the movie is maybe one of the most matures in the MCU.At times it doesn't even feel like a ""next comicbook movie"", it's just a beautiful one, which will leave you hanging with some questions.Ramin Djawadi's score sounds amazing in all of the scenes, mixed with the fight, which are just epic and creative. I got no other words to express it.Easily this is one of the most important MCU movies for the future and you'll see why. I recommend that you do not be influenced by the rehearsals of people who purposefully hate the film, but look at the constructive things that are being written. It's not the best movie in the franchise, but it's a successfully taken risk, that will pay off in the years to come.My only minor problems are that some of the characters were built better than others, but also there are 10 new character that we see for first time. The other one is that the story jumps from one period to another one idea more than desired and I also understand, that the group is scattered around the world in the beginning of the movie. That doesn't change the fact that Eternals is a must for the big screen if you're a movie buff and a true Marvel fan.About the credit scenes...both are great, both will get you on the edge of your seat!"
